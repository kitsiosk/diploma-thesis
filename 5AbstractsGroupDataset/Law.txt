 equal right to the poor by law  federal judges must swear or affirm that they will  do equal right to the poor and to the rich   this frequently overlooked oath  which i call the  equal right principle   has historical roots dating back to the bible and entered us law in a statute passed by the first congress  today  the equal right principle is often understood to require only that judges faithfully apply other laws  but that reading  like the idea that the rich and poor are equally barred from sleeping under bridges  is questionable in light of the equal right principle s text  context  and history  this article argues that the equal right principle supplies at least a plausible basis for federal judges to consider substantive economic equality when implementing underdetermined sources of law  there are many implications  for example  the equal right principle suggests that federal courts may legitimately limit the poor s disadvantages in the adjudicative and legislative processes by expanding counsel rights and interpreting statutes with an eye toward economically vulnerable groups  the equal right principle should also inform what qualifies as a compelling or legitimate governmental interest within campaign finance jurisprudence  as well as whether to implement  underenforced  equal protection principles  more broadly  the equal right principle should play a more central role in constitutional culture  the united states is unusual in that its fundamental law is relatively silent on issues of economic equality  the equal right principle can fill that void by providing a platform for legal and public deliberation over issues of wealth inequality  through judicial confirmation hearings and other forms of public contestation  the equal right principle can help to specify federal judges  legal and moral commitments toward the poor  
 i shall talk to my own people  the intersectional life and times of lutie a  lytle in 1898  recent law graduate lutie a  lytle a black woman born to formerly enslaved parents accepted a position as instructor of law at a law school in tennessee  in doing so  she became the first black woman law professor in the world  over the following four decades  despite suffering persistent racial and gender discrimination  lytle committed her life and work to  in her words   mak ing  a sincere and earnest effort to improve  black americans   condition as citizens   this article details lytle s life as an advocate  activist  and attorney  and argues that her work places her squarely within the ranks of the black feminist intelligentsia that emerged in the late nineteenth century  in addition  the article highlights lytle s disappearance from public life  and the public record  in the early 1940s  and suggests that her pioneering career warrants additional research into her final years  
 i want to be able to walk the street without fear  transforming justice for street harassment the practices comprising the analytic category of street harassment are rarely responded to through either criminal or restorative justice approaches  and the possibilities for transformative justice have to date not been considered  in this article we advocate for a victim centred justice response to street harassment  specifically examining the potential for transformative justice to function in this way  drawing on data from a recent australian study  we examine participants  understandings of justice and desired justice responses to street harassment  participants  responses drew attention to a range of perceived shortcomings of the formal justice system as a mechanism for responding to street harassment  instead  participants advocated for a justice response concerned with transforming cultural and structural norms  in particular gender norms  we end in an examination of the limitations of transformative justice  looking to recent work on  kaleidoscopic justice  as a way of transforming common conceptions of justice itself  
 i m giving you a lawful order  dialogic legitimacy in sandra bland s traffic stop on july 10  2015  a young african american woman named sandra bland was stopped by state trooper officer brian encinia for failing to signal a lane change  what began as a routine traffic stop quickly devolved into shouting  a physical confrontation  and bland s subsequent arrest  we use discourse analysis to examine the rapid escalation of this encounter with a focus on procedural justice  sunshine   tyler 2003  and the dialogic approach to legitimacy  bottoms   tankebe 2012   in analyzing the transcript of sandra bland s traffic stop  we address several key questions  how is procedural justice manifested linguistically  can the dialogic legitimacy framework be used to understand the dynamics of individual police citizen interactions  the conclusions of this analysis provide an interdisciplinary view of how procedural justice and legitimacy are manifested and negotiated in a police citizen interaction  
 it s a really grey area  an exploratory case study into the impact of the jackson reforms on organised insurance fraud the jackson reforms were designed to address the mounting cost of uk civil justice by reducing personal injury claims  costs  yet the government presented them as part of wider counter insurance fraud initiatives  this case study utilises counter fraud practitioner interviews and industry data to explore the reforms  impact on organised insurance fraud  the study highlights how a market of supplier induced demand may exist in the personal injury market whereby fraud need only be committed by one actor to have a financial benefit to other parties  such a situation causes difficulties identifying actual fraud  particularly as actors may unconsciously participate  despite this the insurance industry has already publicised its own conclusions and supports further reforms to the sector  this study will argue that without further examination of the jackson reforms subsequent reforms may inadvertently serve to shift fraud into new areas and cause further challenges for counter fraud practitioners   c  2017 elsevier ltd  all rights reserved  
 let s play  youtube and twitch s video game footage and a new approach to fair use some of the most watched user  created videos on the internet are recordings of individuals playing video games  these are commonly referred to as  let s play  videos  the revenue that these videos can generate on youtube and twitch tv has created a multi  billion dollar industry  unfortunately  this burgeoning industry utilizes copyright protected works  some video game companies assert that  let s play  videos infringe upon their copyright protection  the  let s play  community claims that their videos fall within the fair use defense to copyright infringement claims  this note analyzes how a court would apply the fair use defense to  let s play  videos  my analysis finds that precedential case law is unfavorable to  let s play  videos  and that a court would most likely find that none of the four factors involved in the fair use defense analysis support protecting  let s play  videos  this note goes on to suggest that a compulsory license would be the best solution to balance the interests between the  let s play  community and video game companies in this context  
 life s hurried tangled road  a therapeutic jurisprudence analysis of why dedicated counsel must be assigned to represent persons with mental disabilities in community settings the right to counsel is a fundamental right for individuals facing criminal processes and involuntary civil commitment  however  individuals with serious mental illnesses are subject to many community proceedings  e g   being taken by law enforcement to a crisis drop off center  where counsel is not available  we argue that  unless meaningful counsel is provided in such situations  the cycle of arrest  hospitalization  and stays in the community will continue for these individuals  who are among some of the most disenfranchised citizens in the nation and are often without any meaningful voice  
 natural  and unnatural  medical deaths and coronial law  a uk and international review of the medical literature on natural and unnatural death and how it applies to medical death certification and reporting deaths to coroners  natural unnatural death  a scientific review in the united kingdom  when people die  either a doctor writes an acceptable natural cause of death medical certificate  or a coroner  fiscal in scotland  investigates the case  usually with an autopsy  an inquest may or may not follow  the concept of natural or unnatural cause  death is not internationally standardized  this article reviews scientific evidence as to what is a natural death or unnatural death and how that relates to the international classification of deaths  whilst there is some consensus on the definition  its application in considering whether to report to the coroner is more difficult  depictions of deaths in terminal care  medical emergencies and post operative care highlight these difficulties  it secondly reviews to what extent natural and unnatural are criteria for notification of deaths in england and wales and internationally  it concludes with consideration of how medical concepts of unnatural death relate in england and wales to coroners  legal concepts of what is unnatural  deaths that appear natural to clinicians and pathologists may be legally unnatural and vice versa  it is argued that the natural unnatural dichotomy is not a good criterion for reporting deaths under medical care to coroners  but the notification of a medical cause of death  using the international classification of disease codes and the medical professional view as to whether it is scientifically natural  is of great value to the coroner in deciding whether it is legally unnatural  
 no money down bankruptcy this article reports on a breakdown in access to justice in bankruptcy  a system from which one million americans will seek help this year  a crucial decision for these consumers will be whether to file a chapter 7 or chapter 13 bankruptcy  nearly every aspect of their bankruptcies both the benefits and the burdens of debt relief will be different in chapter 7 versus chapter 13  almost all consumers will hire a bankruptcy attorney  because they must pay their attorneys  many consumers will file chapter 13 to finance their access to the law  rather than because they prefer the law of chapter 13 over chapter 7  attorneys charge about  1 200 to file a chapter 7 bankruptcy  their debt laden clients must pay this amount up front  attorneys charge about  3 200 to file a chapter 13 bankruptcy  but clients can pay attorneys  fees over time as part of their cases  chapter 7 and 13 bankruptcies also differ in the relief achieved  almost all chapter 7 cases end with the debtor receiving a discharge of debts  in contrast  only around one third of chapter 13 cases end in discharge  this article exposes the increasingly prevalent phenomenon of debtors paying nothing in attorneys  fees to file chapter 13  new data from the consumer bankruptcy project  our original empirical national study  suggest that these  no money down  consumers are similar to those who use chapter 7  however  because they cannot afford to pay their attorneys up front  these  no money down  bankruptcy debtors suffer  they pay  2 000 more and have their cases dismissed at a rate eighteen times higher than if they had filed chapter 7  the two most significant predictors of whether a consumer files a  no money down  bankruptcy are the consumer s place of residence and race  we could not identify legitimate ways that these factors correlate with debtors  needs for the substantive legal benefits of chapter 13   no money down  bankruptcy can be a distortion in the delivery of legal help  we suggest reforms to how attorneys collect fees from consumer debtors that will reduce the potential conflict between clients  interests and attorneys  interests  the reforms will deliver access to justice and improve the functioning of the bankruptcy system

  on the perimeter of the lawful   enduring illegality in the irish family planning movement  1972 1985 1 between 1935 and 1985  irish law criminalized the sale and importation of condoms  activists established illegal markets to challenge the law and alleviate its social consequences  they distributed condoms through postal services  shops  stalls  clinics  and machines  though they largely operated in the open  their activities attracted little direct punishment from the state  and they were able to build a stable network of medical and commercial family planning services  we use 30 interviews conducted with former activists to explore this history  in doing so  we also examine the limits of illegality  in describing acts of everyday resistance to law  arguing that the boundaries between legal and illegal  in the discourses and practices of those who sought to challenge the state  were shifting and uncertain  in turn  we revisit illegality   characterizing it as an assemblage of varying selectively performed political practices  shaped by complex choreographies of negotiation between state and non state actors  1 
 12 1 people don t forget    the necessity of legislative guidance in implementing a us right to be forgotten  this note argues that u s  policymakers should use the spirit of the eu s decision in google spain to implement an american right to be forgotten consistent with the u s  constitution in order to regulate the currently unregulated discretion of google and other search engine providers in removing search results  part i outlines the history of the right to be forgotten  the google spain decision  and the emergence of the right around the world  part ii describes the current debate in the united states and discusses the constitutional and philosophical underpinnings that justify a right to be forgotten  part iii applies the spirit and principles discussed in parts i and ii and proposes a substantive and procedural legislative solution to the u s  policy silence on search engine regulation and the right to be forgotten  the proposal in part iii sets forth a multifactor balancing test to clarify delisting criteria  as well as options for an appeals process  with the goal of channeling modern developments of the right to be forgotten into a constitutionally sound regulation  
 so  what should i ask him to prove that he s gay   how sincerity  and not stereotype  should dictate the outcome of an lgb asylum claim in the united states many lgb persons from around the world come to the united states in search of a safe haven from violence and persecution  some of those persons end up in deportation proceedings where they need to prove their sexual orientation before they can be granted asylum  many immigration judges are understanding and receptive to the plights of these persons  however  while adjudicating claims  some judges stereotype and bully these persons with inappropriate questions about their sexual and other histories to adjudicate their claims  since appellate courts have recently thrown out such bizarre and harmful questions and assumptions in religious asylum cases in favor of gauging a claimant s sincerity  this note argues that courts should apply the same deference and standard to lgb claims  this would provide immigration judges a framework to obtain the information necessary for a proper decision  while also maintaining the proper level of respect for lgb asylum seekers  
 the clouds are gathering  developments in taiwanese constitutional law the year 2016 in review in this article  we provide an overview of constitutional law and politics resulting from the historic elections in january 2016 in the historical light of taiwanese political and constitutional development  we take account of the new constitutional landscape opened up by the january elections  the constitutional politics of judicial appointment  the controversies surrounding transitional justice and same sex marriage  and the case law of the taiwan constitutional court  tcc   taken together  we observe that constitutional law and politics in 2016 developed as if it were a multi act constitutional play culminating in the drive towards the legalization of same sex marriage  with president  legislators  judicial nominees  and activists playing the leading roles in the unfolding drama  though the tcc appears to be the bland deuteragonist in the 2016 constitutional play  we suggest that as the issues surrounding various reforms are being translated into constitutional questions  the tcc may well take center stage in the next play  with the upcoming judicial fights in sight  the play of constitutional developments in 2016 may well be entitled  the clouds are gathering   
 the mellow pot smoker  white individualism in marijuana legalization campaigns recreational marijuana is now legal in several states as a result of ballot initiative campaigns  a number of campaigns have framed marijuana legalization using what this note calls  white individualism   they have put forth messages and images to implicitly suggest that white  hardworking  middle class marijuana consumers are deserving beneficiaries of legalized marijuana  this note examines the appearance of white individualism in the colorado  washington  oregon  and alaska campaigns  it also explores the appearance of racial justice appeals in the california  ohio  washington  d c   and massachusetts campaigns  a whitewashed framing of legal marijuana omits and implicitly reinforces marijuana prohibition s troubled legacy  marijuana prohibition first came about through the proliferation of racist stereotypes  its expansion during the  war on drugs  rested on coded racial appeals  and its enforcement has disproportionately affected black and brown people  this note explores the varying degrees to which successful and failed marijuana legalization campaigns have addressed these issues  white individualist framing has tended to correlate with post legalization policies that favor white marijuana entrepreneurs  such as those prohibiting people with marijuana convictions from receiving business licenses  rather than policies that redress harms from prohibition  such as the expungement of criminal records  as many people continue to experience criminalization and racial myths go relatively unchallenged  largely white marijuana entrepreneurs reap legal marijuana s profits  marijuana policy should address past harms  this note argues  because marijuana prohibition was founded and implemented on an unjust basis

 troll check  a proposal for administrative review of patent litigation the patent system is commonly justified as a way to promote social welfare and  more specifically  technological progress  for years  however  there has been concern that patent litigation is undermining  rather than furthering  these goals  particularly in the united states  the time  cost  and complications of patent suits provide openings for opportunistic assertions of infringement  this article proposes a way to address information problems that facilitate opportunistic assertion  an automatic process of administrative review at the threshold of infringement lawsuits in u s  district courts  the results of this review would be non binding but admissible in later court proceedings  whether conducted by an independent patent litigation review board or a division of the u s  patent and trademark office  such review would   1  help discourageor bring to an earlier and less costly end relatively weak patent infringement lawsuits   2  strengthen the litigation and bargaining positions of patentees with especially robust cases   3  flag weaknesses in litigation positions to the benefit of private parties and the courts  and  4  provide policymakers with information that facilitates evaluation and adjustment of patent system performance  this article uses multiple economic models to show the likely benefits of early stage administrative review  nonetheless  because of the fluid and complex nature of the patent litigation landscape  this article proposes that the review process 
 vital state interests  from representative actions for fair labor standards to pooled trusts  class actions  and mdls in the federal courts this article maps the transformation of constitutional understandings of the forms of aggregation that due process permits by putting these expanding views into the context of the changes in the federal docket during the past half century  in the 1940s  jurists interpreting the representative action provisions of the fair labor standards act thought individuals who had not personally agreed to be part of those cases could not be bound by the results  in the 1950s  however  the supreme court approved aggregation to serve the  vital state interest  in protecting banks from large numbers of claims when trust accounts were pooled  and in 1966  rule 23 created a broader mechanism to bind absentees without their affirmative consent or their participation at the inception of a lawsuit  through analyzing unpublished memos by rule 23 drafters  i show how remarkably successful they were in displacing once conventional constitutional wisdom by disentangling autonomy  consent  and individualization in litigation from the strictures of the due process clause  one marker of change comes from data on the related aggregate form of multidistrict litigation  which in 2015 accounted for almost forty percent of the federal courts  docket of pending civil cases  other data mark the need for aggregation  twenty five percent of the civil filings in federal court  and fifty percent of the appeals  are by litigants without lawyers  aggregation provides infusions of resources that are central to enabling litigation  and hence aggregation continues to serve the  vital interest  of the government in need of legitimate court systems to which diverse users have access  
 we don t believe in transitional justice  peace and the politics of legal ideas in colombia this article draws on law and society theories on the circulation of legal ideas to explain the instrumentalization of transitional justice in colombia  most scholarship explains transitional justice as a theoretical framework or as a set of instruments that helps redress mass violence  in contrast  this study reveals that the idea serves as a placeholder for different political actors to promote their respective interests  drawing on over fifty interviews  the study suggests that the power of transitional justice lies in its malleability  which is both its strength and its weakness  as those with different political agendas can appropriate the idea in contradictory ways  the findings emphasize that understanding transitional justice requires a turn from abstract analyses that either take the idea for granted or try to define its meaning toward examining how people on the ground understand the idea  and how they translate those understandings into political action  
  where were your clothes   eliciting descriptions of clothing placement from children alleging sexual abuse in criminal trials and forensic interviews 1 purposethis study examined how children alleging sexual abuse are asked about clothing placement during abusive episodes  both in criminal trials and forensic interviews  the placement of clothing is of great importance  because it facilitates distinguishing abusive touch from non abusive touch  as well as the severity of abuse when the touching is in fact sexual  if clothing has not been removed  then sexual abuse appears less likely and certain types of sexual contact are physically impossible  or at least highly improbable   methodswe examined how trial attorneys  n 142  and forensic interviewers in investigative interviews  n 155  questioned 5  to 12 year olds about the location of clothing during alleged sexual abuse  to do so  we identified all question answer pairs that included references to clothing placement  and coded for the clothing item mentioned  whether the interviewer elicited information about clothing placement or the child spontaneously provided such information  question type  and response type  resultsdiscussions about clothing placement were commonplace in both settings  particularly in court  fewer than one in five question answer pairs about clothing placement were spontaneous mentions by children  the questioner elicited most discussions  when interviewers asked wh  questions rather than yes no and forced choice questions  children provided more elaboration  more detailed clothing information  and were over six times more likely to describe clothing placement in a fashion that could not be captured by a single preposition  e g   neither on nor off   conclusionsthe findings suggest that descriptions of clothing placement are subject to serious misinterpretation when closed ended questions are asked  1 
 21 1  itconference it ad hoc procedure 1 ad hoc procedure   seems like an oxymoron  a traditional model of the civil justice system depicts courts deciding cases using impartial procedures that are defined in advance of specific disputes  this model reflects a process based account of the rule of law in which the process through which laws are made helps to ensure that lawmakers act in the public interest  judgments produced using procedures promulgated in advance of specific disputes are legitimate because they are the product of fair rules of play designed in a manner that is the opposite of ad hoc   para   para actual litigation frequently reveals the inadequacy of procedures created according to this traditional model  to fix the procedural problem s that arise in such cases  litigants  judges  lawyers  and legislatures can design procedure on the fly  changing the   rules of the road   as the case proceeds  ad hoc procedure making allows the civil justice system to function when ordinary procedure fails  but it challenges the rule of law values reflected in the traditional model of procedural design  instead of being created by lawmakers who operate behind a veil of ignorance  ad hoc procedure is made by actors seeking specific outcomes in pending cases  the circumstances in which ad hoc procedure is created raise concerns about lawmakers  motivations  the transaction costs of one off procedural interventions  the wisdom and fairness of those interventions  and the separation of powers   para   para this article introduces the phenomenon of ad hoc procedure and considers its place in a world where much procedure continues to be made through the traditional model  focusing on ad hoc procedural statutes  the article contends that such statutes  legitimacy or lack thereof depends on different factors than ordinary civil procedure  unable to claim legitimacy from the circumstances in which it is crafted  ad hoc procedural legislation must instead derive legitimacy from the need to address a procedural problem and the effort to produce substantively just outcomes    
  brexit  and international insolvency beyond the realm of mutual trust the outcome of the referendum held in the uk in june 2016 is of far reaching and unpredictable consequences  this article focuses on the particular field of international insolvency with a view to identifying some of them  all arising out of the fact that the uk will be leaving the eu area of justice and the strong cooperation based on mutual trust between member states  this will make uk eu insolvency cases clearly less efficient and effective  the consequences of brexit could be mitigated by the already existing coordination among the international instruments dealing with these matters  in particular the european insolvency regulation and the uncitral model law on cross border insolvency  however  not all eu member states have in place rules dealing with these issues as regards to third states  in order to lessen the impact of brexit in this sensitive area of law  the implementation of the model law in order to deal with extra eu crossborder insolvency could be of avail  copyright  c  2017 insol international and john wiley   sons  ltd  
  giving hope to fathers   discursive constructions of families and family law by mckenzie friends associated with fathers  rights groups a mckenzie friend is a lay person who provides assistance to a self representing litigant  srl  in court  traditionally  mckenzie friends have been friends  family members or occasionally charities that have provided assistance free of charge  in england and wales  there is anecdotal evidence that there has been a significant increase in the number of mckenzie friends supporting srls  and  as their numbers have increased  their role has changed  many are now paid  professionals  who offer a range of legal services  these  professional  mckenzie friends usually act in family law matters  and some are associated with fathers  rights groups  frgs   this article analyses the social media presence of mckenzie friends associated with frgs  including how they construct the services they offer and the family law system in which they operate  it shows that many mckenzie friends associated with frgs assert that fathers are victims of gender bias in the family justice system  lawyers are unaffordable  untrustworthy  and excessively adversarial  and only mckenzie friends can produce the outcomes wanted by fathers  while most of their websites support simplistic and decontextualized concepts of  formal equality   other forms of social media  such as facebook sites and blogs  often explicitly construct family law issues in misogynist terms  thus  it is argued that mckenzie friends associated with frgs promote powerful social myths that support gender inequality and violence against women  and deny children s rights  
  in this interregnum   dialectical themes in the critique of criminal justice in this article  we offer a critical examination of the long and rich history of criminal justice scholarship in the pages of social and legal studies  we do so by identifying and exploring a dialectical tension in such scholarship  between the recognition of the role of criminal justice as an instrument of violence  exclusion and control on the one hand and the effort to seek  through or perhaps beyond the critique of criminal justice  an emancipatory project  we explore this tension by examining four areas in scholarship  popular justice  social control and governmentality  gender and sexuality and transitional justice  relating forms of critique to the historical development of a unipolar political world order from the time of the journal s inception  we argue that the criminal justice scholarship in social and legal studies positions it  like the world it describes  in a sort of interregnum   this is a place where the tension between the two poles of emancipation and control is evident but shows few signs of resolution  each of the four themes displays a different critical perspective  one that reflects a different response to living in a world where legal  social and political emancipation struggles against the weight and direction of history  critique nonetheless reflects on criminal justice to reaffirm the need for emancipatory change and consider how it may be achieved  
  interests of justice   defining the scope of prosecutorial discretion in article 53 1  c  and  2  c  of the rome statute of the international criminal court the international criminal court  icc  was established with the aim of prosecuting individuals for the gravest crimes of concern to the international community  yet some provisions of its statute  the rome statute  recognize the need for temporarily setting aside criminal investigations or prosecutions in favour of different considerations  two of these provisions are article 53 1  c  and  2  c  of the statute  they allow the prosecutor of the court to use his or her discretion in deciding not to initiate an investigation or a prosecution in the  interests of justice   nonetheless  the ambiguity of this phrase  coupled with an absent definition  have given rise to a polarized debate about its meaning and the prosecutor s ensuing margin of discretion  some consider matters of peace and security and alternative justice mechanisms as possible  interests of justice   while others exclude them  among those adopting the latter view is the icc s office of the prosecutor  otp   as can be inferred from a 2007 policy paper on the interests of justice and a 2013 policy paper on preliminary examinations  which continue to be upheld by the office  against this backdrop and amid new developments at the icc which call into question the otp s position  the purpose of this article is to develop a comprehensive interpretation of article 53 1  c  and  2  c  of the rome statute  using all the interpretative tools provided by articles 31 to 33 of the vienna convention on the law of treaties  
  no malicious incidents   the concern for stability in china s divorce law practice based on participant observation and in depth interviews with judges  this article demonstrates the significant role of concern for social stability in china s divorce law practice in highly contested and potentially explosive cases  this is evident in the current use of mediation procedures  since the judge is held responsible for keeping the parties in check  the concern for social stability dominates proceedings  the legal criterion of the breakdown of mutual affection  is eclipsed by the political principle of no malicious incidents   this emphasis on maintaining stability  however  paradoxically reproduces social instability because it incentivizes violence in the domestic sphere  it also reinforces gender inequality  this study suggests the need to reflect upon the appropriate role of the judiciary in divorce proceedings and the tenuous boundary between law and politics in contemporary china  
  uniting against impunity  the un general assembly as a catalyst for action at the icc  this article evaluates the role of the un general assembly   unga   and its subsidiary organs in acting as a catalyst for action at the international criminal court   icc    the power of the un security council   unsc   to make a referral to the icc has been increasingly challenged in recent years  due to the perceived misuse of the veto by permanent members and general failings to enforce international criminal law in the face of documented atrocities  meanwhile  the unga and its subsidiary organs have exerted meaningful pressure on the unsc through the creation of commissions of inquiry and country specific resolutions  there is the possibility for the unga to engage in dialogue with the icc through  quasi judicial  resolutions  in coordinating collective responses to a recalcitrant state and individual perpetrators and also through the possible assumption of a referral power  this analysis reveals that the unga has become increasingly active in international justice and holds the potential for an enhanced role in addressing the failings of the current unsc dominated paradigm governing un icc relations  thereby facilitating states in  uniting against impunity   
  wrongful  inheritance  race  disability and sexuality in cramblett v  midwest sperm bank in 2014 jennifer cramblett  a white lesbian  filed a complaint for wrongful birth alleging that the midwest sperm bank mistakenly provided sperm from an african american donor  in this article  we trace the complex and overlapping lines of legal and social inheritance that have conditioned not only the possibility of such a lawsuit  but also the legal language and arguments within the complaint itself  first  we trace the racial politics of homonormativity  which set the conditions of possibility for an out  white lesbian to bring this case forward  second  we trace the inheritance of wrongful birth tort law  reviewing its prior race and disability related uses  and its basis in feminist reproductive rights  third  we trace how disability  race and sexuality interlock within the eugenic inheritance of both  wrongful birth  and reproductive technologies  finally  we follow traces of racial inheritance  namely  the loss of white property and proximity to whiteness  
  mis perceptions of law in consumer markets there are good reasons to believe that consumers  behavior is sometimes influenced by systematic misperceptions of legal norms that govern product quality  consumers might misperceive specific rules  such as those found in food safety regulations  as well as more general standards  such as the unconscionability doctrine or limitations on waivers of default substantive or procedural rights  when demand is affected by systematic misperceptions of legal norms  lawmakers may be able to maximize welfare by deviating from the legal standard that would be optimal in the absence of misperception  we use a formal model to characterize these optimal deviations under different legal regimes  with different types and magnitudes of sanctions   in particular  should the legal standard be adjusted to counteract or confirm the misperception  for instance  if consumers underestimate the level of legal protection is it desirable to raise the legal standard to counteract the misperception  or should lawmakers lower the legal standard to confirm the misperception   
  trans forming single gender services and communal accommodations the right of transgender  trans   persons to access gender segregated space is neither a new controversy nor a conversation which is unique to the united kingdom  yet  despite increasingly charged political debates in north america  the question of trans access to single gender facilities remains largely underexplored by british legal academics  in january 2016  the uk house of commons select committee on women and equalities recommended expanding trans entry into single gender services and communal accommodations under the equality act 2010  using the committee s report as a springboard for debate  this article considers the right of trans populations to use their preferred women only and men only spaces  critically analysing the existing possibilities to exclude trans persons from services and accommodations  as well as the policy arguments which motivate this approach  the article demonstrates how  adopting common sense  evidence based reforms  parliament can introduce legal rules which both prioritize user safety and respect trans dignity  
 a borrowed cloak  the institutional bottlenecks to legislating environmental information disclosure by chinese listed corporations in recent years  the area of environmental information disclosure has been developing as a way for listed corporations in china to adopt the concept of social responsibility  there are views that proposals to legislate corporate social responsibility must depend on existing legal rules of securities and corporate law  however  the foundation of structuring a legal system on environmental information disclosure by listed corporations is essentially incompatible with the legislative aim of securities law  which mainly focuses on protecting investors  as a result  it is hard to coordinate environmental law and securities law to regulate environmental information disclosure of listed corporations  moreover  rules on environmental information disclosure by listed corporations would trigger a clash of institutional goals between stockholder protection and stakeholder protection  creating further tension with existing corporate law  via the principle of fiduciary duty  thus  there are visible institutional barriers to introduce a mandatory environmental information disclosure system for listed corporations via existing securities law and company law  it is not that simple to legislate corporate social responsibility  
 a comprehensive approach to managing threats of violence on a university or college campus horrifying  high profile acts of violence on campuses remain relatively rare  nevertheless  academic administrators are required to manage threats of violence on campus on an increasingly regular basis  these threats take two primary forms  those in which the perpetrator and the intended victim s  are clearly identified  often involving repeated threats and threatening behaviour towards an individual  and those involving anonymous threats to commit acts of larger scale violence  complicating factors in managing these threats include  fear contagion  mass media and social media attention  responsibilities to all members of the university community sometimes including individuals issuing the threat and the intended victims  demands for safety and security measures that are often at odds with professional advice  and permeable campus boundaries that cause security challenges  this paper considers the changing landscape of threat assessment and risk assessment on university and college campuses and suggests opportunities for partnerships between forensic mental health professionals and academic administrators   c  2017 elsevier ltd  all rights reserved  
 a contest for legitimacy  the divestment movement and the fossil fuel industry the divestment movement has sought to influence attitudes to fossil fuels by framing producer companies as pariahs and as unnecessary and redundant  in response  the fossil fuel industry has engaged in a direct and aggressive attack on the divestment movement  this article considers the relationship between the movement and the industry as a contest for legitimacy for both the organizations and the norms they advocate  through a case study of the coal discourse in australia from 2013 to 2016  it explores how each party has attempted to undermine the other s legitimacy and to build or defend its own  it concludes that the contest for legitimacy is complex  being conducted at multiple levels  pragmatic  moral  legal  and cognitive  and before multiple audiences  for the movement to win the contest  it will require more than a simple rebalancing of the legitimacy scales  
 a critical analysis of life imprisonment in malawi the abolition of the mandatory death penalty for murder in malawi has attracted attention to life imprisonment as a possible punishment for capital crimes  this article considers the human rights challenges that life imprisonment in malawi raises in view of the bill of rights and malawi s international obligations under the international covenant on civil and political rights  the african charter on human and peoples  rights  and other international and regional human rights instruments that prescribe various standards for punishment  the article argues that  in the absence of a clear statutory definition of life imprisonment and an inadequate release system  the application of life imprisonment in malawi is inconsistent with the bill of rights and international standards on punishment  
 a critique of the concept nature nexus in joseph raz s methodology joseph raz employs a methodology according to which we can learn truths about the nature of law by examining our concept of law  this article is devoted to interpreting and critiquing this idea  which i call the  concept nature nexus   i propose three interpretations of the concept nature nexus that attempt to make sense of it  and expose the flaws in each  the first employs immodest conceptual analysis and is problematic for that reason  the second i call the  spotlight view   and i argue that it makes sense of the concept nature nexus only by defining the thing in question in a stipulative way that undermines the enterprise  the third relies on the idea that our concepts make the law what it is  i argue that this could make our concepts relevant to understanding law s nature  but would involve prioritising the views of the legal officials with the power to make law what it is  which conflicts with raz s approach  i conclude that  in the absence of some further account of the concept nature nexus  we should abandon it  in closing  i briefly explore methodological possibilities that require only a concept concept or a nature nature nexus  but suggest that these face their own problems  
 a cross cultural analysis of the test of memory malingering among latin american spanish speaking adults cognitive efforts tests  such as the test of memory malingering  tomm  tombaugh  1997   are widely used internationally  yet there is a dearth of research that has assessed the utility of these measures in different cultures  countries  and languages  this study evaluated the specificity of the tomm trial 2 among a sample of 3 590 spanish speaking adults residing in 8 latin american countries  argentina  bolivia  chile  colombia  mexico  paraguay  peru  and puerto rico   trial 2 tomm scores were negatively associated with participants  age and positively associated with level of education  country development  as measured by the united nations human development index  was also positively associated with tomm scores  with the widespread use of cognitive efforts tests  this study offers useful insights into the utility of the tomm in the assessment of spanish speakers and highlights potential cultural biases that may impact test performance  furthermore  this study raises concerns about the cross cultural applicability of the tomm  particularly when using cut scores established and evaluated primarily on north american  english speaking samples  forensic psychologists should be cautious when interpreting tomm performance with spanish speaking adults from latin american countries because it appears that there are cross cultural differences that influence test performance  public significance statement the potential for symptom or deficit exaggeration in the context of forensic evaluations supports the need for reliable and valid measures of cognitive effort  with the widespread use of cognitive effort tests and the potential for cultural biases when tests are adapted to a new language or culture  this study offers useful insights into the utility of one such test  the tomm  in the assessment of spanish speakers in latin america  the present study suggests that forensic psychologists should be cautious when interpreting tomm performance with spanish speaking adults from eight latin american countries because scores varied markedly between countries  and there were significant associations between participants  age  education  and country s development with tomm scores  
 a culture that is hard to defend  extralegal factors in federal death penalty cases empirical research has exposed a troubling pattern of capital punishment in the united states  with extralegal factors such as race  class  and gender strongly correlated with the probability of a death sentence  capital sentencing also shows significant geographic disparities  although existing research tends to be more descriptive than explanatory  this study offers an alternative conception of local legal culture to explain place based variation in the outcomes of federal capital trials  accounting for the level of attorney time and expert resources granted by the federal courts to defend against a death sentence  using frequentist and bayesian methods supplemented with expert interviews we empirically assess the processes determining the total allocation of defense resources in federal death penalty trials at the peak of the federal death penalty between 1998 and 2004  our findings strongly connect extralegal factors to the lowest levels of defense resources  which in turn correlate with a higher risk of a death sentence  far from being idiosyncratic discrepancies  these are systemic and systematic extralegal factors that stand between a defendant and his opportunity to defend against a death sentence  ultimately  we argue for a reconceptualization of extralegal influences and the relationship between local legal culture and capital case outcomes  
 a curtain of gloom is descending on the continent  capitalism  democracy and europe the democratic and social states of the eu  together with other oecd countries  have transformed capitalism  this was also due not only to national but also to the impressive advances of transnational constitutionalism  great parts of the means of production have been socialised or partly socialised  finally  the democratic and social states of europe did not turn to socialism  but became a new formation of democracy with socialist characteristics  and that for the time being was the only formation of modern democracy that ever worked  however  democratic social welfare capitalism has suffered from two problems  secular stagnation and horizontal exclusion  aggressive neoliberalism  politically and theoretically well prepared  took its chance and changed the direction of the evolution of world society  the last 40 years witnessed a great transformation from full fledged market controlling democracy to market conforming post democracy  however  in europe  political alternatives between social and neoliberal models remained open until the establishment of a common currency without legislator and government  which had the unintended effect of excluding all alternatives to neoliberalism once it was established under the rule of competition law that became the substantial  factual  constitution of europe  the global economic crisis of 2008 caused a state of permanent crises in europe  which at present are managed by an ever more exceptional regime of technocrats and experts  it would seem that either democracy comes to an end in europe and in all of its member states or europe becomes the first transnational regime that is not less but more democratic and social than its former member states  
 a decade of private enforcement of intellectual property rights under ipr enforcement directive 2004 48  where do we stand  and where might we go   this article discusses and analyses the ipr enforcement directive  2004 48   it does so in light of its functioning in practice over the past decade  its context and the case law of the court of justice  against the background of the current review of the directive by the commission and its possible amendment  in addition to a number of general issues  particular attention is paid to the rules on evidence and information  injunctions and the involvement of intermediaries  as well as actions for damages and legal costs  it is shown that in many respects the directive is an important legal instrument for the private enforcement of eu law on intellectual property  but also that it gives rise to several controversial issues and complex challenges  
 a defence of the right to litigate in person this review article examines rabeea assy s case against granting litigants a general right to self representation in civil proceedings  assy argues that this right confers no significant value in terms of enforcing litigants  substantive rights  or promoting their personal autonomy or satisfaction  in response  this review questions the limitations that assy consciously imposes on his own analysis  he puts to one side  for instance  the question of litigants  wealth  or their means to hire a lawyer  the focus of his argument is also limited to what he calls  ordinary  civil litigation between individuals  his hope is to pitch the argument as a general contest between values  the effect of these limitations is to lose sight of the context in which self representation takes place  assy s book reveals much about the foundations of the right to self representation  but  when we consider the complications of the law in practice  he discounts too readily the contribution that the right of self representation makes to the continuing legitimacy of the legal system  
 a diachronic approach to bob jones  religious tax exemptions after obergefell in bob jones university v  united states  the supreme court held that an entity may lose its tax exemption if it violates a fundamental public policy  even where religious beliefs demand that violation  in that case  the court held that racial discrimination violated fundamental public policy  could the determination to exclude same sex individuals from marriage or attending a college also be considered a violation of fundamental public policy  there is uncertainty in the answer  in the recent obergefell v  hodges case that legalized same sex marriage  the court asserted that lgbt individuals are entitled to  equal dignity in the eyes of the law   constitutional law scholars  such as laurence tribe  are advocating that faith groups might lose their status  citing that this decision is the dawning of a new era of constitutional doctrine in which fundamental public policy will have a more broad application  regardless of whether obergefell marks a shift in fundamental public policy  that shift will happen at some point  the problem is  under the current diachronic fundamental public policy regime  tax exempt organizations have no way to know  ex ante  what will violate a fundamental public policy  we believe that the purpose of the fundamental public policy requirement is to discourage bad behavior in advance  rather than merely to punish it after it occurs  as a result  we believe that the government should clearly delineate a manner for determining what constitutes a fundamental public policy  we recommend three safe harbor regimes that would allow religiously affiliated tax exempt organizations to know what kinds of discrimination are incompatible with tax exemption  tying the definition offundamental public policy to strict scrutiny  to the civil rights act  or to equal protection allows a tax exempt entity to ensure compliance  ex post  in the end  though  we believe that the flexibility attendant to equal protection  mixed with the nimbleness that the treasury department would enjoy in crafting a blacklist of prohibited discrimination  would provide the best and most effective safe harbor regime  
 a director s duty of loyalty and the relevance of the company s scope of business  cheng wai tao v poon ka man jason the hong kong court of final appeal has utilised a scope of business  inquiry to delineate the boundaries of the no conflict rule for the company director  such an inquiry is directed at discerning the realistic ability of the company to exploit any particular business opportunity and a strict capacity approach is eschewed  at least where the no conflict rule is concerned  the decision is premised on a bifurcation between the no conflict and no profit rules  suggesting that the tests to determine breach of these fiduciary rules are not necessarily the same  thus permitting a more nuanced consideration of directorial breaches  
 a disruptive influence   prevent ing  problems and countering violent extremism policy in practice this article describes how disrupting the activities of suspected violent extremists has become an increasingly significant construct in the policy and practice of the prevent strand of uk counter terrorism  informed by empirical data collected during semi structured interviews with police officers involved in conducting disruptions and members of the communities where these occurred  blended with a limited amount of field observation  the analysis documents how and why a logic of disruption has assumed increasing prominence in counter terrorism work  in respect of police interventions in particular  implementing disruptions  rather than pursuing fully fledged prosecutions  represents a pragmatic way of reconciling increasing demand with limited resources  as well as managing some of the difficulties of translating intelligence into legal evidence  conceptualized in this way  the analysis positions disruption as a distinctive mode of crime prevention  one premised upon logics of near event interdiction  as such  it is understood as rather different in its operations and functions to other forms of  early intervention  that are increasingly prominent in much contemporary crime prevention policy  by focusing upon how specific prevent interventions are implemented and performed this analysis makes a particular contribution to our knowledge of counter terrorism work  this reflects the fact that most previous studies of prevent and other countering violent extremism programs have provided analyses of community perceptions and reactions to policing and the policy frame  rather than the configuration of the interventions themselves  
 a european nevada  bad enforcement as an edge in state competition for incorporations though now possible  no european state is competing for incorporations  and this is unlikely to happen in a general fashion  in this article i argue  however  that the possibility of one state competing for one specific segment of the market for incorporations should not be ruled out altogether  as happened with nevada in the us  a state could seek to attract companies that are looking for a very protective legal environment for their directors  officers and shareholders or for the company itself  given the importance of enforcement  i argue that states could compete by capitalising on the inefficiency of their courts  rather than by changing the law on the books  the fact that no investment is necessary would change the perspective on incentives for states to compete  a very small incentive will be needed if the costs are negligible  i also consider the possible drawbacks of such competition and the possible reactions from other states  
 a fatal case of hypothermia caused by dog bites death from hypothermia usually occurs among people exposed to cold and humid environmental conditions when they are homeless  aged  suffering from natural or psychiatric diseases and drug or alcohol intoxication  a normal healthy person dying from hypothermia due to dog bites is unusual and rare  here  we present a fatal case of hypothermia following dog bites causing blood loss and multiple wounds on the body  a 56 year old man was found dead in a remote roadside puddle of a small village  early in the morning  he was naked  and his body trunk and limbs had multiple irregular wounds  gray animal hairs could be seen in parts of the wound cavities and surrounding areas  in addition  there was a kennel near the scene  family members argued that the deceased was bitten to death by a dog  however  autopsy revealed several findings which were strongly supportive of fatal hypothermia  moreover  we saw no obvious changes caused by blood loss  either on the body surface or internal organs  accordingly  we concluded the true cause of his death was fatal hypothermia  bites from a dog was a necessary causative factor  
 a harmonized european company law  are we there already  to what extent is eu company law harmonized  this article first makes the point that little progress has been made in the direction of company law uniformity within the eu  it then argues that  even leaving aside the question of whether it would be desirable to have a uniform eu company law  that outcome is simply impossible to achieve  due to interest group resistance and the variety in national meta rules  yet it concludes that  in a narrow meaning  european company laws have indeed been harmonized  european member states company laws fit together  which may well be what harmonization  not only etymologically  is all about  
 a historical institutionalist view on merging lulucf and redd plus in a post 2020 climate agreement in the context of the unfccc negotiation process on a global climate agreement  policy makers are looking for approaches on how to significantly raise the mitigation ambition of all relevant sectors  including the land use sector  aside of the formal negotiations some parties to the unfccc have started an informal dialogue and discuss how to merge the fragmented accounting rules for mitigation relevant land use activities  in particular those concerning forest sector emissions  stressing that  history matters   we use a historical institutionalist perspective to assess the institutional pathways of the different accounting rules for developed and developing countries  their mutual relationship  and in how far they are supportive or counterproductive for this endeavour  our empirical analysis shows that parties tend to use any modification phase in the negotiation process to water down already achieved agreements  and that negotiating modalities after targets have been agreed is not conducive either  in the efforts of specifying the paris agreement  merging existing rules into a common accounting framework is likely to further compromise the exisiting weak rules and modalities  and potentially what negotiators consider as  environmental integrity   with this  a formal negotiation of common rules for the accounting of the land use sector may yield an outcome below what has been achieved since the negotiations on a post 2020 agreement started in 2005  we conclude that politically acceptable approaches for the land use sector that also contribute to the overall objective of raising ambition should avoid reopening already agreed decisions on rules and modalities  
 a legal framework for an elderly healthcare platform  a privacy and data protection overview cognitive problems are increasingly affecting the population  with the elderly being the ones most affected  this problem requires a new approach in terms of medical and social actions  personalisation  and services  the ambient assisted living area provides solutions to allow elderly people to stay in their homes safely and with the appropriate care  the number of ambient assisted living projects is increasing rapidly  leading to large commercial deployment  and most of these projects disregard the privacy and data protection of the users and the information that they process and save  the igenda project is a cognitive assistant inserted in the ambient assisted living area that provides help to users in their daily lives  however  since it requires the transfer of a large amount of private and personal data between the modules of the platform  fundamental rights may be at stake  this paper presents the igenda platform  the principle rights of data protection and transmission  legal guarantees and latent ethical concerns  furthermore  the dichotomy between current developments and legal and ethical aspects are explained  to overcome this problem  legal considerations and ethical considerations are presented  embracing appropriate solutions to features that present any threat   c  2017 angelo costa  aliaksandra yelshyna  teresa c  moreira  francisco c p  andrade  vicente julian  paulo novais  published by elsevier ltd  all rights reserved  
 a matter of choice  rethinking legal formalism s account of private law rights ernest weinrib s theory of legal formalism argues that there are two mutually irreducible forms of justice  distributive justice and corrective justice  formalism views private law exclusively through the lens of corrective justice and frames the legal relationship between individuals in terms of correlative rights and duties  this article considers the rights  and duties  of corrective justice with a focus on two principal issues   i  where the rights of corrective justice come from  and  ii  what is wrong with formalism s account of their origin  although kant s doctrine of right serves as the foundation for the rights of corrective justice  formalism in its current form does not provide an adequate explanation of how these rights develop from the moral rights of kant s philosophy  this article attempts to address this disconnect by proposing an account of the transition from moral rights to legal rights  in doing so  it recasts distributive justice and corrective justice as integrated  mutually reinforcing aspects of a unified form of justice based on the principles of kantian right  
 a methodology for determining the  cash economy  in the european union via an announcement effect one of the most important policy considerations currently for all governments across the european union  eu  concerns the need to increase tax revenue so as to reduce their unsustainable budget deficits  one key policy involves reducing the amount of revenue lost as a result of the  cash economy   but before this is possible they first need to have some idea of its size  this study provides evidence of the importance of the cash economy across the eu and suggests that changes in house prices  when the euro was formed in 1999 can be used as a basis to measure its magnitude  these results build on the theoretical model on how individuals who wished to hide their domestic cash from the authorities when the european single currency was formed in 1999  would have needed to acquire a physical asset  most likely property  this implies changes in property prices between the announcement of the euro and its implementation reflect the level of wealth being hidden in this way and therefore the extent of the cash economy  
 a model of constitutional design and corruption the present work proposes a theoretical framework to examine if details in the design of a consensual political system that incorporates proportional representation in the election process are necessary for it to take advantage of an inherent affinity to better accommodate the preferences of the members of a society  it is also examined if these details relate to the introduction of a satisfactory level of accountability for officials and lower levels of corruption

 a new legal treatment for psychopaths  perplexities for legal thinkers public perception  fueled not only by popular and news media but also by expert claims that psychopaths are archetypes of evil incorrigible  remorseless  cold blooded criminals  whose crimes manifest in the most extreme levels of violence  but is there empirical evidence that psychopaths truly are what they are portrayed to be  if so  should the law respond  and adjust its treatment of psychopaths in court   permitting psychopathy to be admitted under an insanity defense and or resulting in mitigation  in this paper  we demonstrate that fundamental questions from the law to science remain unanswered and must be addressed before any alternative treatment of psychopathy can be considered  as it stands  psychopaths cannot be reliably defined or diagnosed and  as we will demonstrate  even the presumed link with criminal dangerousness is problematic  we conclude that the current legal approach should not be modified  however  if preliminary findings regarding impairments in impulsivity self control are confirmed  some  but not all individuals who fall under one definition of psychopathy may merit different treatment in future   c  2017 the authors  published by elsevier ltd  
 a normative approach to the quistclose trust this is the first article to undertake a sustained analysis of normative justifications for the quistclose trust  whilst much of the existing writing on this topic has focused on the better classification of such trusts   for instance  whether they are express  resulting  constructive or sui generis   this article asks why the law should recognise a trust in addition to any underlying legal relationship  four key justifications are addressed  based on respecting party intention  unconscionability  fairness  and the incentivisation of desirable transactions  it will be argued that   i  there are difficulties with each of these justifications  although an intention focused explanation is probably the most convincing  and  ii  the existing law and commentary lacks coherence and consistency  as seen in the mismatch between normative and doctrinal analysis  and the failure to properly address the ramifications of the quistclose trust during insolvency  
 a particularly complex case of matricide by means of plastic bag suffocation  case report a rare case of homicide with plastic bag suffocation is presented in which forensic genetic investigations were carried out on the inner surface of a plastic bag placed over the head of an elderly woman  bedridden after a stroke  the results obtained suggested that she had been murdered and hinted at the perpetrator of the crime  in fact  it emerged that biological traces left by the victim matched those of her principal caregiver  her psychotic daughter  who later confessed to the crime  the old woman also had a son affected by a serious illness  whose genetic profile was found on the same bag  in a later interview  he stated that his sister had tried to kill him too  thus confirming the genetic findings and allowing the investigators to hypothesise that the daughter had used the same means to try to kill him  based on these results  the usefulness of forensic genetic testing when investigating complex plastic bag suffocation deaths is highlighted  this peculiar case deserves interest  since no murder of this kind has ever been reported in the italian forensic literature  
 a particularly serious exception to the categorical approach a noncitizen who has been convicted of a  particularly serious crime  can be deported to a country where there is a greater than fifty percent chance of persecution or death  yet  the board of immigration appeals has not provided a clear test for determining what is a  particularly serious crime   the current test  which combines an examination of the elements with a fact specific inquiry  has led to arbitrary and unpredictable decisions about what types of offenses are  particularly serious   this article argues that the categorical approach for analyzing convictions should be applied to the particularly serious crime determination to promote greater uniformity and provide the predictability necessary to make informed pleas  recent supreme court decisions  as well as a 2015 opinion by the attorney general  support this argument by stressing that the use of the word  convicted  in the immigration and nationality act triggers a categorical analysis  although the united nations high commissioner for refugees has interpreted the particularly serious crime bar as requiring an individualized analysis  this article argues that the categorical approach better protects the high commissioner s underlying concerns of consistency and fairness  
 a reverse mortgage over the family home as a panacea for ageing societies  comparative lessons from japan this article evaluates the rise of the reverse mortgage as a means for senior citizens to convert equity in family homes into retirement income  it explains reverse mortgages in general terms and outlines the risks and potential benefits of this increasingly popular financial product to assess first  whether the product can be successfully regulated  and second  whether the product is desirable from a wider public policy perspective  the article first compares the regulation of reverse mortgages in the uk  the usa  and australia  it outlines three models of regulation  minimalist  interventionist  and procedural  the article then evaluates the regulation of reverse mortgages in japan in its specific legal and economic context  it detects there a recent increase in uptake correlated with a relatively low degree of regulation  it finds that the japanese reverse mortgage market is ripe for the emerging procedural model of financial regulation  but this depends on surmounting significant political and logistical hurdles  the article then examines japanese alternatives to reverse mortgages that may provide a more satisfactory means of providing secure housing and retirement income for senior citizens in japan and other jurisdictions  the article concludes that  in the absence of regulation that genuinely safeguards the interests of consumers  these alternatives are far less risky and are equally compelling from a public policy perspective  
 a review of the legal and regulatory frameworks of nigerian cybercrimes act 2015 as a sequel to the liberalization of the nigerian telecommunication sector in late 1990s  nigeria experienced tremendous growth in telecommunications usage and internet penetration because of the proliferation of internet service providers  isps  and cybercafes  consequently  fraudsters started using the internet  instead of the regular mails and fax to perpetrate crimes on cyberspace  international and domestic reports adjudged nigeria as major global hub of cyber criminal activity  being one of the countries with the highest rates of cybercrime perpetration in the world  the nigerian government became alarmed with the misuse of the cyberspace by the fraudsters and based on the quest to tackle the menace inaugurated in 2003 a presidential committee and subsequent initiatives to investigate the activities of these fraudsters on cyberspace and fashion out a legal and regulatory framework to circumvent the menace of cybercrime  unfortunately  it took the nigerian government over a decade to enact a cybercrime legal and regulatory framework after being exposed to the severe negative implications for national economic development  national security  international relations and also human rights and human security  this paper examines nigeria s legal and regulatory response to cybercrime  it espouses an analysis of the adequacy of the legal and regulatory frameworks in existence to curtail cybercrime in nigeria   c  2017 felix e  eboibi  published by elsevier ltd  all rights reserved  
 a right to know how you ll die  a first amendment challenge to state secrecy statutes regarding lethal injection drugs in the years since 2008  when the supreme court upheld the constitutionality of a commonly used lethal injection protocol in baze v  rees  states have shifted away from the approved protocol and turned towards new drugs  drug protocols  and drug sources to carry out state sponsored executions by lethal injection  even as states have shifted to new  untested protocols and less regulated sources than they used in pre baze years  state legislatures have enacted and amended secrecy statutes that hide information about the drug protocols and sources of lethal injection drugs from the press  the public  and condemned prisoners  meanwhile  a number of recent executions have gone awry  with executions lasting far longer than expected or causing apparent pain in prisoners being executed  state secrecy about execution protocols and drug sources makes it difficult for condemned prisoners to argue about the constitutionality of execution by particular drugs  and prevents the press and the public from evaluating whether lethal injection executions are ethically or constitutionally permissible depending on the drugs being used  and the drugs  quality and quantity   this comment argues that state secrecy statutes concerning lethal injection drugs are unconstitutional because they impose on the public s presumptive right of access to state held information of this sort  the comment explores how the public s right of access derives from the first amendment  and argues that secrecy laws about lethal injection drug sources and protocols impermissibly burden the public s right of access to that information  
 a room with a view  setting influences information disclosure in investigative interviews research on embodied cognition and priming show that human behavior is influenced nonconsciously by the environment in metaphoric ways  previous research has shown that conceptual priming can lead people to disclose sensitive information  davis  soref  villalobos    mikulincer  2016  dawson  hartwig    brimbal  2015   here  we sought to examine whether concepts of openness can be activated to promote disclosure within the interview itself  through the physical setting  in two laboratory studies  participants were exposed to details of a mock environmental terrorism conspiracy through a courier task  which they were subsequently interviewed about in different settings  in study 1  participants were interviewed in either a room designed to activate openness  or a prototypically enclosed  bare custodial interview room  in study 2  we manipulated both architectural and interior features of both rooms  challenging the status quo that a small room is optimal for investigative interviewing  our findings offer compelling evidence that the spaciousness of an interview room can influence a person s tendency to be  open  with or  closed  about information  
 a sociology of legal distinctions  introducing contemporary interpretations of classic socio legal concepts in this introduction to main currents in contemporary sociology of law  i briefly comment on the current state of socio legal studies and sociology of law and reasons leading to this collection of essays  i subsequently focus on some general problems which constantly recur in different socio legal contexts  especially on the sociological critique of legal formalism and the closely related distinctions between internal and external perspectives of law and legal facts and values  discussing these classic distinctions  i argue that they are an intrinsic part of both legal and sociological interpretations of positive law  sociology of law  therefore  cannot resolve theoretical and methodological dilemmas associated with them  yet it can rethink and reformulate them to better understand its own position as a social science of positive law in contemporary society  
 activism and popular constitutionalism in contemporary vietnam based on chinese constitutional analysis  political science  and law and society studies  we argue that work extending the application of popular constitutionalism to authoritarian states applies in vietnam  as popular constitutionalism targets sites relevant to constitutional reform  we contend that popular constitutionalism located in authoritarian states requires three factors  a tradition of activism  space for reformist and pragmatic dialogue targeting constitutional change  and the political need for legitimacy  this article analyses activism in vietnam  focusing on the lodging of petition 72 with the constitutional amendment drafting commission in 2013  and the resulting responses  we conclude that this activism was pivotal in advocating for new constitutional norms  evidencing popular constitutionalism in vietnam  the long history of vietnamese scholar activism  the relative space for governance debates  and the political need for legitimacy made this possible  we also note that popular constitutionalism faces constraints in authoritarian states  which may shape its trajectory  
 addressing the capacity building challenge in the mining sector in rwanda  the implications of rwanda s 2014 mining and quarry law few mining countries face capacity building challenges comparable to rwanda s  worsened by the genocide  a 2009 report put the number of mining scientists in rwanda at 40  fewer than four below the age of 40  the government has however recognized that local skills development is crucial to the potential of mining to contribute to the country s economic development  this has been demonstrated through a series of reforms  culminating in the mining code of 2014  this article considers two issues critical to capacity building in the mining sector  formalization of artisanal and small scale mining and the promotion of local content   procurement  its main thesis is that the code provides limited opportunities for local mining capacity building and its local content provisions are rather nervously worded  this is worsened by the fact that rwanda has no freestanding local content legislation  the article calls for rwanda to adopt such legislation  with specific provisions on local skills training  
 adolescent brain science and juvenile justice policymaking the american legal system s thinking about the criminal culpability of juveniles has been radically transformed over the past 12 years  largely as a result of the introduction of developmental science into the united states supreme court s deliberations about the appropriate sentencing of adolescents who have been convicted of the most serious crimes  the author examines the role that developmental science  and  especially  developmental neuroscience  has played in this policy transformation  after a brief overview of the court s rulings in 4 landmark cases decided between 2005 and 2016  he summarizes the relevant psychological and neurobiological evidence that likely guided the court s rulings  the author concludes with suggestions for future research and policy analysis  including  a  the study of developmental differences between adolescents and adults that have implications for their differential treatment under criminal law  with a particular focus on the neural underpinnings of these differences   b  the study of the impact of variations in juvenile justice policy and practice on outcomes other than recidivism  and  c  the study of the financial costs and benefits of juvenile justice policy alternatives  
 adolescent victims of commercial sexual exploitation versus sexually abused adolescents we have discovered in our clinical review that sexually abused girls have significantly better therapeutic outcomes than girls who have been victims of sex trafficking  thus  we compared the mental health records of 25 adolescent female victims of commercial sexual exploitation with a group of 25 girls with a history of sexual abuse matched for age  exclusion criteria included iq  70  organicity  and psychosis  victims of sexual exploitation were more likely to be in foster care  to have arrests  suspensions from school  and a history of running away  to abuse drugs  to be more impaired in social and school activities  to be withdrawn and depressed  to manifest social and thought problems and aggressive and rule breaking behaviors  and to have a diagnosis of mood or conduct disorder or both  the results of this study suggest that the psychopathology of girl victims of sexual exploitation is markedly different from that of sexually abused girls  
 africa and international humanitarian law  the more things change  the more they stay the same africa  both on the inter state level and the academic level  maintains a very low profile in the global debate on international humanitarian law  ihl   ihl issues do not feature prominently in the armed conflict debate within africa  and african states and people do not significantly participate in the global ihl debate  this contribution is aimed at both identifying the reasons for this lack of regional engagement with ihl and identifying entry points for such engagement  it also ambitiously calls for ongoing and engaged focus on ihl in africa  and to this end  a number of issues for future consideration can be extrapolated from the issues discussed  
 aggressive encounters   white fragility  deconstructing the trope of the angry black woman black women in the united states are the frequent targets of bias filled interactions in which aggressors   1  denigrate black women  and  2  blame those women who elect to challenge the aggressor s acts and the bias that fuels them  this article seeks to raise awareness of these  aggressive encounters  and to challenge a prevailing narrative about black women and anger  it examines the myriad circumstances  both professional and social  in which aggressive encounters occur and the ways in which these encounters expose gender and racial hierarchies  it then explores how the intersectional nature of black women s identities triggers a particularized stereotype or trope of the  angry black woman  and explains how this trope is often invoked in aggressive encounters to deflect attention from the aggressor and to project blame onto the target  after discussing the harmful effects of aggressive encounters and the absence of effective legal mechanisms to address them  the article sets forth tangible steps that individuals can take to minimize their incidence  
 alcohol and violent behavior among football spectators  an empirical assessment of brazilian s criminalization the relationship between alcohol and the violent behavior  expressed as branches of hooliganism  is receiving considerable theoretical attention in social and psychological literature along the past decades while empirical researches on that matter are taken for granted  the falling in appreciate such empirical approach relies on the difficult it requires to compare of two different realities  one with alcohol intake and another without it  in order to evaluate whether it might drive sport spectators into a violent behavior  holding everything else constant  this work provides such robust statistical assessment taking into consideration a brazilian state law 13748 of april 2009  which prohibited the sale of alcoholic beverages in pernambuco s football stadiums  we consider the effectiveness of alcohol intervention on hooligan behavior by means of non parametric test and a autoregressive moving average series  resorting to over ten years of data  before and during the criminalization  with regard aggression and unruly conduct committed by fans before in football matches within 3 miles from the stadium  our results bring support to the decision of pernambuco state legislature to abolish in january 2016 the law in favor of the legalization of alcoholic beverages sales   c  2017 elsevier ltd  all rights reserved

 alien tort statute litigation and transitional justice  bringing the marcos case back to the philippines transnational tort litigation of human rights abuses has generated an extraordinary amount of commentary  yet there is little research on its implications for transitional justice  tj   this article considers some of those implications through a study of a landmark case in which 10 000 philippine victims of torture and other abuses sued ferdinand marcos in us courts under the alien tort statute  analyzing marcos from the perspective of critical approaches to tj reveals that while victim groups used the lawsuit in empowering ways in the philippines  their claims also conflicted with the state s transitional policy seeking economic redistribution  ironically  enforcement difficulties mediated the conflict  leading to the enactment of a law compensating and recognizing a broader range of victims while preserving the redistribution policy  this analysis exposes some of the benefits and risks of transnational tort litigation against foreign state officials  and offers a novel perspective on the enforcement of transnational remedies for human rights violations

 an arbitral solution  a private law alternative to bankruptcy for puerto rico  territories  and sovereign nations puerto rico is excluded from bankruptcy relief under the u s  bankruptcy code  as a result  puerto rico s ability to restructure its debt is severely hindered and almost resulted in a humanitarian crisis in 2016  the problems for puerto rico s government  including a scarcity of interim financing and holdout creditor litigation  exacerbated puerto rico s dire financial situation while draining funds that could have been used to pay creditors  although the recent passage of the puerto rico oversight  management  and economic stability act   promesa   has temporarily capped some of these issues  promesa does not offer full chapter 9 bankruptcy protection and presents issues for puerto rico s long term debt restructuring and its ability to assert a democratic form of government  this lack of bankruptcy protection is also a problem for u s  states and territories that lack direct restructuring relief under chapter 9 or promesa  sovereign nations face similar concerns because there is no international bankruptcy court for nations  this note offers a private law alternative to bankruptcy that could have empowered puerto rico  and other government entities like it  without having to wait on a divided u s  congress or international community to act  by borrowing solutions from chapters 9 and 11 of the u s  bankruptcy code and solutions often proposed in sovereign debt restructuring scholarship  this note creates a private  contractual framework to help puerto rico and other unincorporated territories restructure their debt while working within the boundaries of promesa  this note s proposed framework exports restructuring disputes to arbitration to create mock bankruptcy proceedings for government debtors such as u s  states and territories  although this note concerns puerto rico s restructuring crisis  it also explores the greater applicability of its arbitral framework to other governmental entities that are not afforded bankruptcy protection  such as other u s  territories  u s  states  and nations  
 an assault on the fundamental right to parenthood and birthright citizenship  an equal protection analysis of the recent ban of the matricula consular in texas s birth certificate application policy recent changes in texas s birth certificate application policy have made it nearly impossible for hundreds and perhaps thousand   of undocumented immigrants to obtain birth certificates for their u s  born children  the texas department of state health services  dshs  has implemented a policy banning state registrars from accepting the matricula consular  matricula  as an identifying document applicants may present as part of the state s birth certificate application process  matriculas are consular identification cards issued by mexican consulates to citizens of mexico living outside of the country  they are widely accepted as a reliable form of identification and are often the only identification available to undocumented immigrants  without alternative forms of id  undocumented parents cannot satisfy the policy s identification verification procedure and consequently cannot obtain birth certificates for their children  undocumented parents lacking birth certificates for their children cannot fully access their fundamental right to parenthood  which includes the right to make decisions on how best to raise and care for their children  enrolling a child in schools and daycare and obtaining public benefits like medicaid and section 8 housing assistance all require presentation of that child s birth certificate  in addition  although the children affected by the changes are citizens by virtue of being born in the u s   they cannot fully exercise their rights as citizens  including the right to travel interstate  to receive a public education as well as the right to work  furthermore  the policy may  in some instances  have the effect of denaturalizing u s  born children  thereby depriving them of their statuses as u s  citizens  this note provides an equal protection analysis of section 181  the provision of the texas administrative code that codifies this new policy  part i explains the recent changes in texas  birth certificate application procedures  part ii provides an overview of the equal protection clause  parts iii through v argue that the new texas policy violates the equal protection clause  this note first argues that strict scrutiny is the appropriate standard of review in analyzing the constitutionality of the policy  it then argues that the policy fails to survive strict scrutiny review because it fails to further a compelling state interest  is underinclusive in its attempt to prevent fraud  and because less discriminatory alternatives can as effectively deter identity crimes and fraud

 an economic analysis of the single economic entity doctrine in eu competition law according to well established case law of the european court of justice  ecj   in the european union  eu   parent companies can be fined for antitrust infringements by their subsidiaries  furthermore  under a new eu directive  signed into law on november 26  2014  parent company liability is likely to be extended to private antitrust damages actions  in the united states  u s    in contrast  courts are very reluctant to hold parent companies liable for antitrust infringements by their subsidiaries  whether criminally or in private suits  against this background  i explore in this article whether parent company liability in the antitrust context is justified from an efficiency perspective  i build on works dealing with the economic analysis of antitrust enforcement  corporate torts  vicarious liability  criminal penalties  and limited as well as unlimited shareholder liability to assess the efficiency of parent company liability for antitrust infringements by subsidiaries  based on an analysis of both the legal framework and the economic situation  i explain under what circumstances it is justified to hold parent companies liable and how parent company liability relates to other antitrust enforcement instruments  i conclude with implications for future antitrust enforcement policy  
 an empirical analysis of the public enforcement of securities law in china  finding the missing piece of the puzzle china s public enforcement regime has long been blamed for insufficiently and ineffectively deterring securities crime  we collect data on public enforcement outcomes from documents disclosed by listed firms and find that law enforcement outputs have increased significantly since 2011  thanks to the efforts of the china securities regulatory commission s 38 regional offices  however  due to the lack of a reliable private enforcement regime and the limitations of monetary penalties  the general enforcement of securities law is still regarded as weak  in addition  there exists a salient pattern of selective enforcement  privately owned listed firms face a harsher regulatory environment in terms of both the number and severity of sanctions from regulators  whereas state owned  and particularly central government controlled firms enjoy the most favourable treatment  although the gap has been reduced in recent years  
 an examined life  research into university legal education in the united kingdom and the journal of law and society for academics  the nature of their work means that the socratic demand to live an examined life has a particular force  in this article we look at the extent to which those working in university law schools in england and wales have lived up to this suggestion  in the context of assessing the nature and quality of work on university legal education from the beginnings of university law schools  in doing so  we respond to the comments on such work in the ref 2014 law sub panel report and make some suggestions about likely future developments in the field  
 an indian by any other name  cross border affirmative action while indian tribes bordering the united states and canada may share the same culture  the same ancestry  and even the same name  a descendant of common heritage may not be recognized as  indian  in the united states  and thus not eligible to receive federal benefits  the federal government has the power to recognize an indian tribe s sovereignty and determine who is an  indian  for tribal services  but limits such recognition to those tribes falling within the geographic limits of the united states  with respect to members of  border tribes  that historically traversed the u s  canada border   indian  recognition can be denied to an individual because each federally recognized tribe is subsequently required to limit its membership to those whose lineage can be traced directly to that particular tribe s location within the united states  regardless of tribal heritage predating the border  the result is a gap in recognition  many descendants of border tribes are born and raised on one side of the border but only recognized as  indian  on the other  in the united states  ineligibility for affirmative action both public and private is one symptom of this gap in recognition  this note argues that non recognition of american indians for affirmative action purposes illustrates how the federal government s failure to account for descendants of border tribes prevents the united states from wholly meeting its trust obligation  and proposes ways the government can permanently repair its trust relationship with indian tribes in this narrow context  it discusses three methods for establishing cross border affirmative action for american indians  ratification of a bilateral agreement or enactment of domestic statutory reform within the united states  intertribal recognition of membership between u s  and canadian tribes  and a potential short term solution calling upon private initiatives to embrace a broad cross border definition of  indian   this note concludes that intertribal recognition is impractical due to existing hostility both on the part of tribes and their respective federal trustees to the concept of dual tribal enrollment  further  while private sector mechanisms may provide a stopgap solution to the problem  they cannot adequately address the federal standards that perpetuate the gap in recognition  in order to fully cure this defect and fulfill the government s enduring trust responsibility  congress must take legislative action to close the gap in recognition and provide equal opportunity for affirmative action to all american indians in the united states  
 an invitation to encourage due consideration for the survivability of rescued businesses in the business rescue system of england and wales rescue seeks to preserve the going concern in a financially distressed but potentially viable business  it aims  on one hand  to maximise the value in distressed businesses and  on the other  to give potentially viable but distressed businesses the opportunity of a second chance  in england and wales  the main rescue process is structured to strive for the former but pays relatively little attention to the latter  the mechanisms that have been introduced to maximise the prospects of the achieving a going concern sale have been associated with the subsequent failure of the rescued business  it appears  therefore  that there is a discord between value maximisation and the survivability of rescued businesses  in 2015  the graham review sought to alleviate this discord by proposing the voluntary independent viability report and viability statement  while this article agrees with the reforms to the extent that they encourage due consideration for the future survival of rescued businesses  it argues that the requirements ought to be mandatory and that the buyer should be required to demonstrate that the amount of leverage carried forward and the time span for repayment are calculated with due consideration for the earning capacity of the rescued business and its own operational needs  copyright  c  2017 insol international and john wiley   sons  ltd  
 an uncertain privilege  reexamining the scope and protections of the speech or debate clause the speech or debate clause of the united states constitution was put in place to protect and preserve the independence of the legislative branch  the united states supreme court has consistently read the clause broadly to effectuate this purpose  and it has applied the clause s protections absolutely to ensure that legislators are not questioned by a hostile executive or judiciary in  regard to their legislative activities  in recent years  a circuit split has developed regarding whether the clause provides for a documentary non disclosure privilege  which would shield legislators from subpoenas or search warrants issued by the executive branch and enforced by the judiciary  the ninth and third circuits have rejected such a documentary non disclosure privilege  while the d c  circuit has consistently reaffirmed its commitment to a broad documentary non disclosure privilege  adding further uncertainty to the clause s protections  the ninth circuit has also denied the clause s protections to legislators involved in negotiations about future legislation  in order to provide clarity to the clause s privileges  the supreme court should adopt a limited documentary non disclosure privilege and should apply the clause s protections to non criminal negotiations in anticipation of future legislation  
 analogy  expertise  and experience traditional legal perspectives on analogical reasoning in law posit that legal reasoning involves the initial step of recognizing a similarity between the facts of some previous case and the facts of the instant case  and the recently widespread skeptical views see the claims of analogical reasoning in law as little more than a mask for unacknowledged judicial lawmaking  against both of these views  we argue that analogical reasoning  in law and elsewhere  involves an initial perception of similarity  but a perception that is based on the knowledge  experience  training  and possibly the expertise of the person drawing the analogy  as a result  analogical reasoning in law differs from simple rulemaking or lawmaking  but does embody the categories embedded in the distinctively legal knowledge and experience that lawyers and judges bring to bear on the process of analogical reasoning  
 analysis and reflections protecting fundamental rights in trade agreements between the eu and third countries while human rights and trade are linked in many ways under eu agreements with third countries  fundamental rights as deriving in particular from the charter of fundamental rights of the eu appear as a new issue in eu trade policy  the human rights dimension of trade policy is essentially meant to address the situation in third countries  however  the link between fundamental rights as an internal eu issue and trade has remained weaker  trade agreements do not refer directly to fundamental rights  but contain  exceptions clauses  and references to the  right to regulate   such provisions can be considered as referring  indirectly at least  to fundamental rights  but the issue is whether such an indirect reference is sufficient to cover all fundamental rights related concerns  in particular in the light of the new dimension of eu trade policy  investment protection and the establishment of arbitration mechanisms  the present article looks at how the recent proposals of the european commission have taken this into consideration  
 analysis of concordance between conclusions of forensic psychiatric evaluation and court decisions after 2005 criminal code amendment in a taiwan psychiatric hospital the aim of the study is to explore the relationships between results of forensic psychiatric evaluation on  mental status at the time of the offense  mso   and the final decision of the courts after the amendment of the criminal code in 2005  all criminal cases referred to taipei city psychiatric center for mso evaluation from july i  2006  to december 31  2015  were reviewed  and only the completed trials were included  concordance rates in each category of mso conclusion and the court decision were analyzed and compared  the sample consisted of 366 mso evaluations  overall concordance was 95 6   350 366   the concordance rate in conclusions of  full responsibility    diminished responsibility   and  insanity  were 98 3   177 180   97 7   126 129  and 91 9   34 37  separately  and these three groups showed no statistical significance after compared with the other  conclusions of  intentionally or negligently induced insanity or diminished responsibility  reached the lowest concordance at 65 0   13 20  and compared with the other three groups all showed statistical significance  we found  after the amendment of criminal code  the lowest concordance rate in those conclusions of  insanity  before change seemed diminished  but the conclusions of  intentionally or negligently induced insanity or diminished responsibility  became the major origin leading to discordance  comparing to the previous finding in the same hospital which revealed separate conclusions resulted in statistically significant concordance rates  the effect of the amendment seems likely to improve the consensus among psychiatric experts and trial judges except substance  and alcohol related mental condition   c  2017 elsevier ltd  all rights reserved  
 analysis of evidence in international criminal trials using bayesian belief networks this article demonstrates how different actors in international criminal trials could utilise bayesian networks   bayesnets    which are graphicalmodels of the probabilistic relationships between hypotheses and pieces of evidence  we argue that bayes nets are potentially useful in both the examination of international criminal judgments and the processes of trial preparation and fact finding before international criminal tribunals  with the use of a practical case study based on a completed case from the international criminal tribunal for the former yugoslavia  icty   we illustrate how bayes nets could be used by international criminal tribunals to strengthen judges  confidence in their findings  to assist lawyers in preparing for trial  and to provide a tool for the assessment of international criminal tribunals  factual findings  
 appeal rate and caseload  evidence from civil litigation in korea courts of modern democratic societies have generally implemented appeal procedures to correct potential errors in ruling  however  considering the time and effort that both litigants spend  availability of an appeal cannot be better than reaching the correct judgment in the original case  this difficulty raises the policy issue of how to reduce the rate of appeals and improve welfare of litigants  in this paper  we assert that lower caseloads allow judges to expend more time and effort on each case  contributing to lower appeal rates  analysis of court level data from korea corroborates our inference  
 are integrated impact assessments the way forward for mainstreaming in the european union  this article assesses the utility of impact assessments  ias  as an effective tool for mainstreaming  specifically  it analyses whether the european union s  eu s  system of integrated impact assessments  iias  contributes to the realization of six mainstreaming objectives defined in the eu treaties  the article first studies whether the legal framework for the eu s system of iias makes it a viable tool for mainstreaming  it then proceeds with an empirical analysis of 35 ias to assess the extent to which mainstreaming objectives are taken into account in practice  the analysis shows that all six mainstreaming objectives have a place within the iia system  but the system does not ensure systematic consideration of them  there is considerable variation across mainstreaming agendas  as well as across directorates general  the article concludes that the iia system is no panacea for mainstreaming  and proposes changes to the institutional framework to improve its mainstreaming potential  
 are more prescriptive laws better  transforming redd plus safeguards into national legislation international schemes for financing conservation and climate mitigation  such as reducing emissions from deforestation and degradation and forest enhancement  redd    have generated concerns about the effect of large influxes of money on good governance  the human rights of local land users  and biodiversity  while there is agreement on the need for safeguards to prevent negative effects  how prescriptive or flexible those safeguards should be is not well understood  we develop a framework for a multi scale comparison of the prescriptiveness of measures to reduce carbon emissions with safeguards for community rights and biodiversity  and apply this framework to international redd  safeguards and their transformation into mexican law  our findings reveal significant differences across substantive and procedural safeguards with positive and negative impacts on community rights  we also find that not prescribing ownership over forest carbon and de bundling property rights from rights to benefit from ecosystems stewardship  helped overcome political conflicts in mexico and enhanced the potential for equity in redd  outcomes  
 are oral examinations objective  evidence from the hiring process for judges in greece oral examinations are a fairly common way of evaluating candidates in professional certification settings  this paper explores the objectivity of the process followed for hiring judges in greece  with an emphasis on the effect of gender on the hiring decision  using data for the years 2008 2014  i find statistically significant and robust evidence of female candidates performing slightly worse than male candidates in the oral examination  the mechanism that explains this difference  discrimination  difference in skills  etc   is not clear  nevertheless  this result stresses the importance of applying enhanced meritocratic safeguards to oral examinations  especially when a career as a judge is at stake  
 arguing in good faith about the constitution  ideology  methodology  and reflective equilibrium nearly all of us who participate in constitutional argument in subjective good faith share a second  order methodology of constitutional decision making that is  an approach to working out both our first order theories of constitutional interpretation and our judgments about appropriate results in particular cases  that shared method involves a search for reflective equilibrium between our prior or intuitive methodological assumptions  which sometimes may be vague or indeterminate  and our intuitive judgments concerning the appropriate results in particular cases  if our ex ante methodological theories are underdeterminate  reflection on new cases  facts will lead us to specify our premises more fully  moreover  in instances of initial conflict between judgments of desirable case  specific outcomes and previously adopted methodological commitments  the reflective equilibrium hypothesis advanced in this essay holds that adjustment can occur on either end  if we argue about constitutional issues in good faith  normally we will adapt our judgments concerning correct results to methodological premises that we have previously endorsed  but sometimes reflection on new cases will provoke an elaboration  qualification  or rethinking of methodological commitments  after advancing the reflective equilibrium hypothesis as an explanatory theory of the main currents of constitutional argumentation  this essay offers a brief normative defense

 assessing law enforcement performance in behavior based threat detection tasks involving a concealed weapon or device across 3 experiments  we assessed the ability of law enforcement officers and naive controls to detect the concealment of a weapon or device  study 1 used a classic signal detection paradigm in which participants were asked to assess whether a target was concealing a neutered 9 mm handgun  study 2 involved a compound signal detection paradigm in which participants assessed whether or not 1 of several individuals was concealing an unstable device in their backpack  study 3 moved to a 2 alternative forced choice paradigm in which participants evaluated which of 2 targets was concealing an unstable device in his backpack  across all 3 experiments we consistently found no significant differences in detection performance between law enforcement and naive controls  although participants did perform above chance levels when response bias was free to vary  furthermore  officers  years of experience was associated with a bias toward perceiving concealment  given the frequency with which officers are asked to assess the concealment of weapons or devices  and therein to identify threats  our findings suggest the need for additional research to explore various factors  e g   context  race of target  operational experience  etc   likely related to performance on such tasks  
 assessing the viability of race neutral alternatives in law school admissions over the past several years  law schools have experienced many challenges stemming from declines in student enrollment due to a shrinking applicant pool  the declining number of applicants is particularly problematic for law schools seeking to educate students in racially diverse learning environments  in light of recent challenges to the constitutionality of race conscious affirmative action and the likelihood that president donald trump will make several appointments to the supreme court thereby shifting its balance toward the ideology of colorblindness it is imperative to engage in a project that examines the relationship between racial categories and race neutral identity factors in law school admissions  understanding the relationship between racial groups and certain race neutral identity factors will help law schools comply with fisher i s mandate that universities consider race neutral means for achieving diversity before using race as a factor in their admissions processes  understanding this relationship will also be useful for higher education institutions seeking to enroll racially diverse student bodies in jurisdictions that do not permit the consideration of race in admissions  and may become necessary for all institutions if the court overrules the fisher and grutter decisions  moreover  the data from this study illuminates persisting structural inequalities for certain racial minority groups and rebuts the assumption that those privileged enough to make it to law school are insulated from the structural inequalities that race conscious affirmative action historically sought to address  this empirical study surveyed first year law students at public american bar association approved law schools and asked them about race neutral aspects of their identity  such as family background and educational institution characteristics  to determine whether there is a relationship between their race and certain socioeconomic identity factors  the findings will enhance law schools  understanding of race neutral admissions factors that may contribute to their abilities to assemble racially diverse student bodies  and will give them tools to experiment with trying to yield racially diverse classes without asking applicants about their race  possessing such knowledge will greatly aid law schools as they develop and implement admissions policies in their efforts to provide greater access to students from backgrounds underrepresented in the legal profession while also fulfilling their commitment to educate all law students in a diverse learning environment

 attitude and the normativity of law though legal positivism remains popular  hla hart s version has fallen somewhat by the wayside  this is because  according to many  the central task of a theory of law is to explain the so called  normativity of law   hart s theory  it is thought  is not up to the task  some have suggested modifying the theory accordingly  this paper argues that both hart s theory and the normativity of law have been misunderstood  first  a popular modification of hart s theory is considered and rejected  it stems from a misunderstanding of hart and his project  second  a new understanding of the mysterious but often mentioned  normativity of law  is presented  once we have dispelled some misunderstandings of hart s view and clarified the sense in which law is supposed to be normative  we see that hart s view  unmodified  is well suited to the task of explaining law s normativity

 balancing autonomy and protection  a qualitative analysis of court hearings dealing with protective measures respect for individual autonomy is at the core of the convention on the rights of persons with disabilities  crpd   however  the need to protect persons with disabilities  especially those with cognitive impairments and psychosocial conditions  from outright exploitation  violence and abuse is explicitly provided for in article 16  legal authorities still decide on a daily basis upon the institution of measures  which aim to protect vulnerable persons and unavoidably impact on the autonomy of persons concerned  known as guardianship  curatorship or administration  observations of court hearings  interviews with judges and analysis of written materials from the cantons of geneva and vaud in switzerland as well as from belgium   which all have differently composed authorities   were carried out in order to identify what influences authorities in decision making processes regarding protective measures  and to explore how autonomy and protection can be balanced  we suggest pragmatic considerations that should not be ignored when trying to reach a balance between autonomy and protection from abuse  in line with the crpd   c  2017 elsevier ltd  all rights reserved  
 balancing efficacy with policy space  the treatment of public services in eu trade agreements the tensions created by public services in international trade agreements continue to stir academic interest while remaining highly controversial  this is attributable to their incongruent aims that require careful balancing  taking the european union s  eu   second generation  trade agreements as its focus  this article examines the extent to which such agreements balance the efficacy of their core trade disciplines with space for public service provision  the agreements are examined in three respects   i  exclusions to overarching scope   ii  options for limiting the application of core disciplines  and  iii  the availability of exceptions  this article s primary aim is to determine how the eu balances the efficacy of its trade disciplines with space for the provision of public services  this remains largely unexplored in current academic discourse and has assumed importance given the eu s ongoing trade negotiations  
 balfour v balfour and the separation of contract and promise in 1919  balfour v balfour gave birth to the intention to create legal relations doctrine in contract law  in a dispute between a husband and wife  lord justice atkin said that domestic commitments were not within the jurisdiction of contract law  it has had profound implications for how contract cases are decided  and how contract law is understood  in this paper  i focus on the radical implications of this doctrine for contract theory  charles fried said famously that contracts are promises  but if contracts are promises  why is it that contract law requires not only promise  but after balfour a further intention  that the promise be legally enforceable  that tension between the promise theory of contract and the intention to create legal relations doctrine has led some to doubt the place of promise in contract  dori kimel  for example  says that the doctrine is a portal between the realm of promise  where people are attached  and the realm of contract  where detachment prevails  but such dichotomies are misleading  contract is not separate from promise  it is one of the ways that promise fulfils its function of giving meaning and shape to human relationships  
 bankruptcy s quiet revolution over the last few years  reorganization practice has undergone a massive change  a new device the restructuring support agreement has transformed chapter 11 negotiations  this puts reorganization law at a crossroads  chapter 11 s commitment to a nonmarket restructuring with a rigid priority system requires bankruptcy judges to police bargaining in bankruptcy  but the bankruptcy code gives them relatively little explicit guidance about how they should adjust when a new practice alters the bargaining environment  this essay shows that long established principles of bankruptcy should lead judges to focus not on how these agreements affect what each party receives  but rather on how they can interfere with the flow of information needed to apply chapter 11 s substantive rules  
 bankrupting higher education many institutions of higher education are struggling financially and would benefit from the use of bankruptcy reorganization tools designed to enable struggling enterprises to restore themselves to a state of financial viability  this essential set of tools for responding to financial distress is available only in bankruptcy reorganizations and congress has effectively precluded colleges and universities from having access to them  this article argues that this is a mistake and is premised upon an outdated and unsupported premise  it contributes to the nascent literature on higher education bankruptcy proceedings by examining how differences among the three primary organizational structures of institutions of higher education affect whether and under what circumstances institutions of higher education should be allowed to reorganize through bankruptcy  this article argues that the profound differences in how colleges are organized greatly affect whether bankruptcy reorganization is appropriate for each type of institution  it concludes that for profit colleges are most likely to benefit from access to bankruptcy reorganization  public colleges would likely benefit least from having bankruptcy reorganization available  and the myriad far reaching benefits of granting all institutions of higher education the right to reorganize under the bankruptcy law far outweighs any potential risks  
 bayesian inference for interpretation of polygraph results in the courtroom the psychophysiological detection of deception  or  polygraph  test as it is commonly known  is often used in screening of applicants for employment in security or information sensitive positions  in law enforcement  and in the courtroom  in the courtroom  the primary use of the polygraph is by the criminal defence team to bolster belief in the innocence of the defendant  in publications and in testimony  professional polygraphers present polygraph  accuracy  as some combination of sensitivity and specificity  they rarely describe the positive and negative predictive value of the test  ppv and npv  respectively  or place confidence limits on estimates for these measures  thus  courts and juries are confronted with the difficult problem of assessing the evidentiary value of the polygraph as compared to other evidence  despite more than 80 years of field use  there is very limited data that may be applied to assess the diagnostic utility of the polygraph for purposes of establishing the innocence of a defendant  in this article  we present a fully bayesian analysis of what is probably the largest and most realistic existing data set and we obtain the posterior distribution for the ppv the probability of guilt conditioned on  failing  the polygraph  and the npv  the probability of innocence conditioned on  passing  the polygraph   we show that these quantities have a high degree of uncertainty that is often unexpressed when just point estimates are given  this information may be of value to courts and juries weighing the contribution of polygraph evidence  
 benchmark regulation benchmarks are metrics that are deeply embedded in the financial markets  they are essential to the efficient functioning of the markets and are used in a wide variety of ways from pricing oil to setting interest rates for consumer lending to valuing complex financial instruments  in recent years  benchmarks have also been at the epicenter of numerous  multi year market manipulation scandals  oil traders  for example  deliberately execute trades to drive benchmarks lower artificially  allowing the traders to capitalize on the manipulated benchmarks  this ensures that later trades relying on the benchmarks will be more profitable than they otherwise would have been  such manipulative practices have far reaching and  in some instances  destabilizing effects on the financial markets  in responding to these benchmark manipulation scandals  regulators have relied on the existing anti manipulation framework  which is based solely on ex post prosecution of wrongdoers  the current framework treats benchmark manipulation as just another form of market manipulation  but  as more benchmark manipulation schemes come to light  they cast doubt on the effectiveness of this traditional approach to curbing a modern day form of manipulation  this article provides the first in depth analysis of the differences between benchmark manipulation and traditional forms of market manipulation  this analysis demonstrates that regulators cannot adequately address benchmark manipulation through ex post enforcement actions alone  in failing to recognize how benchmark manipulation differs from traditional manipulation  regulators miss a prime opportunity to oversee a key facet of the financial markets and safeguard market integrity  by focusing on the unique attributes of benchmarks that make them susceptible to manipulation  this article puts forward a comprehensive prescriptive regulatory framework aimed at detecting and minimizing benchmark manipulation  rather than merely punishing wrongdoers after the fact  
 benefit corporations in the united states and community interest companies in the united kingdom  does social enterprise actually work  social enterprise is becoming an increasingly popular and profitable venture in the united states and around the world today  in the united states  the benefit corporation model leads this movement  offering incorporating companies a positive image  a platform to build consumer trust  and the flexibility to pursue social good  however  though the benefit corporation form comes with the aforementioned branding advantages  states  benefit corporation laws as they currently exist generally lack adequate oversight mechanisms  consequently  third parties like b lab play an important role as the primary enforcement entities ensuring that benefit corporations adhere to their stated purposes  the u  s  benefit corporation could gain from a close analysis of the u  k  community interest corporation  as the latter model places greater emphasis on impacts to local community and operates under strict government oversight  simultaneously  u  k  community interest corporations could enhance their efficacy by incorporating benefit corporations  emphasis on global branding  by gaining from the other s strengths  u  s  benefit corporations and u  k  community interest corporations could gain considerable influence  not only as profitable and community centered businesses but also as global leaders in today s growing social enterprise movement  
 bent into security  barrister contribution to a skewed order in two terrorism prosecutions in australia this article explores two terrorism prosecutions   r v  benbrika and ors and r v  elomar and ors to probe how australian lawyers approach the integration of national security interests into the heart of public law  a brief background is provided followed by an analysis of how the security legislation amendment  terrorism  act 2002  cth   as amended  and the national security information  criminal and civil proceedings  act 2004  cth  deviate from the legal order to produce a  skewed blend  between national security and criminal justice  we examine three ways in which barristers contribute to bending of process in counter terrorism trials  accommodation to the precautionary standard  the resetting of equality of arms expectations  and brokered agreements that depend on the deferential relationships within the court  consequently  the moral asymmetry of terrorism is the backdrop for the plausible legality  of  just world  derogations from liberal politics  
 bentham s exposition of common law bentham is a severe critic of common law  denouncing it as  sham law   bentham s denunciation of common law as  sham law  is  however  an evaluative censure  not a descriptive account  a realistic account of the nature of common law can be constructed from his writings  according to this account  first  common law is a collection of authoritative mandates  second  judicial decisions do not evidence common law  on the contrary  judges  through their decisions  create common law by means of legalizing both customs and single actions  common law is not  therefore  immemorial  nor did it originate in the people s consent  third  stare decisis is necessary for common law to fulfil the function of law  but it has no independent value  it is the principle of utility alone that explains  justifies  and decides the use of stare decisis

 between convictions and reconciliations  processing criminal cases in kazakhstani courts the criminal justice system in kazakhstan is full of contradictions  soviet era accusatorial bias in pre trial detention and sentencing goes hand in hand with the pro defendant bias in closing criminal cases  this paradoxical co existence of seemingly contradictory biases fits well within the informal power map of the criminal justice system  the major reform reducing prison population to decrease recidivism and minimize international shaming was coupled with the more recent drives for closing cases on the basis of reconciliation  the total registration of crimes  and zero tolerance approach to combating crime have been achieved only through the change of the incentive structure in the criminal justice system  the post soviet innovation of closing criminal cases of public prosecution based on the reconciliation with the victim of crime has proliferated in kazakhstan because this matched both the incentives of the key actors in the criminal justice system and demands from private actors who are involved in criminal proceedings  in contrast  other types of public participation  such as jury trials  which implement the right to a fair trial  give teeth to adversarial proceedings  and cultivate judicial independence requirements of the constitution of kazakhstan have rarely been used because they disrupt existing power relationships within the law enforcement system  
 between discretion and control  reflections on the institutional position of the commission within the european citizens  initiative process this article considers the institutional position of the commission within the european citizens  initiative  eci  process  with particular emphasis on its decision regarding the admissibility registration of a proposed eci  and its final decision on the outcome of an eci which has met the necessary levels of support  the purpose of this contribution is to juxtapose the case law of the court on the commission s discretion and the relevant provisions of the treaties with the evolution of european integration and  more specifically  the evolution of the commission s role therein  viewed under this prism  the commission s powers at the registration stage  which in any event clearly fall under the scope of judicial review  are compatible with the constitutionalisation of the union  whereas the commission s width of discretion at the follow up stage  while compatible with the commission s prerogatives  cannot easily be reconciled  nonetheless  with the commission s limited legitimacy when compared to that of the co legislators  the fact that it may not always represent the union interest  and the latter s pragmatic losses within the eu institutional balance  
 between law and transnational social movement organizations  stabilizing expectations of global public goods this article draws on niklas luhrnann s theory and method to present transnational social movement organizations as a solution to the problem of increased expectations of global public goods which fail to find adequate accommodation in law  as a concrete example of the limits of law in this respect  it examines the non liquet of the world court on the question of the illegality of nuclear weapons  the trajectory of anti nuclear norms is traced beyond the limits of law to the alternative structure of transnational social movement organizations  and the article presents such organizations as stabilizing increased expectations of global public goods through their recursive decision making and their capacity to continuously project those expectations at the legal and political systems  this generates observations on the concept of  global governance   the structural relations between global civil society and international law  and the role of this form of organization in the evolution of the global political system  
 beyond  best practices   employment discrimination law in the neoliberal era why does u s  legal culture tolerate unprecedented economic inequality even as it valorizes social equality along identity lines  this article takes a significant step toward answering this question by examining the relationship between u s  employment discrimination law and neoliberalism  it shows that the rise of anti discrimination ideals in the late twentieth century was intertwined with the deregulation of labor and with cutbacks in the welfare state  the article argues that even  best practices  to prevent employment discrimination are insufficient to realize a labor market responsive to the needs of low income workers for adequate wages  safe work conditions  and work hours and schedules that allow for fulfilling family and civic lives  the legal scholarship on employment discrimination and the humanities scholarship on neoliberalism are ordinarily siloed  placing these two literatures in conversation shows that the ideals underpinning title vii of the civil rights act of 1964 overlap with the major tenets of neoliberalism  both affirm individual freedom  efficient markets  and judicially enforced negative rights  the conceptual convergence between title vii and neoliberalism enabled employers  business trade associations  courts  and even liberal scholars to interpret the statute in ways that expanded managerial freedom and undermined workers  economic security and control over the terms of their jobs  drawing on novel historical research  this article illustrates how this happened  in the early 1970s  employers litigated under title vii to invalidate state laws regulating the hours and conditions of women s work  today  legal scholars commonly extol the end of these labor standards as marking the genesis of a contemporary prohibition on sex role stereotypes  in actuality  the erosion of state protective labor laws represented the defeat of working class feminists  more capacious vision for sex equality  through the 1970s and 1980s  furthermore  scholars argued that title vii promoted efficient labor markets  this normative justification  however  had the unintended effect of foreclosing claims under the statute that sought not merely opportunity but also the transformation of labor market structures  failure to understand how neoliberalism and title vii jurisprudence intersected historically leaves us blind to the ways in which employment discrimination law may legitimate economic inequality  this has important consequences for contemporary legal theory  dominant antidiscrimination theories centered on antistereotyping and efficiency reinforce the existing terms of the employment relationship and do not serve the needs of working class women and men  this article reveals the limits of antidiscrimination theory to remediate class based subordination  
 beyond earned citizenship for more than a decade  a single rubric for legalization of the 11 million undocumented people in the united states has dominated every major proposal for comprehensive immigration reform  and continues to do so today  earned citizenship  introduced as a rhetorical move intended to distinguish such proposals from amnesty  the earned citizenship frame has shaped the substantive provisions of the legislation by conditioning legalization on the performance of economic  cultural  and civic metrics  in order to regularize status  earned citizenship would require undocumented individuals to demonstrate their ongoing societal contributions at multiple intervals over a probationary period of many years  and they would remain subject to deportation for failure to do so  such a behavioral approach expresses a particular moral basis for legalization and a normative vision of citizenship  and it aspires to place millions of people on a path to citizenship  and yet  despite the centrality of earned citizenship in contemporary immigration debates and the magnitude of its ambition  there has been virtually no scholarly treatment of its substance  ideology  or normative claims  while the election of donald trump has rendered progressive immigration reform improbable in the next several years  this is all the more reason to examine the failed logic and structure of recent reform proposals  this article explores the origins and illuminates the deep structure of earned citizenship  and it critically evaluates its virtues and shortcomings as matters of politics  morality  policy  and law  although laudable for its inclusionary promise  earned citizenship suffers from serious and previously unaddressed theoretical and conceptual flaws that reinscribe the moral claims of restrictionists  illuminate and imperil our larger understandings of citizenship  and invite consideration of alternative frameworks for legalization  the rightward electoral shift has closed a window for progressive reform for now  but when it is next pried open  a different moral and legal framework for legalization may be required  
 beyond safe harbour  secondary trademark liability of online auction sites in china these days  most courts in china tend to immunize online auction sites from secondary trademark liability by putting them directly into a mode known as  safe harbour   a mode similar to that used in tiffany v ebay in the usa   however  safe harbour is criticized for diminishing the incentive for the online auction sites and trademark holders to co operate in dealing with online counterfeit goods  as an exception  in yinian v taobao  the courts moved beyond the safe harbour and sought to strengthen the liability of online auction sites by focusing on the operator s state of mind and the necessity of the anti counterfeit measures  in the sense that the courts were more speculative on the application of safe harbour to the online auction sites  yinian v taobao resembles the eu case of l oreal v ebay  the more demanding line of reasoning in this case seems to be in accordance with the  internet   action plan  which was launched by the chinese government in 2015 to encourage a healthy e commerce environment  however  for practical reasons  until now the line of reasoning in yinian v taobao has not been well accepted in china  moreover  because this case could not be reconciled with contributory infringement theory  it might cause debates about the foundation of secondary trademark liability of online auction sites  
 beyond symbolism  problems and prospects with prosecuting environmental destruction before the icc in september 2016  the international criminal court  icc  prosecutor issued a new policy paper detailing the office of the prosecutor s  otp  priorities for case selection and prioritization  including giving a  particular consideration to prosecuting rome statute crimes that are committed by means of  or that result in  inter alia  the destruction of the environment  the illegal exploitation of natural resources or the illegal dispossession of land   this new commitment of the otp in fighting environmental devastation has been received enthusiastically by civil society and alleged victims  indeed  few would disagree that protecting the environment against harmful conduct and conserving the world s natural resources are some of the most compelling challenges faced by the international community  further  the negative impact of environmental destruction on human rights and peace and security is a matter of concern for many international institutions  including the security council  this article considers the merits and limits of prosecuting environmental destruction before the icc  it contends that the significance and practical implications of the otp s green shift ought to be appreciated against the constraints posed by existing criminal provisions  which have already received attention in the literature  and  more significantly  factual and structural challenges that have been more peripheral in the academic debate  accordingly  the article suggests possible ways to overcome some of these obstacles  the article concludes by reflecting on the necessity to strike a balance between the otp s commendable policy shift  victims  and environmental activists  expectations  and the icc s possible contribution to  environmental justice   
 beyond the  professional project   the political positioning of hong kong lawyers this article examines the factors underlying the political positioning of lawyers in hong kong  it responds to contemporary debates on the sociology of professions by arguing that the  professional project    which sees social status and market monopoly as the profession s primary goals   cannot fully explain lawyers  political behaviour under state society dynamics  hong kong s case is particularly instructive  ethnically chinese  yet practising british common law  hong kong saw its sovereignty shift from britain to china on 1 july 1997  the ideological difference between its two branches of legal professionals barristers and solicitors   has since become more apparent  with reference to cause lawyering  this article highlights the roles of political ideology  the nature of the lawyer client relationship and legal education in shaping the political orientation of lawyers  it offers insight into how hong kong s legal profession must constantly negotiate with a regime that has not traditionally championed the rule of law   c  2017 elsevier ltd  all rights reserved  
 beyond the crisis  the societal effects of the european transformation the european union has been in crisis mode for a decade now  both the global economic and financial crisis of 2009 and  more recently  the so called  refugee crisis  have clearly revealed the serious institutional misalignments of the eu  its absence of intergovernmental solidarity  and the fragility of a european construction that has achieved little more than the creation of a common market  the eu s failure to successfully meet these challenges has led to a serious crisis of confidence  triggering widespread popular distrust of the eu and its institutions and suspiciousness towards politics and political decisions in general  at the same time  and somewhat paradoxically  europeans still express support for the eu  furthermore  there are tangible shows of solidarity between european citizens  thus  contrary to the common assumption  the lack of social integration matters considerably less than institutional misalignment and a failing process of system integration in accounting for the eu s current crises and challenges  thus it seems important to look more closely at the type of social integration involved  given the uncertain institutional supports  the question facing europe today is what kind of trust and affective european attitude and sense of belonging that will sustain over time  
 beyond weber  conceptualizing an alternative ideal type of bureaucracy in developing contexts the study of public administration in developing countries requires that we look beyond the weberian model as the only ideal type of bureaucracy  when we assume that there exists only one gold standard of public administration  all other organizational forms that do not conform to the weberian ideal are dismissed as corrupt or failed  drawing on neo institutional economics  i introduce an alternative ideal type of bureaucracy found in contemporary china  this model  which i call bureau franchising  combines the hierarchical structure of bureaucracy with the high powered incentives of franchising  in this system  public agencies can rightfully claim a share of income earned to finance and reward themselves  like entrepreneurial franchisees  yet distinct from lawless corruption  this self financing  or prebendal  behavior is sanctioned and even deliberately incentivized by state rules  although such a model violates several weberian tenets of good bureaucracy  it harnesses and regulates the high powered incentives of prebendalism to ameliorate budgetary and capacity constraints that are common in developing countries like china  
 birthing injustice  pregnancy as a status offense over the last thirty years  pregnant women  particularly pregnant women of color  have increasingly come under the supervision and control of the criminal justice system  in july 2014  tennessee became the first state in the country to pass a law criminalizing illegal drug use during pregnancy  within weeks of its enactment  several women were arrested and subjected to prosecution under the statute  in alabama  the state supreme court upheld convictions of several women after finding that the state s chemical endangerment statute applied to fetal life  the women convicted of these crimes joined hundreds of other pregnant women arrested for or convicted of similar offenses  indeed  according to recent studies  over 1000 women have been convicted of crimes ranging from child endangerment to second degree murder as a result of conduct during pregnancy  in almost all of these cases  the conduct of the women prosecuted would have been lawful or subject to a lesser penalty had it been committed by a nonpregnant person  this article makes two central claims about the increasing number of criminal prosecutions of pregnant women  first  this article contends that pregnant women are subject to a form of status offense  status offenses  which criminalize the behavior of individuals within a select group of people that would be noncriminal if committed by persons outside of the group  have been utilized to regulate disfavored classes  pregnant women  especially those who are poor and of color  are similarly constructed as a disfavored class and are therefore subject to unique forms of criminal regulation  through the imposition of criminal liability  the state is enforcing gendered norms and policing the line between  good  and  bad  motherhood  as such  criminalization and incarceration play a significant role in the regulation of the reproductive autonomy of women  second  the article asserts that the prosecution of pregnancy based status offenses violates the eighth amendment s ban on cruel and unusual punishment  
 blocking change  facing the drag of status quo fisheries institutions under what conditions can international environmental institutions survive changing power alignments  this article argues that relatively declining powers and private domestic actors play an important role in preserving the status quo because they are eager to retain advantages that existing institutions afford them  this effort to block change affects fisheries negotiations  in particular  by allowing powerful actors to avoid new rules once an institution is in place  i hypothesize  first  that relatively declining fishing powers attempt to retain past institutional successes  while emerging fishing powers seek to alter the status quo  second  negotiating positions reflect not only a country s position in the world  but also the access provided to domestic stakeholders who wish to gain  or fear losses  from new agreements  therefore  i hypothesize that powerful beneficiaries in domestic politics push relatively declining powers to support the status quo when those private actors benefit from highly legalized past agreements and participate in foreign policy decisions  i test these hypotheses by exploring us and eu approaches to fisheries treaty negotiations through archival research and interviews with fisheries negotiators  the evidence supports hypotheses that status quo powers seek to protect earlier deals more intensely when they negotiate with rising fishing powers  and when private parties are most influential  as hypothesized  both governments are particularly protective of the most complex earlier agreements under these conditions  
 bodily integrity  embodiment  and the regulation of parental choice in this article we develop a new model of bodily integrity that we designate embodied integrity   we deploy it to argue that non therapeutic interventions on children should be considered within a decision making framework that prioritizes embodied integrity  this would counter the excessive decision making power that law currently accords to parents  protecting the child s immediate and future interests  focusing on legal responses to genital cutting  we suggest that current legal understandings of bodily integrity are impoverished and problematic  by contrast  adoption of an embodied integrity  model carves out a space for children s rights  while avoiding these negative consequences  we propose that embodied integrity should trump competing values in any best interests assessment where a non therapeutic intervention is requested  drawing on drucilla cornell and joel feinberg s theories we argue that protecting a child s embodied integrity is essential to guarantee his her right to make future embodied choices and become a fully individuated person  
 bounding reasonable doubt  implications for plea bargaining a bound for reasonable doubt is offered based on the cost of type i and type ii errors  the bound increases with the punishment  hence its use as a conviction threshold may leave too many offenders of severe crimes at large  plea bargaining addresses this limitation but introduces strategic interaction between concerned parties  considering strategic interaction between defendants and judge jury  it is shown that to any plea offer there corresponds a unique equilibrium  moreover  all equilibria share the same conviction threshold  given by the reasonable doubt bound  the latter property ensures that the plea bargaining procedure is consistent with the  equality before the law  principle  the former property  that to any plea offer there corresponds a unique equilibrium  bears implications for the design of plea bargain schemes  
 brexit and corporate citizenship the uk s recent vote for brexit has sparked a fierce debate over the implications for the rights of eu citizens living in the uk and uk citizens living in the rest of the eu  so far  however  there has been relatively little discussion of the implications of brexit for legal persons   that is  corporate citizens of the eu  which may also be profoundly affected by consequent changes  the ecj s 1999 decision in centros made clear that the freedom of establishment protects the entitlement of corporate persons formed in one eu member state to carry on their business in another member state  since then  many entrepreneurs in continental european countries have chosen to form companies in the uk  while still carrying on their business in their home country  what will the consequences of brexit be for such companies   
 brexit and parliamentary sovereignty this note addresses the implications of r  miller  v secretary of state for exiting the european union for the legal principle of parliamentary sovereignty  and argues that the strong restatement of the latter is the most significant feature of the decision  the aim here is to show how traditional principle in the dicey tradition has been strongly applied against the competing claims of eu law  the royal prerogative  the referendum and devolution  however  the note also argues that the claims relating to parliamentary sovereignty could have produced a different result and that the most compelling feature of the case was the argument that was not forcefully put by the government  namely that parliament had already provided sufficient authority for the triggering of article 50  
 brexit financial disputes and public international law in the context of the uk s exit from the eu  this article explores the nature of the disputes that may arise in the event of a failure to reach an agreement by the uk and the eu on financial matters  and how these may be resolved in the absence of such an agreement  in particular  this article considers from a public international law perspective whether the uk s international obligations under eu treaties survive the uk s withdrawal from the eu  which actors will have standing to bring a claim  and which dispute settlement bodies might adjudicate such a dispute  
 broken promises  constitutional litigation for free primary education in swaziland swaziland s constitution of 2005 promised that every swazi child would have the right to free primary school education  within three years of the constitution coming into operation  that date having passed  a civil society group took the matter to court  the case initially fared well  but in a subsequent application for performance on the original order  the court balked at making an immediately enforceable order  citing lack of resources as an obstacle  that approach was upheld by the supreme court  this article examines the courts  pronouncements within the swazi constitutional context  it discusses judicial deference  avoidance and pragmatism  swaziland s free primary education judgments are compared with those of courts in south africa  the remedial orders of those courts demonstrate that  although educational goods and services cannot be delivered overnight  creativity and oversight by the courts can ensure that an immediate start is made towards delivering on the constitutional promise

 building norms from the grassroots up  divestment  expressive politics  and climate change the fossil fuel divestment movement is at the forefront of civil society initiatives to raise public consciousness about the need for a fossil free future  through the lens of the social movement literature  this article shows how the movement has harnessed grassroots activists  engaged in innovative and sometimes disruptive forms of protest  and used cognitive framing and symbolic politics to gain media interest and persuade the public of the importance and legitimacy of its claims as well as to promote a new social norm  the relative instrumental  structural  and discursive power of the movement and its adversaries is also examined  showing how  notwithstanding the fossil fuel industry s deeply embedded structural and instrumental power  the movement has managed to shift the contest onto a terrain where it holds a comparative advantage  finally  the movement s role in nonstate climate governance is considered  taking account of its interactions with and impact on a range of other climate actors  this article s conclusion is that climate governance is not only an instrumental or pragmatic process of mandating changes in behavior but an expressive and symbolic one of nurturing a new norm and institutionalizing a new set of moral principles

 caesarean section refusal in the irish courts  health service executive v b in the irish high court case of health service executive v b  it was held that a competent woman could not be forced to have a caesarean section against her will notwithstanding the fact that her refusal increased the risk of injury and death to both her and her unborn child  1 this case is of particular interest since it is the first reported case on caesarean section refusal in ireland  this commentary provides a critical analysis of the judgment  focusing on aspects of the law on informed consent and the way in which the judge reached the conclusion that an order for an enforced caesarean section should not be made  it is argued that  while the outcome can be justified  the reasoning appears at times to be unpersuasive  
 calibrating legal judgments in ordinary life  people who assess other people s judgments typically take into account the other judgments of those they are assessing in order to calibrate the judgment presently being assessed  the restaurant and hotel rating website tripadvisor is exemplary  because it facilitates calibration by providing access to a rater s previous ratings  such information allows a user to see whether a particular rating comes from a rater who is enthusiastic about every place she patronizes  or instead from someone who is incessantly hard to please  and even when less systematized  as in assessing a letter of recommendation or college transcript  calibration by recourse to the decisional history of those whose judgments are being assessed is ubiquitous  yet despite the ubiquity and utility of such calibration  the legal system seems perversely to reject it  appellate courts do not openly adjust their standard of review based on the previous judgments of the judge whose decision they are reviewing  nor do judges in reviewing legislative or administrative decisions  magistrates in evaluating search warrant representations  or jurors in assessing witness perception  in most legal domains  calibration by reference to the prior decisions of the reviewee is invisible  either because it does not exist or because reviewing bodies are unwilling to admit using what they in fact know and employ  assisted by insights from cognitive psychology and philosophy  this article examines law s aversion to overt calibration and explores what this says about the nature of law and legal decision making  
 california water reallocation  where d you get that  when thirsty  californians often avoid going to the market for more water  instead  they might borrow some from their rich neighbors  they might sue them or more commonly  they simply take more from users without much of a voice  e g  the fish or future generations   these alternatives are often superior to using markets  within markets  a surprising detail emerges   it is uncommon for farmers to fallow fields in order to sell water to another user  rather  many water transfers are structured so sellers can have their cake and eat it too  while some of these transfers rightly bring about jealousy and criticism  they likely do facilitate efficient water use  in discussing these points  i provide a more holistic description of how water users reallocate water as well as a richer understanding of how california s water market actually works  
 campus feminisms a conversation with jess lishak  women s officer  university of manchester students  union  2014 2016 drawing from a long history of feminist writing grounded in personal reflection and informal dialogue between feminist thinkers  cobb and godden rasul present an email based conversation with jess lishak  the outgoing women s officer at the university of manchester students  union  2014 2016   the conversation draws on cobb and godden rasul s experience as feminist academics engaged in critical institutional practice through such initiatives as editing the inherently human blog  organising the inspirational women of law exhibition  and participating in university working groups on campus based harassment and violence  in asking lishak to reflect on her journey to feminism and her experiences of activism  the conversation ranges over such issues as personal influences and experiences  strategies for securing institutional support  encouraging student engagement with feminism  and campaigning tactics  the conversation developed out of a  campus feminisms  event in march 2016  which explored the rise of exciting new grassroots single issue campaigns and political mobilisations by students in higher education  and was organised by cobb and godden rasul at newcastle university  uk  undergraduate and postgraduate students shared their personal struggles and achievements in bringing feminist ideas and campaigns to their university campuses  lucy morgan  the gender equality officer at newcastle university students  union  offered inspiring reflections on her efforts to reinvigorate the  f  word  in the face of simultaneous student apathy and backlash  many of these campus based mobilisations have demanded better institutional responses to sexual violence against women  at around the same time  cobb was beginning a new role as the co chair of the university of manchester s first task   finish group on sexual violence and harassment on campus  this followed universities uk s decision to create a taskforce to consider options for improving institutional responses to student safety  in the process  cobb crossed paths with lishak  who had been appointed a member of the uuk taskforce in light of her path breaking students  union work addressing violence against women  since lishak was an exemplar of this new feminist wave in higher education  one that was still inadequately understood by feminist academics despite often working side by side within the same institutions  the authors embarked on this conversation in order to better understand the relationship between academic and student feminist activism on campus  as lishak makes clear in her own reflections  there is nothing inevitable about the synergies between these movements  but there is potentially a great deal that could be achieved through their closer engagement  
 can one  ever  accurately define markets  the ongoing debate about the role of market definition in antitrust cases addresses the usefulness and correct application of the hypothetical monopolist test  hmt  as defined by the u s  department of justice and the federal trade commission in the horizontal merger guidelines  these guidelines intend to identify the techniques that those agencies use to evaluate the potential anticompetitive effects of a merger  in this article  i examine the accuracy of the hmt  in applying the hmt  i consider two separate models  in each model  one knows the true extent of the product market  first  i apply the hmt in a linear differentiated demand model with n firms that each produce one symmetrically differentiated product  and derive conditions whereby m products would be considered to comprise a product market  i find that the test consistently underestimates the number of products in the relevant market in that setting  and the resulting relevant product markets are arbitrary subsets of the actual product market  the second model uses a quasi linear utility specification  where the products enter the utility function additively  the only interaction between the two products occurs through the income effects of the budget constraint  under certain conditions  the smallest possible product market as defined by the hmt must include at least one producer of the other product  therefore  depending on the underlying parameters of the utility function  the hmt might either overestimate or underestimate the size of the relevant product market  sometimes producing purely arbitrary results  
 capitalizing on scientific advances to improve access to and quality of children s mental health care the majority of mental health problems begin in childhood or adolescence  the potential benefits of early identification and treatment of such problems are well established  and models of effective mental health interventions for children have proliferated in recent decades  however  barriers in access to care and challenges in assuring delivery of high quality care significantly limit the public health impact of services for children and families  specifically  the majority of children who need mental health care do not receive it  and when children are in care  many do not receive interventions that are most likely to have the greatest positive impact  a commitment to social justice requires significant improvement in access to care and quality of care to maximize human potential  the purpose of this manuscript is to highlight promising scientific advances in the development of effective mental health services for children and families  as well as the vexing challenges of actually delivering these services to those most in need  key challenges to be discussed include disparities in access to care and quality of care  including race ethnic disparities and complexities of navigating the multi sector mental health service system for children  and difficulties in implementing effective intervention models more consistently in community care  the authors will propose practice and policy reform recommendations to address these challenges  copyright  c  2017 john wiley   sons  ltd  
 careerism and judicial behavior although often criticized by part of legal scholarship  the idea of judicial behavior being influenced by judges  egoistic goals simply needs the appropriate institutional setting in order to be validated  in the present paper  the hypothesis of careerism affecting judges  conduct is investigated with regard to the case of the italian constitutional court  where judges only serve for a limited and non renewable term of 9 years  this institutional framework allows to reasonably assume on a theoretical level the existence of career concerns among them  in order to maximize the chances of future appointments  judges try to earn as much reputation as possible among relevant audiences  empirical evidence supports the theory that career concerns push judges to react to incentives that alter the reputational returns of their conduct  this result holds independently of judges  personal characteristics that might influence their professional concerns

 challenges to an efficient european centralised banking supervision  ssm   single rulebook  joint supervisory teams and split supervisory tasks the establishment of centralized supervision by means of the single supervisory mechanism  ssm  had to ensure the quality and impartiality of banking supervision  as well as the establishment of a supervisory system more properly aligned with the characteristics of the banking sector  the far reaching mixed administration of the european central bank  ecb  and national competent authorities  ncas  must also ensure strong and consistent supervision across the participating member states while using the ncas  local and specific know how  all elements indicate that a more effective banking supervision was necessary for the eurozone  this may be challenging given the conflict between the required centralisation of supervision  on the one hand  and the far reaching mixed administration and composite legal order in place on the other  the first years of experience with the ssm provide a multi faceted picture of the effectiveness of centralised supervision  this paper discusses the effectiveness of centralised supervision within the context of a far reaching mixed administration and legal order on the basis of three different elements  firstly  the basis of supervision is discussed  i e  the applicable substantive laws for which compliance must be ensured by the ecb  and which concerns the so called single rulebook  secondly  the organisation of supervision  in practice  is discussed on the basis of one of its most important features  the joint supervisory teams  lastly  the delineation of supervisory tasks is discussed  as well as its impact on the ecb and  based on the dutch example  its impact on national supervisory models  these elements illustrate the many steps that have been taken to improve the effectiveness of centralised supervision  they also show how many obstacles are still left to overcome  
 challenges to the independence of the international criminal court from the assembly of states parties the assembly of states parties  asp  to the rome statute of the international criminal court   icc  plays a significant role in relation to the icc and  by extension  international criminal justice  non governmental organizations and some states have expressed con em about the potential pr the asp process to unduly influence the exercise of the judicial and prosecutorial functions of the icc  this article uses three examples stemming from recent asp sessions to analyse the asp s potential to influence the work of the prosecutor and the chambers of the icc   1  the asp s legislative function with reference to asp changes to the icc rules   2  the non cooperation of rome statute parties with the icc  and  3  the budget approval process  it argues that the asp risks undermining the icc s judicial and prosecutorial independence  however civil society participation in the asp process  respect for the sub j udice principle  and the development of an ultra vires doctrine could moderate this influence  
 changing fiscal landscape 2008 2017 this article explores some of the key trends and events of the past 10 years and how they influence and shape the business relationships in the industry today  there is no doubt this was a landmark time in our history  the 10 years since the jwelb was first published have been particularly dramatic because of the price shock just getting underway in the mid 2000s  it colored everything and will leave an everlasting mark  but  in many ways it was not unique  it was catalytic  in these 10 years  records were broken  big discoveries were made  technology flourished  fiscal policies were overhauled and now after the tumult there appears to be a hush over the industry as we take stock  
 characteristics of inmates who initiate hunger strikes a hunger strike is a common  expensive  and potentially lethal event within a correctional institution  in this study  we describe the characteristics of inmates who initiated hunger strikes in a state prison system  electronic medical records for a state prison system were reviewed for documentation of hunger strikes from january 2005 through september 2015  there were 292 hunger strikes during the study period  most  71   lasted three or fewer days  when weight data were available  only 12 9 percent of the hunger strikes resulted in a weight loss   10 percent  mental health patients were disproportionately represented in the sample  45    although diagnoses of personality disorders  48   rather than mood  17   or psychotic  10   disorders accounted for most of these cases  nearly 75 percent of inmates who initiated hunger strikes did so while residing in disciplinary housing  in more than 80 percent of the strikes  the reason for stopping the strike was unknown  when the reasons were known  custody intervention rather than mental health intervention was the most common reason for the ending of a strike  improving communication with custody administration and mitigating unnecessarily aversive housing environments are likely to reduce the incidence of hunger strikes  
 chevron in the circuit courts this article presents findings from the most comprehensive empirical study to date on how the federal courts of appeals have applied chevron deference the doctrine under which courts defer to a federal agency s reasonable interpretation of an ambiguous statute that it administers  based on 1 558 agency interpretations the circuit courts reviewed from 2003 through 2013  where they cited chevron   we found that the circuit courts overall upheld 71  of interpretations and applied chevron deference 77  of the time  but there was nearly a twenty five percentage point difference in agency win rates when the circuit courts applied chevron deference than when they did not  among many other findings  our study reveals important differences across circuits  agencies  agency formats  and subject matters as to judicial review of agency statutory interpretations  based on prior empirical studies of judicial deference at the supreme court  however  our findings suggest that there may be a chevron supreme and a chevron regular  whereas chevron may not have much of an effect on agency outcomes at the supreme court  chevron deference seems to matter in the circuit courts  that there is a chevron supreme and a chevron regular may suggest that  in chevron  the supreme court has an effective tool to supervise lower courts  review of agency statutory interpretations  to render chevron more effective in creating uniformity throughout the circuit courts  the supreme court needs to send clearer signals on how courts should apply the deference standard  
 child marriage and family reunification  an analysis under the european convention on human rights of the dutch forced marriage prevention act the dutch forced marriage prevention act aims to prevent family reunification of so called child brides with their husbands in the territory of the netherlands by no longer recognizing child marriages concluded abroad as legal marriages  although it can be argued that the netherlands has an obligation not to recognise a child marriage concluded abroad  it is disputable whether the forced marriage prevention act is in line with other human rights obligations  this article analyses whether the rights of child brides are violated under articles 8 and 3 of the european convention on human rights  if their family reunification application is denied  although the minor spouse is most likely residing outside the territory of the netherlands  a family reunification procedure brings her nevertheless within its jurisdiction  and as such within the sphere of the european convention on human rights  
 childhood immunization  vaccine hesitancy  and provaccination policy in high income countries increasing vaccine hesitancy among parents in high income countries and the resulting drop in early childhood immunization constitute an important public health problem  and raise the issue of what policies might be taken to promote higher rates of vaccination  this article first outlines the background of the problem of increasing vaccine hesitancy  it then explores the pros and cons of 3 types of policy   a  interventions focused on increasing awareness of the benefits of vaccination while eliminating mistaken perceptions of risks   b   nudges   which make certain choices more likely to be voluntarily chosen by manipulating the decision environment  and  c  policies that impose costs to make nonvaccination undesirable even for parents who are hesitant  it argues that a wide range of policies  including coercive policies  is desirable from a public health perspective  as the least intrusive policies alone are unlikely to achieve and sustain the important public good of herd immunity  
 china s bankruptcy law interpretations  translations and commentary following the adoption of the enterprise bankruptcy law in the people s republic of china  prc   effective june 1  2007  rather few bankruptcy cases have been commenced in that country  in part because of judicial uncertainty in how to apply the law in particular cases  in the last four years  the supreme people s court of the people s republic of china   the prc supreme court   has issued two interpretive rulings to assist the courts in applying the law in specific cases  after a summary of the prc bankruptcy law  this article publishes translations of these two interpretive rulings and provides a commentary explaining how they fit in the context of the enterprise bankruptcy law  additionally  the article describes the further interpretations needed from the prc supreme court for applying the provisions of the law that have not yet been addressed  
 china s export restrictions and the limits of wto law in recent years  china has enacted export restrictions on a range of minerals and other raw materials  they include export quotas  export duties  export licenses  and other administrative actions  although such export restrictions have already been found to be inconsistent with china s wto obligations  the practice persists  this article advances an explanation for why this is the case  it argues that the problem lies with the lack of retrospective remedies in wto dispute settlement  consequently  china is able to breach its wto obligations temporarily with minimal consequence  although such restrictions may have negative consequences for upstream extraction firms  china is able to implement the restrictions because several upstream firms are state owned enterprises  as a result  china is able to utilize export restrictions on minerals and other raw materials effectively to foster the development of strategic emerging industries downstream  given existing negotiating standoffs and domestic political constraints  this article suggests that it is unlikely that any potential wto legal reforms will be enacted any time soon to address this problem  
 china s human rights lawyers  advocacy and resistance what do the activities of twenty first century chinese lawyers tell us about the origins and prospects of legal activism under authoritarianism  this essay fits china s human rights lawyers  2014  into an emerging literature on authoritarian legality  the book offers an insider view of a circle of lawyers interested in using china s newly accessible courts as a platform for social activism  it highlights the difficulty of rights lawyers  day to day work against the backdrop of the chinese state s long term experiment in how to harness the power of law without ceding political control  
 choice architecture versus price  comparing the effects of changes in the us student loan market we show that changes in choice architecture have a large effect on student loan decisions while we do not find significant effects of sizeable interest rate changes  we evaluate the effect of two polices implemented in 2010 by the u s  department of education   1  the requirement that all applicants for private student loans fill out a self certification form  which includes various disclosures about federal student aid  and  2  the prohibition of presenting a private student loan as a default option on a financial aid offer without disclosure of the relationship between the school and the creditor  using difference in difference and matching techniques on a proprietary dataset of private student loan originations from the consumer financial protection bureau and survey and administrative data from the department of education  we show that these changes decreased private student loan originations  in contrast  we find no consumer response when analyzing a 60 basis point decrease in the price of federal parental plus loans at some schools  using the same datasets and similar estimation techniques  
 choices of justice  effects of civil war termination on postconflict justice mechanisms implemented by the state in the immediate aftermath of intrastate conflict  states utilize justice mechanisms to address past abuses and to move towards the construction of sustainable peace  however  despite the recognition that justice mechanisms may help facilitate the reconstruction of postconflict states  variance exists regarding which mechanisms states choose to implement  the diversity in choices of justice mechanisms following intrastate conflict raises a central question  under what conditions do states choose retributive and or restorative postconflict justice mechanisms  pcjms   using multinomial logistic regression  we draw upon existing strands of the civil war termination literature  including dual sovereignty   spoilers  and third party intervention  to model pcjm implementation  we find evidence that the form of civil war termination and the presence of a un intervention are strongly correlated with the quantity and type of justice mechanisms employed

 citation practices of the international criminal court  the situation in darfur  sudan this article analyzes the 9 203 citations made by the international criminal court  icc  in its cases involving sudan  to date  few empirical studies have assessed the citation practices of courts and even fewer of international courts  the data is rich  it reveals  for instance  the changing nature of the court s citations over time  the disproportionate distribution of citations among chambers  the potential impact of party pleadings on citations  and the allocation of citations to previous rulings of the court  other international tribunals and domestic courts  the article also explores possible explanations for the patterns that emerge and assesses what the patterns may mean for the court  unlike most other citation analyses  the study provides the additional benefit of having categorized the citations based on their function  distinguishing for instance between citations that the court uses to help it decide legal and factual issues  and those it does not  
 cities  inclusion and exactions cities across the country are adopting mandatory inclusionary zoning  yet  consensus about the appropriate constitutional standard to measure the propriety of mandatory inclusionary zoning has not been fully reached  under one doctrinal lens  inclusionary zoning is a valid land use regulation adopted to ensure a proper balance of housing within the jurisdiction  under another doctrinal lens  challengers seek to characterize inclusionary zoning as an exaction  a discretionary condition subject to a heightened standard of review addressing the specific negative impact caused by an individual project on the supply of affordable housing in a jurisdiction  drawing from the experience of baltimore  maryland s inclusionary zoning ordinance  this article considers the impact that the uncertainty in the law may have had on the type of inclusionary zoning ordinance adopted by the city  this article argues that the conversation about inclusionary zoning  land use regulation  and exactions has been formulated in the context of imagery about development that leaves places like baltimore out  the imagery in these narratives is of an individual landowner powerless in the face of government overreach  the reality is different in those places where land developers are not powerless and instead are often politically influential repeat players  thus  the real problem presented may be not how to craft doctrine to prevent cities from asking too much of developers  but instead to craft doctrine that ensures cities  do not give away too much  
 citizen participation  a critical look at the democratic adequacy of government consultations consultation procedures are used increasingly in the united kingdom and elsewhere  this account looks critically at consultation as presently practised  and suggests that consulters and consultees need to do much more to ensure both the participatory validity and democratic value of such exercises  the possibility of a  right to be consulted  is examined  some ideas from a governmentality perspective are developed  using the growth of localism as an example  to suggest that consultation is often a very structured interaction  the actual operation of participation mechanisms may not always create a space for an equal exchange between official and participant views  examples of best practice in consultation are examined  before consideration is given to recent case law from the uk seeking to establish basic ground rules for how consultations should be organised  finally  the promise of consultation to reinvigorate democracy is evaluated and weighed against the correlative risk of  participatory disempowerment  
 citizenship  community mental health  and the common good in this article  we address the issue of community mental health and the common good via an applied theory of citizenship to support the social inclusion  empowerment  and inclusion of persons diagnosed with psychiatric disorders  we begin by discussing citizenship  and the concept of the common good  in regard to historical conceptions of citizenship  including the historical exclusion of women  people of color  persons with mental illness  and others  we then review the development of our citizenship framework in response to the limitations of even the most innovative community mental health interventions  specifically the practice of mental health outreach to persons who are homeless  we review findings from three citizenship research studies   a community level intervention  an individual  and group level intervention  and development of an individual instrument of citizenship   along with brief comments on current citizenship research  we conclude with a discussion of the challenges of realizing both the individual and collective potential of  and challenges to  the citizenship framework in relation to current and future community mental health systems of care  copyright  c  2017 john wiley   sons  ltd  
 civilizing criminal settlements most cases in the american legal system civil and criminal are resolved by settlement  although settlements are the norm in both systems  the two systems facilitate settlements in very different ways  the criminal system promotes settlements by empowering prosecutors to make the price of going to trial and risking conviction intolerably high for defendants  this leverage enables prosecutors to force defendants to enter into plea bargains under terms largely dictated by the prosecutors  by contrast  instead of providing one party with disparate leverage  the civil system facilitates settlement through procedure  some civil procedures directly encourage settlement  such as rules requiring alternative dispute resolution  other procedures  such as summary judgment  promote settlement indirectly by requiring information exchanges  providing opportunities for neutral arbiters to express their views of the cases  and simultaneously focusing the parties  attention on the material issues  consequently  the civil system seeks to push only the  right  cases to settle and produces more informed and more fair settlements  this article argues that the criminal system should more closely resemble the civil system in the way that it encourages settlements  it identifies several procedures that should be imported into the criminal system to make settlements less the product of coercion and more the result of informed  voluntary bargaining between the parties  in particular  it contends that the criminal system should heighten pleading standards and take seriously motions to dismiss  adopt more liberal discovery  create motions for summary judgment  and allow judicial involvement in plea negotiation  one or more states have adopted several of these reforms to at least some degree  adopting civil like settlement procedures in the criminal system would tend not only to produce more informed and more fair plea bargains  but would also reduce prosecutors  leverage in plea negotiations  this article also suggests discouraging prosecutors from demanding that defendants waive these procedures by adopting some form of fee shifting  which is also borrowed from civil practice  
 claims against third party recipients of trust property this article argues that claims to recover trust property from third parties arise in response to a trustee s duty to preserve identifiable property  and that unjust enrichment is incompatible with such claims  first  unjust enrichment can only assist with the recovery of abstract wealth and so it does not assist in the recovery of specific property  second  it is difficult to identify a convincing justification for introducing unjust enrichment  third  it will work to the detriment of innocent recipients  the article goes on to show how re diplock supports this analysis  by demonstrating that no duty of preservation had been breached and that a proprietary claim should not have been available in that case  the simple conclusion is that claims to recover specific property and claims for unjust enrichment should be seen as mutually exclusive  
 class actions and executive power decisions about class certification and arbitration have depressed private enforcement class actions  reducing deterrence and enforcement of important substantive rights  until now  the consequences of these procedural decisions for the separation of powers have not been well explored  an aggressive supreme court and an inactive congress have increased the importance of federal administrative law for example  administrative attempts to regulate arbitration  moreover  a reduction in private enforcement compounds the importance of public enforcement  state and federal enforcers may piggyback on  successful or unsuccessful  private suits  and they may employ new tactics to maintain deterrence  while proponents of a robust regulatory state may take solace in these executive rejoinders  they are not without costs  specifically  executive action may be less transparent  less durable  and more susceptible to political pressures than its alternatives

 class actions part ii  a respite from the decline in a 2013 article  i explained that the supreme court and federal circuits had cut back significantly on plaintiffs  ability to bring class actions  as i explain in this article  that trend has subsided  first  the supreme court has denied certiorari in several high profile cases  second  the court s most recent class action rulings have been narrow and fact specific  third  the federal circuits have generally rejected defendants  broad interpretations of supreme court precedents and arguments for further restrictions on class certification  one explanation for this new trend is that defendants have been overly aggressive in their arguments  losing credibility and causing courts to push back  another is that courts are retreating from the view that pressure on defendants to settle is itself a reason to curtail class actions  it remains to be seen  however  whether this trend is the new normal  or merely a respite from the decline of class actions  
 clientearth   no 2   a case of three legal dimensions this analysis has two main aims  the first is to explore in some detail the recent decision of the administrative court in clientearth  no 2   here the central focus will be on drawing out three legal dimensions which it is argued played a significant role in the court s judgment  an environmental modelling  an eu law and a domestic judicial review dimension  the second aim is then to offer some reflections on the environmental and judicial review dimensions of the case  here  two main arguments will be developed  firstly  that while clientearth  no 2  does not mark a sea change in the judicial approach to the scrutiny of environmental modelling processes  it does show that the courts are willing to engage in a higher degree of scrutiny when the legislative background requires it  secondly  that there are important insights to be gained  both from an administrative and an environmental law perspective  from reflecting on the role that domestic grounds of judicial review played in the court s legal reasoning this case  
 climate change and sustainability in the energy sector concern with climate change and sustainability emerged in the public debate in the 1970s  over the course of the next 40 years progress was achieved on both fronts  reflecting an evolution in societal values  where economic development was no longer seen as an absolute goal  but one which had to be realized with due regard to its impacts on people and the environment  governments started to consider means to achieve a balance between these competing goals  while companies started to integrate social and environmental considerations in their business pursuits  this article will describe the origins of the concept of sustainability and international attention to climate change and how changes in societal perceptions regarding climate change and societal expectations of company conduct led to increased action by governments and business alike  it will also show how stakeholder activism on the part of the investor community  ngos and governments coupled with companies  endorsement of sustainability as a means to maintain their social licence to operate and hence market position  have resulted in an energy sector prepared to play a part in the transition to a low carbon society  
 clinical decision making  the case against the new casuistry albert jonsen and stephen toulmin have argued that the best way to resolve the complex issues in medical settings is to focus on the actual details of cases and then determine what to do in the given cases  this approach to medical decision making  labeled  casuistry   has met with much criticism  in response  carson strong has attempted to save much of jonsen  and toulmin s version of casuistry  this analysis reveals that strong s recent salvage efforts fail to deflect the major criticisms  the upshot of this analysis is that jonsen  and toulmin s version of casuistry is not an appropriate framework from which to resolve complex issues in clinical settings  
 cohabitation  law reform  and the litigants who sues when cohabiting relationships unwind  before and after reform that extends matrimonial sharing of family property to cohabitants  this article reports findings from the canadian provinces of saskatchewan and british columbia  where reform aimed to divert cohabitants from claims in unjust enrichment  the article reports on a comparison of the litigants in judgments in unjust enrichment pre reform and under the extended family legislation  factors studied include the sexes of the plaintiffs and defendants  distribution of household labour  presence of children  relationship duration  and money awarded  the findings show continuity in the profile of litigants  with relatively few claims from short unions post reform  money awards increased and patterns of household labour diversified somewhat  findings highlight that intensifying the financial consequences of cohabitation may multiply disputes over the nature of unions and their duration  these disputes flag up the unlikelihood of achieving wholly identical treatment for married and unmarried partners  the findings might lead opponents and proponents of law reform to temper their discourse  extending property sharing to cohabitants after a relatively short union  minimum 2 years  did not flood the judicial system  nor did it eliminate procedural and evidentiary hurdles distinctive to cohabitants relative to married spouses  
 collective litigation and the constitutional challenges to decriminalizing homosexuality in singapore this article examines collective legal mobilization through the courts  or collective litigation  in a non liberal regime  it analyses the emergence and development of collective litigation to challenge the constitutionality of section 377a of the penal code  the law that criminalizes same sex sexual conduct in singapore  the analysis focuses on the relational dynamics of collective litigation and legal subjectivities of the social actors involved  highlighting how social positions and strategic interests shaped their interactions and decisions on litigation  while gay rights activists emphasized their movement s collective interests when choosing the appropriate case and lawyers  a movement outsider pursued individual interests on behalf of a client  due to their divergent social positions and strategic interests  the two teams competed with each other as they initiated two separate constitutional challenges  tension between the teams led to conflict with constituents of the gay rights movement and influenced their relational dynamics with other parties  
 combined evaluations of competency to stand trial and mental state at the time of the offense  an overlooked methodological consideration  combined evaluations of competency to stand trial  cst  competency  and mental state at the time of the offense  mso  sanity  frequently co occur  however  most research examines the 2 as discrete constructs without considering 4 potential combined evaluation outcomes  competent sane  incompetentsane  competent insane  and incompetent insane  external validity can be improved if research more closely mirrored practice  it may be incorrect to assume incompetent defendants are similar across cst only and combined evaluations  and insane defendants are similar across mso only and combined evaluations  using a sample of 2 751 combined evaluations  we examined demographic  clinical  offense  evaluation  and psycholegal characteristics associated with evaluators  combined evaluation opinions  multinomial regression analyses revealed older defendants were more likely to be opined incompetent insane  defendants with psychotic disorders were more often opined insane  regardless of competency status  affective diagnoses predicted competent insane opinions  developmental disorders were closely related to incompetence  regardless of sanity status  defendants with organic disorders tended to have global psycholegal impairment  in that they were more often opined incompetent insane  incompetentsane  or competent insane  relative to competent sane  prior hospitalization predicted competent insane relative to competent sane opinions  defendants not under the influence of a substance during the offense or with no prior convictions were more likely to be opined insane  regardless of competency status  we interpret these findings in light of psycholegal theory and provide recommendations for research and practice  collectively  results suggest incorporation of combined evaluations into cst and mso research is an important methodological consideration not to be overlooked

 commotio cordis  a review commotio cordis is an increasingly reported fatal mechano electric syndrome and is the second most common cause of sudden cardiac death in young athletes  it is most commonly associated with a sports related injury  wherein  there is a high velocity impact between a projectile and the precordium  by virtue of this impact  malignant arrhythmias consequently develop leading to the individual s immediate demise  accompanied by a relatively normal post mortem analysis  the importance of an autopsy remains paramount to exclude other causes of sudden death  with increasing awareness and reporting  survival rates are beginning to improve  however  prevention of the development of this condition remains the best approach for survival  
 community justice or ethnojustice  engaging with customary mechanisms to reintegrate ex combatants in somalia the inclusion of customary justice mechanisms is increasingly being invoked as an answer to the top down  externally driven approach to transitional justice  but the practice of engaging with customary justice systems  cjs  proves complicated  the approach of governments and the international community has been criticized as  ethnojustice   where a male elderly version of customary justice is invented and imposed  based on a myth of community consensus  in somalia  the government and international community are currently considering a role for cjs in the reintegration of low risk disengaged al shabaab  as  combatants  this article combines unique data on local perceptions regarding the return of ex combatants in somalia with insights from the literature  to critically examine the prospects of engaging customary justice mechanisms in south central somalia in the reintegration of disengaged as combatants and of a supporting role for the international donor community and the government

 comparative desert vs  fairness in the recent book the geometry of desert  shelly kagan explores  with a rare degree of precision  how best to cash out two fundamental and widely shared intuitions  the first intuition says that virtuous people deserve to be doing well  and that less virtuous  or vicious  people deserve to be doing less well   and thus  that it s good  other things equal  if virtuous people are doing well and if less virtuous  or vicious  people are doing less well  or even badly   the second intuition says that the distribution of the satisfaction of people s desert claims across persons matters  that it s good  other things equal  if people s desert claims are satisfied in accordance with the demands of interpersonal fairness  the former intuition states the basis of what kagan calls  absolute desert   the latter articulates the basis of what he calls  comparative desert   i advance an internal critique of kagan s conception of comparative desert  i argue that it contravenes the demands of interpersonal fairness in the domain of desert  and so fails on its own terms  
 comparative environmental federalism  subsidiarity and central regulation in the united states and china the proper division of responsibility for environmental protection between national and state governments has long been the subject of fierce debate  during the 1970s the united states congress decided to shift the most important environmental responsibilities from state governments to the federal government  the main reason for this decision was to prevent a  race to the bottom  in that states competing for industries could otherwise be lax in implementing and enforcing federal environmental standards  yet  some scholars have argued that there could just as easily be a  race to the top  among states as they compete to attract people and businesses concerned with environmental protection  china  in turn  is plagued with severe air and water pollution and soil contamination  which is attributed largely to ineffective enforcement of its national environmental laws  this article investigates whether china s experience confirms the race to the bottom theory  it demonstrates that devolution of responsibility for environmental protection to lower levels of government tends to result in lax implementation and enforcement of national environmental laws  particularly where national governments also create strong incentives for economic growth  it concludes that china s highly devolved system of environmental governance is consistent with this theory  even if it does not provide conclusive evidence of its correctness  
 comparative law and decolonizing critique this article seeks to reanimate comparative legal scholarship by reorienting it towards decolonizing critique  in his critical assessment of the state of the field  pierre legrand suggests that comparative law has become mired in a solipsistic and outmoded style of positivism  drawing upon theoretical insights from critical theory  legrand argues that comparative law might render itself more generative and more relevant by engaging in a more contextualized analysis of law and encouraging active interpretation beyond descriptive reporting  this article extends legrand s arguments to suggest that an emancipated  incorporative  and interdisciplinary comparative law might play an important role in decolonizing legal scholarship more broadly  founded in a commitment to constrain an ethnocentric impulse in legal discourse  comparative law might be expanded to challenge the varieties of eurocentrism that continue to define legal scholarship and study  while providing hospitable ground for critical and interdisciplinary projects aimed at exploring the colonial roots of both the contemporary nation state system and globalized racial formations  
 comparison  law  and culture  a response to pierre legrand a common method in comparative law is functionalism  legal doctrines and rules are compared in terms of the functions they serve  this method is sometimes in tension with another which explains differences in law by differences in culture  that tension can be reconciled by recognizing that these methods are complementary variants of a teleological approach to law and culture  one that is concerned with the goals  purposes  and ends that the members of a society are trying to achieve  this article responds to pierre legrand s claim that the functionalist method is  positivist   and so blinds one to differences among cultures  he  and like minded thinkers such as jacques derrida  regards each society or culture as a  singularity   if it were utterly singular  however  it would be unintelligible  to understand the differences  as well as the similarities  one must be able to identify some features of a society and discuss them in abstraction from others  the features that chiefly define what we mean by differences in culture  and enable us to understand and appreciate them  are the purposes that the members of a society are pursuing and the ways in which they do so  
 compensation of injuries and homicide in ming and qing law assessment and awarding of compensation to victims of injury and loss are among the main duties performed by courts in many different legal systems  in western law  it constitutes a central purpose of tort law  which in itself is one of the fundamental branches of law  did chinese law have a specific approach to the question of compensation  which singularizes it from other legal systems  from the points of view both of statute law and judicial practice  my primary concern is to investigate whether compensation was granted to victims of injury or death under the ming and qing laws  
 competition and cooperation in international commercial arbitration  the birth of a transnational legal profession this paper revisits the sociology of international commercial arbitration on the basis of unexploited archives and data  this material casts new light on the competition between grand old men and young technocrats in the 1980s and 1990s  a theme that has structured the analysis of international commercial arbitration since the pioneering work of yves dezalay and bryant g  garth  dealing in virtue   in contrast  the data show that the crucial transformative period actually took place between the 1950s and 1970s  when a relatively well defined group of individuals emerged as the leading arbitrators at the international chamber of commerce  these individuals the secant marginalssucceeded in constructing a cooperative interface  rather than competition  between otherwise separate legal systems and professions  in doing so  they created the conditions necessary for the emergence of a new transnational legal profession  at a more general level  the article proposes an alternative narrative of globalization  wherein actors operating at the intersection of various systems  create new arenas of governance on the basis of inter system cooperation  
 competition law and interoperability in cloud computing the cloud computing industry is a swiftly growing sector  with many providers hailing it as a  digital revolution  that will render traditional it business models obsolete within ten years  although still under development  the range of circumstances to engage in monopolistic and anti competitive behaviour in the cloud services market are numerous  suppliers can engage in tying  exclusive dealing  and refusing to share vital information to allow the creation of technically compatible products  monopolistic behaviour and pricing strategies can also restrict innovation and result in a lessening of competition  this paper reviews the european laws that have a direct effect on competition in the cloud computing industry  in addition to competition law  other areas of law have an impact on competition in cloud services  merger regulations for example have a direct effect by controlling market concentrations in the cloud and technology industry  interoperability has emerged as a key policy and legal consideration in cases concerning competition and merger laws  the concept of interoperability has arisen in cloud computing cases  as well as other areas of law that indirectly impact upon openness and competition  these areas include intellectual property and standardisation  as new areas of interest arise that raise enforcement challenges for regulators  the author maintains that current laws are adequate to meet the competition concerns in the diverse cloud services market   c  2017 sylvia song  published by elsevier ltd  all rights reserved  
 competitive effects of international airline cooperation this article analyzes the impact of varying degrees of airline cooperation on nonstop and connecting international traffic using detailed datasets of travel between the united states and other countries from 1998 to 2015  for connecting passengers  we find that antitrust immune alliances  atis  generate fare reductions  relative to interline or simple codeshare itineraries   although these reductions are not significantly larger than those generated by alliances without antitrust immunity  in contrast   metal neutral  joint ventures  jvs  lead to substantially larger fare reductions  similar to those associated with online service in which a single carrier serves the entire connecting itinerary  for nonstop passengers we find that the formation of an ati or jv between two or more airlines serving a route does not generate higher fares  finally  we find that atis and jvs are associated with increased segment traffic and net entry on routes  our results collectively demonstrate that  on the whole  ati grants particularly when coupled with the formation of jvs have been strongly procompetitive  generating lower fares on connecting routes and increased traffic on segments served by multiple alliance partners  with no associated increase in nonstop fares where partner airlines overlap operations  
 compliance with climate change agreements  the constraints of consumption the kyoto protocol required most developed countries collectively to reduce their greenhouse gas  ghg  emissions about 5  below 1990 levels by 2012  despite the binding nature of each country s emissions limitation target  levels of compliance varied greatly  what explains this variation in compliance  this article shows that the amount of material consumption within each country may contribute to answering this question  using cross sectional time series data analysis for 36 annex i  developed  countries from 2000 to 2012 and controlling for a range of domestic and international factors  quantitative analysis shows that compliance with emissions targets is least likely to be realized in countries with higher levels of consumption  this tendency has vitally important implications for agreements on future emissions limitations because those agreements must include more of the large developing countries that are intent on raising their own citizens  consumption toward levels in the developed world  without addressing consumption behaviors and the policy implications thereof  adequately mitigating ghg pollution in the future  notably through the 2015 paris agreement  will be extremely difficult  
 composition in enterprises bankruptcy law of china  crises  reflection and reshaping since the enterprise bankruptcy law of china  hereafter the 2006 ebl  took effect compositions thereunder have faced both academic and practical crises  there may be three reasons for these crises   i  radical transformation of the legislative background   ii  misunderstanding of the purpose of composition  and  iii  its nonconformity with overseas  legislation governing restructuring  the successful market  orientated reform underlying the 2006 ebl has made people change their attitude towards bankruptcy law  they no longer oppose it  the inherent contractual nature of composition implies that its mission should be resolution of disputes with regard to claims and debts arising out of bankruptcy  the legislative developments  however  in jurisdictions  such as japan and germany  show that composition has already been abandoned  composition is not devised to save the distressed enterprises as a newly emerged reorganization as composition is time consuming  costly and inefficient when compared to alternative procedures  such as adr  adr can dramatically enhance the efficiency that debts are paid off  thus providing more funds available to creditors

 conceptions of authority and the anglo american common law divide this article seeks to explain the puzzle of the divergence of american law from the rest of the common law world through the lens of legal theory  i argue that there are four competing ideal type theories of the authority of the common law  reason  practice  custom  and will  the reason view explains the authority of the common law in terms of correspondence to the demands of pure practical reason  the practice view sees the authority of the common law as derived from the expertise of practitioners  especially judges and practice oriented academics  who try to develop the common law as a slowly changing  historically binding tradition  the custom view sees the authority of the common law as derived from its correspondence to contemporaneous norms and values  and the will view sees the authority of the common law  like that of all other law  as derived from the acts of a sovereign  these competing views imply different answers to various questions  such as the relationship between statutes and the common law  or the role of judges in the legal system   they also lead to very different attitudes towards the idea of a single  supranational common law  generally speaking  the first two approaches are more sympathetic to common law convergence than the latter two  i argue that these days english common law is close to the second  practice based conception of common law authority  whereas american law adopts a combination of the third and fourth conceptions  this explains why american common law is largely uninterested in maintaining commonality with other common law jurisdictions  as well as many other differences between american and english common law  
 concepts before percepts  the central place of doctrine in legal scholarship modern legal scholarship often relegates doctrinal work to a lower status tier than empirical research  economic modeling  and philosophical speculation  that move is a big mistake  it is only by knowing how cases fit together with each other and with some overarching theory of social welfare that it is possible to be sensible in applying current doctrine to legal disputes and in formulating alternative approaches  initial theoretical mistakes cannot be cured by their repeated application  which only renders the law more confused and indeterminate than before  the consequences of root error are accordingly examined in three areas  consequential damages  personal jurisdiction  and constitutional standing  basic errors in each of these areas lead to major distortions of legal doctrine  which in turn lead to undesirable social outcomes

 congress blewett by not explicitly making the fair sentencing act of 2010 retroactive in 2013  the sixth circuit court of appeals was the first circuit court to retroactively apply the fair sentencing act of 2010  the fair sentencing act sought to end the discriminatory effects of the anti drug abuse act of 1986 and its treatment of one gram of crack cocaine as the equivalent to one hundred grams of powder cocaine  the fair sentencing act was meant to remedy the injustices brought about by the infamous 100 1 ratio in crack cocaine and powder cocaine minimum sentencing  despite this purpose  the fair sentencing act does not contain language that explicitly and unequivocally requires that the new mandatory minimums be applied retroactively  thus  a narrow reading of the fair sentencing act would mean that individuals sentenced under mandatory minimums that the law acknowledged were  at the very least  perpetuating a racially discriminatory system  would have to serve out those sentences  the sixth circuit in blewett v  united states held that a reading of the fair sentencing act that did not allow for retroactive application of the more lenient and less dubious mandatory minimums created equal protection concerns that mandated reading the text to allow for retroactive application  although the original blewett panel decision has been heavily criticized  vacated  and eventually overturned en bane  this comment argues that the original blewett panel was correct in holding that equal protection requires reading the text of the fair sentencing act to allow for retroactive application  
 congress  statutory interpretation  and the failure of formalism  the cbo canon and other ways that courts can improve on what they are already trying to do the formalist project in statutory interpretation  as it has defined itself  has been a failure  that project typified by but not limited to justice antonin scalia s brand of textualism has been doomed because even its staunchest supporters have been unwilling to carry it out  the rules that judges employ are too numerous to be predictably chosen  there is no ranking among them  they are not treated as black letter  precedential law  even formalist textualist judges  it turns out  crave interpretive flexibility  do not want to be controlled by other courts or congress  and feel the need to show their interpretive actions are democratically linked to congress  what we actually have instead is an approach whose legitimacy depends  in large part  on understanding how congress works  establishing the incomplete execution of formalism is a crucial first step in this argument  because the fiction that textualism has been successful in achieving its goals has prevented us from seeing what judges actually want and  in fact  are actually doing  with that understanding  it becomes clear that better judicial understanding of the realities of congressional drafting practice will not only make statutory interpretation practice more legitimate  but also advance the enterprise of what most judges even formalists already see their job to be  if formalism originally began as a second best alternative to understanding congress  understanding congress has emerged as a second best alternative to carrying out the formalist project  after laying this groundwork  this essay offers ten new rules of statutory interpretation objective  formalism compatible rules  but rules grounded in congressional practice  it especially highlights one new rule the cbo canon and then offers nine more  including an anticonsistency presumption and presumptions about different legislative vehicles  multiple agency delegations  dictionaries  and special legislative history  judges of all interpretive stripes have shown new interest in applying this kind of real world understanding of the legislative process to statutory interpretation doctrine  the goals here are to explore why that might be the case  to meet some of the objections that have been raised about the use of such evidence  and to offer examples to illustrate the very possibility of what might be  and in some cases already is  
 consensus and contestability  the ecthr and the combined potential of european consensus and procedural rationality control this article explores the contestability of european consensus and its significance for the legitimacy of the european court of human rights  ecthr   the ecthr s combined legitimation strategy  comprising european consensus and the new procedural approach to the margin of appreciation  which has been seen in several judgments  opens up space for democratic contestation and deliberation  progressive  rights friendly judgments that consider a mere trend in  vanguard  state parties as european consensus will probably provoke domestic contestation in  laggard  states  this potential backlash can be productive because it can subsequently impart additional legitimation on the ecthr s judgments  procedural rationality control ensures that this avenue of democratic legitimation is kept open and that there are institutional structures and processes to balance human rights adequately in domestic debates  combining consensus based arguments with a procedural approach to the margin of appreciation reconciles the impact of a european consensus and the need for democratic deliberation  high standards in domestic procedures can possibly rebut the presumption in favour of the solution adopted by the majority of convention states  potentially  this approach also allows democratic domestic law making institutions to react to judgments of the ecthr based on european consensus  
 constitutional carve outs most modern constitutions contain a variety of express constitutional  carve outs  that narrow the scope of otherwise general constitutional norms  carve outs of this kind often reflect an attempt by drafters to create a form of constitutional  insurance  for certain preferred legislative policies or increase the likelihood that courts will uphold those policies as valid  the difficulty for drafters  however  is that there are multiple ways in which courts can approach the interaction between carve outs of this kind and general constitutional norms  they can treat carve outs as having purely evidentiary effect  as creating a special safe harbour for favoured forms of legislative action or  equally  as a true exception to general constitutional language  which supports an interpretive approach directly contrary to that intended by drafters  the same pattern applies for specific provisions seeking to broaden or extend the scope of general constitutional norms  thus  while it is often hoped that specific constitutional language will offer greater predictability in constitutional interpretation  this underestimates the complex ways in which courts respond to the interaction between specific and general constitutional provisions  the article makes these arguments by reference to detailed constitutional case studies from india  south africa and australia involving affirmative action  and canada  india and australia on the scope of federal legislative power  
 constitutional pluralism  chronicle of a death foretold  what remains of the idea of constitutional pluralism in the wake of the euro crisis  according to the new anti pluralists  the recent omt saga signals its demise  calling to an end the tense stalemate between the ecj and the german constitutional court on the question of ultimate authority  with the ecj s checkmate  omt represents a new stage in the constitutionalisation of the european union  towards a fully monist order  since constitutional pluralism was an inherently unstable and undesirable compromise  that is both inevitable and to be welcomed  it is argued here that this is misguided in attending to the formal at the expense of the material dimension of constitutional development  the material perspective reveals a deeply dysfunctional constitutional dynamic  of which the judicial battle in omt is merely a surface reflection  this dynamic now reaches a critical conjuncture  encapsulated in the debate over grexit   and the material conflict between solidarity and austerity  constitutional pluralism  in conclusion  may be an idea worth defending  but as a normative plea for the co existence of a horizontal plurality of constitutional orders  this requires radical constitutional re imagination of the european project  
 constitutional statutes in recent years  british courts have treated constitutional statutes differently from ordinary statutes  this article sets outs to explain   i  how courts have treated constitutional statutes differently from ordinary statutes   ii  what a constitutional statute is  and  iii  why constitutional statutes should be treated differently from ordinary statutes  courts have made it harder for ordinary statutes to repeal constitutional statutes by implication  and easier for constitutional statutes to repeal ordinary statutes by implication  a constitutional statute is a statute which regulates state institutions  and which possesses importance of a particular type that we describe  the nature of a constitutional statute largely but not entirely justifies the special treatment they have been given  these conclusions have wider implications  including for proposals to codify the british constitution  
 constitutionalized consent  preemption of state tax limits in municipal bankruptcy many states impose absolute limits on municipal taxes  such as a one percent maximum property tax   states also commonly require electoral approval of municipal taxes  california s proposition 13 is the best known example of such state imposed requirements  such restrictions reduce municipal flexibility in dealing with financial distress and may contribute to municipal financial distress  this article argues that congress may constitutionally preempt such rules in the exercise of its bankruptcy power  preemption of state tax limits in bankruptcy should be found to lie within congress s power under the bankruptcy clause  the clause has been interpreted to provide expansive authority to legislate on the subject of insolvency that is  a person s general inability to pay debts  taxation is intimately bound up with municipal ability to pay debts  indeed  taxation occupies a position in municipal debt collection roughly analogous to that of property in non municipal debt collection  the supreme court s understanding of the scope of the bankruptcy clause has consistently evolved in the direction of finding broader authority under the clause to meet novel conditions  such as the unprecedented potentially impending municipal debt crisis brought on by a squeeze between pension obligations that cannot be changed and taxes that cannot be increased  the most serious objection to the article s thesis may be that preempting state tax limits would violate the tenth amendment  this article argues that the requirement that states consent to their municipalities  bankruptcies cures any tenth amendment problem  perhaps somewhat surprisingly  the power of state consent to municipal bankruptcy is such that it authorizes municipalities to propose bankruptcy plans that would otherwise violate state law  including the state constitution  the landmark decisions in detroit and stockton  which held that municipal bankruptcy trumped state constitutional protections for municipal retirees  are recent and prominent cases that embrace this proposition  just as state constitutional protections for creditors yield to municipal bankruptcy  so too would state constitutional limits on municipal taxes yield to a revised municipal bankruptcy statute that preempted them  
 constructing international crime  lawyers  states  and the origin of international criminal prosecution in the interwar period this article explains the development of international crime as a legal category  i argue that states  pursuit of political rights claims empowers international lawyers to develop new legal categories to grant states new tools to pursue their interests  at the same time  lawyers have a stake in defending the autonomy of law from politics  thus pushing for the development of legal norms and institutions that go beyond the original state intent  states  turn to law thus begets more law  expanding the legal and institutional tools to solve international problems while simultaneously enforcing a commitment to principles of legality  to demonstrate the plausibility of the theory  the article studies the construction of the concept of an international crime in the interwar period  1919 1939   in response to the allies  attempt to prosecute the german emperor  international lawyers sought the codification of international criminal law and drafted enforcement mechanisms  the interwar legal debate not only introduced international crime into the legal and political vocabulary  it also legitimized a new set of institutional responses to violations of international law  namely  international criminal prosecution  
 consumer litigation funding and medical malpractice litigation  examining the effect of rancman v  interim settlement funding corporation consumer litigation funding  a growing industry in the united states  is an alternative credit source for cash strapped tort plaintiffs  financiers give plaintiffs nonrecourse loans that are premised on lawsuit outcomes  this article is the first to empirically examine the effect of consumer litigation funding  specifically  i explore the impact of nonrecourse loans on medical malpractice litigation outcomes by exploiting the variation in timing and geography from two ohio policy changes  the ohio supreme court s 2003 ban of funding in rancman v  interim settlement funding corporation and the state s subsequent legislative legalization of funding in 2008  using closed claim data from the national practitioner data bank  i find evidence that the availability of funding increases claim payment and claim duration  
 consumer redress legislation  simplifying or subverting the law of contract the growth of statutory consumer protection regimes in modern commercial societies has the potential profoundly to disrupt the private law landscape  such schemes aim to increase access to justice for consumers by offering simplified and clear suites of rights and corresponding remedies  in so doing  however  they affect core areas of private law rights and remedies  and may come to undermine or replace existing contractual principles and policies  the result could be an incoherent system of private law with different principles and rules applying to commercial and consumer transactions  coherence in the law requires that lawyers abandon their traditional oil and water  attitudes to legislative schemes and confront directly the interactions between these two bodies of law  this paper engages in that enquiry by considering the relationship between the relatively new consumer redress provisions in the consumer protection from unfair trading regulations 2008 and general law principles  
 contracting for a european insolvency regime the european commission has proposed a directive on  preventive restructuring frameworks  for financially distressed firms  i demonstrate that the proposal is flawed because it creates a refuge for failing firms that should be liquidated  because it rules out going concern sales for viable firms  and because it is  in essence  a twisted and truncated insolvency proceeding  i also demonstrate that the commission s harmonisation plan is misguided  if implemented  financing costs for firms would rise  the plan would cast in stone an inefficient restructuring framework on a european wide scale  preventing member states from experimenting with more efficient procedures  and it would lead to more written off loans instead of fewer non performing loans  the commission should withdraw its proposal  i suggest an alternative regulatory proposal  european firms should have the option to choose a  european insolvency regime  in their charter  this regime should be embodied in a european regulation  guaranteeing legal certainty to stakeholders  firms might be given the additional option to have the regime enforced by a specialised european insolvency court  this proposal would preserve horizontal regulatory competition between the member states for the best  insolvency product   and it would introduce vertical regulatory competition between the member states and the eu in the field of insolvency law  key design principles of the proposed optional  european insolvency regime  are the following   1  it should be open for restructurings  going concern sales  and liquidations  firms should be channelled into the appropriate process based on the opinion of a court appointed supervisor   2  it should be a fully specified  complete  and fully collective insolvency proceeding   3  the proceeding should be conducted in dip form with the mandatory appointment of a supervisor who performs important insolvency related functions

 contrasting the efficacy of the mmpi 2 rf overreporting scales in the detection of malingering though it has been the most extensively used instrument for forensic evaluation  the mmpi 2 is being gradually replaced by the mmpi 2 rf version  requiring evidence research to support it  a malingering design was implemented to assess the efficacy of the overreporting validity scales in discriminating between a group of malingerers and the general and clinical populations in a forensic context  of a total of 878 subjects  309 were from the general population  308 from the clinical population  and 261 were instructed to malinger a psychological injury  the results showed that malingerers scored significantly higher than the clinical and general population on the f r  fp r  fbs r  fs and rbs scales  as for the classification of cases  the f r  fp r  fbs r  fs  and rbs scales classified correctly and significantly between malingerers and honest respondents from the general population  and the f r and fp r scales between malingerers and clinical population  additionally  the results showed f r incremental validity over fp r  and vice versa  thus  f r and fp r scales are independent and may be accumulated to detect malingering  forensic practical implications from the results were derived and discussed   c  2017 colegio oficial de psicologos de madrid  published by elsevier espana  s l u  
 contributory negligence in the court of appeal  an empirical study in this paper we report the results of an empirical study of 112 appellate decisions on the contributory negligence doctrine in england and wales between 2000 and 2015  it is the first study of its kind in any common law jurisdiction  and builds on earlier research in which we looked at the doctrine s operation in first instance courts  our dataset comprised every appellate decision in which contributory negligence was an issue that was handed down during the study period and which we were able to access electronically  the most important findings include the fact that appeals succeed more frequently in relation to the existence of contributory negligence than with respect to apportionment  that the overall prospect of winning an appeal on contributory negligence does not depend on whether the first instance court is a county court or the high court  that claimants are nearly twice as likely to win an appeal regarding the existence of contributory negligence as defendants  and that by far most common discount imposed following an appeal is 50   
 convergence and divergence in capital market systems  the case of brazil there are common aspects in the corporate law of the most important economies  such as free transferability of shares  legal personality  and limited liability  those aspects  however  develop in different ways and at different speeds in each country  as they are a product of local economic and regulatory influence  the foremost example is the well known distinction between countries where dispersed ownership prevails and those where defined control is more commonly found  despite the existence of differences  there seems to be a convergence throughout the world  historically  brazil has been part of the concentrated control group  but it is also participating in the convergence process  for example  public corporations with dispersed ownership and attempted hostile takeovers are emerging in brazil  this article aims to analyse whether there are certain important conditions in the brazilian reality for a convergence towards an environment of dispersed ownership  thus  this study  which does not pretend to be exhaustive  seeks to analyse the following existing issues   1  reduction of private benefits of control   2  protection against creeping acquisitions   3  conflicts of interest   4  voting  and  5  liability of the controlling shareholder  
 coping with criminal victimization and fear of crime  the protective role of accommodative self regulation purposethe protective role of accommodative coping in mitigating possible aversive consequences of criminal victimization and fear of crime was investigated across different types of criminal offences and age groups  methodstwo hundred and forty six participants aged 15 77years participated in a cross sectional  internet based questionnaire study  they provided information on their experiences of criminal victimization  depressive symptoms  fear of crime  fc   and accommodative coping  resultsmultiple regression analyses showed that accommodative coping had a moderating  buffering  effect  both on the positive relationship between criminal victimization and fear of crime and on the positive relationship between fear of crime and victims  depressive symptoms  the greater the tendency of accommodative coping was  the weaker were the relationships between criminal victimization and fear of crime  and between fear of crime and depressive symptoms  conclusionsthe results indicate that accommodative processes could indeed facilitate adaptive coping with criminal victimization and could  at least for some of the assumed negative psychological consequences  have a protective effect

 copyright and related rights in canada and abroad  a view towards a more globally unified system of neighbouring rights although the rome convention sets an international standard for the protection of music makers  neighbouring rights  performers from different countries or jurisdictions are afforded differing compensatory schemes for the public performance of their sound recordings  2017 is mandated per section 92 of the canadian copyright act as the year in which  a committee of the senate  of the house of commons  or of both houses of parliament is to be designated or established for the purpose of reviewing this act   the challenge motivating this article is to identify areas of legal disparity  to suggest suitable approaches to institutional change  and to attempt to balance international differences to envisage a more coherent cross border neighbouring rights framework  the article starts with an original overview of canadian  american  and european neighbouring rights law  it proceeds to examine sources of differentiation between international neighbouring rights frameworks from a canadian perspective  it then proposes some modest reform to canadian copyright law based on the previously enumerated data and analysis  the article concludes by suggesting future research directives  
 copyright s framing problem copyright law has a framing problem  the problem is pervasive  unresolved  and often unnoticed  and it significantly impacts the nature and scope of copyright protection  copyrighted works are complex  books consist of chapters  newspapers consist of articles  and so on  courts often need to decide whether to frame the work as one comprehensive whole  an approach we call  zooming out   or to frame it as a combination of many small parts  an approach we call  zooming in   this framing move occurs across many copyright doctrines  fair use  infringement analysis  statutory damages calculations  separability determination  and more  this article focuses on decisions heavily affected by a court s framing choice  the results are troubling  the study of those decisions suggests that in the majority of cases  courts frame the work without noticing their framing move  when courts do explicitly provide reasoning for their framing choices  they use factors that are normatively questionable and increasingly less effective in today s digital world  consequently  copyrighted works are framed in an inconsistent way both across copyright law doctrines and within each doctrine  in fact  there is almost no area of copyright law in which courts consistently frame copyrighted works  these variations in framing choices have costs  while these costs need to be acknowledged and addressed  we reject one intuitively appealing approach to addressing them  copyright law  we show  should not provide a unified framing test  or unified definition of the  work   across all its doctrines  different areas of copyright law face different policy considerations  sometimes the framing of the work itself may need to change  so that the policy balance behind copyright law can remain constant  
 corporate compliance as a problem of cultural motion the culture concept has taken on an explanatory role in popular media accounts of corporate misconduct  from enron in the early 2000s to the recent volkswagen emissions cheating scandal  however  the concept  from its origins in the enlightenment philosophy of immanuel kant at the end of the eighteenth century through its transformations within the discipline of anthropology during the twentieth century  has continued to undergo refinement  this article outlines recent developments in culture theory  focusing on one novel approach to culture as a form of motion  this approach views culture as propelled  retarded  and altered in its movement through the world by four classes of force  inertial  entropic  metacultural  and interest based  i argue that the approach illuminates the problem of corporate compliance  true compliance occurs when the force of an explicitly formulated regulation a metacultural force is brought to bear on conduct  much of what appears to be compliance in this true sense is actually habitual cultural practice  driven by inertia  an important source of metacultural force inside the corporation is the coherence of its regulations and internal motivations  that is  its ethos  correspondingly  the sources of non compliance include ethos incoherence  the article concludes with two corporation external sources of ethos incoherence legal theories regarding corporations as existing exclusively for the benefit of shareholders  and economic theories emphasizing the self regulatory character of markets and the quest for profit  compliance  from this perspective  depends in part on the relationship between corporations and their external cultural environment  
 corporate governance regulation through nonprosecution over the last decade  federal corporate criminal enforcement policy has undergone a significant transformation  firms that commit crimes are no longer simply required to pay fines  instead  prosecutors and firms enter into pretrial diversion agreements  pdas   prosecutors regularly use pdas to impose mandates on firms  creating new duties that alter firms  internal operations or governance structures  doj policy favors the use of such mandates for any firm with a deficient compliance program at the time of the crime  this article evaluates pda mandates to determine when and how prosecutors should use them to deter corporate crime  we find that the current doj policy on mandates is misguided and that mandates should be imposed more selectively  specifically  mandates are appropriate only if a firm is plagued by policing agency costs in that the firm s managers did not act to deter or report wrongdoing because they benefited personally from tolerating wrongdoing or from deficient corporate policing  moreover  only mandates that are properly designed to reduce policing agency costs are appropriate the policing agency cost justification for mandates that we develop calls into question both the extent to which mandates are used and the type of mandates that are imposed by prosecutors  
 corporate privilege and an individual s right to defend a recent memo issued by the department of justice has shifted federal policy to ensure that individuals responsible for corporate wrongdoing are held accountable  no longer will federal prosecutors be satisfied with sanctions against corporate entities  this shift in focus  however  creates a new challenge which has  so far  received inadequate attention  how to reconcile the employee or officer s right to present an advice of counsel defense and the corporation s right to assert the attorney client privilege  under many federal statutes designed to deter and punish corporate wrongdoing  a prosecutor or plaintiff must demonstrate that the defendant acted with the requisite mens rea  if an employee can establish that she acted on advice of counsel  she may have a defense to liability  but if the corporation can assert attorney client privilege  precluding her from introducing the content of her attorney client communications  the employee may be unable to mount an effective defense  judicial efforts to resolve the conflict between corporate and employee interests have been inadequate  in the civil context  especially  courts have recently declined to protect employee interests  holding that the employee s right to present a defense should never trump the corporation s right to maintain confidentiality  reform is needed to better protect the interests of officers and employees  fairness dictates that courts should condition a corporation s ability to assert privilege on an agreement to indemnify an employee deprived of the right to assert a legitimate advice of counsel defense  although not perfect  this solution best balances the interests of corporations and employees  
 corporate restructuring and corporate dissolution of companies in financial distress  ensuring creditor protection  a comparison of the us  uk and dutch models where a company is in financial distress  there are two options  rescue of the  viable  company by restructuring or liquidation of the  unviable  company by dissolution  in practice  the most important restructuring procedure is the us chapter 11  many european jurisdictions have used chapter 11 as a source of inspiration for the enactment of their restructuring proceedings  however  in europe  national restructuring rules vary greatly in respect of the range of procedures available to companies in financial distress aiming at restructuring  some european jurisdictions do not provide for formal restructuring procedures at all  unviable companies in financial distress are too broke to restructure  in most european jurisdictions  unviable companies can be dissolved very quickly and cheaply  however  these procedures also differ from each other  copyright  c  2017 insol international and john wiley   sons  ltd  
 corporate restructuring law  a second chance for europe  this article analyses critically the recent european commission s proposal for a new directive on corporate restructuring and a  second chance  for entrepreneurs  the article addresses the proposal in the context of the capital markets union project and also broader international indicators such as ch  11 of the us bankruptcy code  the article suggests that the proposal is europe s answer to ch  11 but is a work in progress rather than a fully finished product  it is also unwise to assume that if certain reforms are enacted  certain consequences will more or less automatically follow  events in 2016 indicated that the direction of travel with the european project is not necessarily linear and one way  
 corpus linguistics  misfire or more ammo for the ordinary meaning canon  scholars and judges have heralded corpus linguistics the study of language through collections of spoken or written texts as a novel tool for statutory interpretation that will help provide an answer in the occasionally ambiguous search for  ordinary meaning  using dictionaries  in the spring of 2016  the michigan supreme court became the first to use corpus linguistics in a majority opinion  the dissent also used it  however  and the two opinions reached different conclusions  in the first true test for corpus linguistics  the answer seemed to be just as ambiguous as before  this result calls into question the utility of corpus linguistics  if the michigan supreme court could reach opposite conclusions about the ordinary meaning of a word when both opinions used the same database  can one really consider corpus linguistics an effective aid to statutory interpretation  this note first argues that the michigan supreme court s majority opinion conducted a flawed search of the database and that the dissent s contrary conclusion was correct  in addition  this note contends that transparency the greatest strength of corpus linguistics  outweighs the risk that judges may fail to use a corpus linguistics database accurately because that transparency permits advocates  other judges  and legal scholars to review the court s analysis  aiding appellate review  lastly  this note includes recommended steps to guide the use of a corpus linguistics database in the search for ordinary meaning  
 cost of cure damages and the relevance of the injured promisee s intention to cure the article focuses on whether  when considering whether to award cost of cure damages  the courts take account of what the injured promisee to a breach of contract does  or intends to do  with his damages award  and whether or not they should take account of it  this issue has given rise to divergent approaches and some confusion in the cases  the article seeks to shed new light on the issue and considers possible ways of resolving the confusion  
 cost benefit analysis and the structure of the administrative state  the case of financial services regulation the viability and desirability of conducting cost benefit analysis of financial regulation is a subject of intense academic debate  opponents claim that such analysis is feasible for environmental regulation but not for financial regulation because of the difference in the benefits that require monetization in the respective areas  this article argues that the recent debate misses an important part of the problem  in large part  cost benefit analysis of financial regulation cannot currently be performed successfully because of institutional shortcomings  not analytical difficulties  compared to executive branch agencies  independent agencies  like the major financial regulatory agencies  lack the capacity to do cost benefit analyses of acceptable quality  fortunately  there are good executive branch models that could be exported to the financial regulatory agencies  in particular  the financial stability oversight council could implement a robust coordinating role diffusing macroeconomic expertise  learning from the experience of the interagency working group set up to estimate the damage of one ton of carbon dioxide emissions  moreover  the president could extend to independent agencies his executive order vesting in the office of information and regulatory affairs the responsibility to review significant federal regulations  though no president has yet taken this step  in part because of fears of a congressional backlash  the time might now be ripe to do so  and  the financial regulatory agencies could learn from the experience of the environmental protection agency in building significant economic expertise to aid the preparation of cost benefit analyses  the article also considers the role of judicial review  it takes issue with the influential argument that oira review can serve as an alternative to judicial review  showing that such an outcome would be inconsistent with settled principles of administrative law  but oira review can lead to more deferential judicial review  by serving as a signal that reviewing courts are likely to find reassuring  
 costly voluntary disclosure with negative expected value suits a standard result in the litigation literature is that the informed party will not make a costly voluntary disclosure in a screening game  we develop a screening game in which an uninformed plaintiff makes an offer to an informed defendant  under the american rule for the allocation of trial costs  we find that the defendant will make a costly voluntary disclosure if he can demonstrate to the plaintiff that she has a negative expected value suit  by doing so  the defendant can induce the plaintiff to drop the lawsuit  this assumes that the cost of a voluntary disclosure is less than the cost of a full trial to the defendant  as a result of the information disclosure  the model will never exhibit the type of constrained equilibrium described by nalebuff  1987   credible pretrial negotiation   18 rand journal of economics 198 210   
 counterfeiting and piracy in international trade  the good  the bad and the     oxymoron of  real fakes  the rise of the importance of intellectual property rights  iprs  at the global level as well as the proliferation of regional trade agreements  rtas  call for a more careful and more balanced consideration of the debate about the future of the global protection and enforcement of iprs  exemplified by the problem of international trade in pirated and counterfeit products  especially in the context of the fashion industry  the present article sets out to identify the major shortcomings of the present regulatory debate  these shortcoming are those of a limited number of stakeholders clearly divided into the  good  and the  bad   a stronger interest in negative rather than positive externalities  and  ultimately  a predominantly dualistic conception of intellectual property law in particular and law in general  this dualistic conception will be critically contrasted by a look at several business reports about the creative fashion industry and the introduction of the oxymoronic notion of  real fakes   as an oxymoronic concept  the real fake is used to identify a wider linguistic trend in contemporary scientific debates  which may serve as a reminder to complement dualistic reasoning by more paradoxical forms of thinking as well as related regulatory concepts  
 courting custom  regulating access to justice in rural south africa and malawi the continued relevance of customary law for the regulation of the daily lives of africa s citizens poses serious governance challenges to sovereign states  such as how best to regulate customary dispute settlement  while confronted with largely similar problems  the south african government proposed to enhance and regulate the position of its traditional courts  whereas malawi has opted for the creation of hybrid local courts that combine characteristics of regular state courts and customary fora to be the main avenue of customary law cases  this paper analyzes the strengths and weaknesses of both approaches and displays how the two countries  historical and political contexts enable and constrain their regulatory choices in the field of customary dispute settlement  as well as influence the risk and benefits of the various options  in this respect  the political power of the traditional leaders is a significant determinant  
 credit  crisis and contract enforcement  evidence from the spanish loan market a number of theoretical and empirical studies have shown that the development of credit markets is affected by the efficacy of enforcement institutions  a less explored question in this context is how these institutions interact with turns in the economic cycle and the impact of different types of legal procedures on credit market performance  this paper fills these gaps by analyzing how differences in the availability of credit and the evolution of non performing loans ratios may be partially explained by regional variations in the quality of loan contract enforcement during recent periods of sustained growth  2001 2007  and recession  since 2008  in the spanish economy  this research concludes that a rise in the clearance rate of executions  i e   when a judge enforces the repayment of a debt  increases the ratio of total credit to gdp  however  the declaratory stage of the procedure  i e   when a debt is firstly verified by a judge  does not seem to be statistically significant  a possible explanation to this finding is that  throughout the economic cycle  a relevant proportion of the defaults that take place are strategic  i e   defaults by a solvent debtor   furthermore  it is observed that  in regions where declaratory procedures are more efficient  less credit is declared as non performing  the latter effect  however  is only observed after the onset of the  great recession  in 2008  this may be related to the increase of non strategic defaults during a downturn  
 creditor rights protection  tort claims and credit we use a simple lending model where environmental accidents lead to bankruptcies to study the impact of stronger protection of creditor rights  in the model  both the borrower and the creditor undertake actions the former on accident reducing care and the latter on the screening of loan applicants  creditor rights may not be preserved entirely due to competing claims from tort victims  the impact of better credit protection crucially depends on the structure of the informational asymmetry  for situations where only the entrepreneur s action is privately observed  better protection of creditor rights leads to an improvement in the terms and availability of credit  when the actions of the borrower and the lender are both unobservable the results are completely reversed  the impact of better credit protection on social welfare is ambiguously dependent on the quality of borrowers   c  2017 elsevier inc  all rights reserved  
 crime seriousness and participation in restorative justice  the role of time elapsed since the offense restorative justice policies and programs aimed at facilitating victim offender mediation  vom  are part of many criminal justice systems around the world  given its voluntary nature and potential for positive outcomes  the appropriateness and feasibility of vom after serious offenses is subject to debate in the literature  in light of this discussion  this study first aimed to unravel the prevalence of serious offenses in cases registered for vom and examined whether crime seriousness predicts whether mediated contact is reached between victims and offenders  second  it tested the hypothesis that victims of increasingly serious  harmful crimes are more willing to participate when more time has elapsed since the offense in contrast to victims of less serious  harmful crimes  we analyzed 199 cases registered for vom in the netherlands and coded the perceived wrongfulness  harmfulness  and average duration of incarceration of an offense as 3 distinct indicators of crime seriousness in these cases  the findings revealed that cases registered for vom  a  are  in terms of the incarceration duration  on average more serious than all offenses in the population  and  b  resulted in mediated contact  or not  independently of the 3 seriousness indicators  in addition  empirical support was found for the hypothesis that victims  willingness to participate in vom increased over time after more harmful offenses  whereas it decreased when offenses inflicted less harm  these findings suggest that when vom programs operate irrespectively of the time elapsed after crime  mediated contact between parties may be as likely after minor and serious offenses  
 criminal background checks and recidivism  bounding the causal impact this paper estimates the effect of employment denial based on a criminal background check on recidivism outcomes for individuals with convictions who are provisionally hired in the new york state healthcare industry  using institutional knowledge about the new york state department of health s screening process  i build structural assumptions on potential outcomes for different subsamples in my data  which partially identifies the average treatment effects  i find a 0 2 2 percentage point increase in the likelihood of subsequent arrests caused by employment denial  with substantial heterogeneity across the sample  specifically  i find that the a priori highest risk individuals are most likely to be impacted by a loss of employment opportunity based on their criminal background  policy implications of these results are discussed   c  2017 elsevier inc  all rights reserved  
 criminalizing pregnancy the state of tennessee arrested a woman two days after she gave birth and charged her with assault of her newborn child based on her use of narcotics during her pregnancy  tennessee s 2014 assault statute was the first to explicitly criminalize the use of drugs by a pregnant woman  but this law  along with others like it being considered by legislatures across the country  is only the most recent manifestation of a long history of using criminal law to punish poor mothers and mothers of color for their behavior while pregnant  the purported motivation for such laws is the harm to the child from prenatal exposure to illegal drugs  but recent scientific studies undermine the harm narrative  this article is the first to take a close look at the science behind these laws  recent longitudinal studies confirm that the use of illegal drugs while pregnant  in and of itself rarely results in long term adverse consequences to the fetus and subsequent child  meanwhile  the negative consequences of ingesting licit substances such as tobacco  alcohol  and other lawfully prescribed medications  often are much greater than the potential undesirable effects of drug use  poverty  domestic violence  and a father s behavior prior to conception also have been shown to have significant harmful impacts on fetal development  although the criminalization of drug use by pregnant women does not prevent impairment of the fetus and subsequent child  it often leads to additional detrimental consequences  the state regularly steps in and removes children born to women using illicit drugs while pregnant  even when there is no evidence of harm to the child and despite the documented harms to newborns from placement in the foster care system  additionally  as every major medical organization has publicly indicated  pregnant women are less likely to seek prenatal care if they fear arrest for using drugs  creating damaging effects greater than any potential harms from the drug use  legislatures  unwillingness to acknowledge the empirical evidence contradicting the rationales for this latest batch of criminal laws might cause one to wonder whether the harm to the child is truly the motivating impetus behind these laws  the existing statutes have a disproportionate impact on poor mothers and mothers of color  in fact  class  and race  based constructions of motherhood go a significant distance toward explaining the presence of these laws  this article analyzes how our current approach to the use of drugs by pregnant women relies on these troubling economic and race  based social constructions  rather than on any scientific or empirical evidence  by challenging the erroneous presumptions motivating these laws  this article hopes to move legislatures toward effectively addressing the more substantial risks to developing fetuses  
 criminalizing vulnerability  protecting  vulnerable  children and punishing  wicked  mothers this article aims to uncover how  in attempting to ameliorate the vulnerability of children  the offence of causing or allowing the death of the child  criminalizes abused mothers  it explores how  in the courtroom  tropes of female criminality and constructs of the bad  mother are mobilized in ways that are both gendered and classed   the effect is to silence female defendants  deprive their actions of context  and deny them agency  this argument has implications for assessing the moral and legal culpability of abused women who fail to protect their children  because it shifts the focus onto how the abuser has exploited and exacerbated the vulnerability of both mother and child  this approach also challenges law s preoccupation with scrutinizing  and punishing  women who do not adhere to a glorified  middle class ideal of motherhood  more broadly  by focusing on the context of a woman s alleged failure   there opens a space within legal discourse to refute the characterization of female criminality as being either mad  or bad  and of women who engage in criminal behaviour as being either virgins  or whores   finally  in focusing on vulnerability as a universal and unavoidable part of the human experience  gendered assumptions of autonomy and the self other dichotomy are challenged  
 cross examination  a defense some researchers criticize the practice of cross examining child witnesses  a few critics go so far as to suggest that cross examination undermines the search for truth  this essay takes issue with critics of cross examination  and argues that  in the adversary system of justice  cross examination serves vital functions  while the essay defends cross examination  it acknowledges 2 important matters  first  developmentally inappropriate questions can undermine children s accuracy  and developmentally inappropriate questions abound in court  second  cross examination can undermine the accuracy of children s truthful testimony  a law is proposed to curtail developmentally improper questioning  the argument is made that the harm of occasional inaccuracy caused by cross examination is outweighed by the benefit of cross examination  
 crossfire on compulsory campus carry laws  when the first and second amendments collide despite college communities  overwhelming opposition to firearms on campuses  states are continuing to pass legislation forcing public higher education institutions to permit the secret carrying of firearms inside academic buildings and classrooms at an alarming rate  many students  faculty  and administrators believe the presence of firearms will stifle their first amendment right to free speech and academic freedom  as the mere presence of firearms will create an uncomfortable learning and working environment  additionally  it will make some professors and students more reticent to discuss controversial and sensitive issues out of fear that heated debates could become violent  on the other hand  campus carry proponents maintain they have a second amendment right to carry a firearm for self defense  thus  the campus carry issue raises two competing constitutional claims  this article is one of the first to posit that the first amendment rights to free speech and academic freedom trump the second amendment right to bear arms in the campus carry context  in making this case  part ii identifies the states with campus carry laws and shows how there is a frightening trend toward arming campuses  part iii cogitates several first amendment challenges that could be mounted against this legislation  part iv contemplates the second amendment argument that individuals have a right to carry on campus for self protection  part v explains why the first amendment claim should prevail  finally  part vi provides guidance on how to survive on an armed campus  
 crossing borders and criminalizing identity  the disintegrated subjects of administrative sanctions this paper draws on in depth  qualitative interviews that examine individual experiences in two different legal contexts  deportation regimes and supermax prisons  through putting these contexts and experiences into dialogue  we identify common legal processes of punishment experiences across both contexts  specifically  the u s  legal system re labels immigrants  as deportable noncitizens  and supermax prisoners  as dangerous gang offenders   this re labeling begins a process of othering  which ends in categorical exclusions for both immigrants and supermax prisoners  as individuals experience this categorical exclusion  they cross multiple borders and boundariesoften against their willmoving from prison to detention center to other countries beyond the u s  border  and from isolation to prison to free society  in both cases  the state action that subjects experience as punishment is civil and  therefore  nominally not punitive  ultimately  excluded individuals find themselves in a space of legal nonexistence  by examining these common processes and experiences  we argue that a new kind of subject is revealed  a disintegrating subject  as opposed to a juridical or disciplinary subject  whose exclusion reinforces the power of the state

 cumulative constitutional rights cumulative constitutional rights are ubiquitous  plaintiffs litigate multiple constitutional violations  or multiple harms  and judges use multiple constitutional provisions to inform interpretation  yet judges  litigants  and scholars have often criticized the notion of cumulative rights  including in leading supreme court rulings  such as lawrence v  texas  employment division v  smith  and miranda v  arizona  recently  the court attempted to clarify some of this confusion  in its landmark opinion in obergefell v  hodges  the court struck down state bans on same sex marriage by pointing to several distinct but overlapping protections inherent in the due process clause  including the right to individual autonomy  the right to intimate association  and the safeguarding of children  while also noting how the rights in question were simultaneously grounded in equal protection   the due process clause and the equal protection clause are connected in a profound way   justice kennedy wrote  the court did not  however  explain the connection  to redress harms to injured plaintiffs without creating doctrinal incoherence  courts need to understand the categorically distinct ways in which cumulative constitutional harm can occur and how these forms affect constitutional scrutiny  we argue that cumulative constitutional rights cases can be categorized into three general types and that these types need to be analyzed differently  the first type  aggregate harm  occurs when multiple discrete acts  taken together  add up to a harm of constitutional magnitude  even if each individual act  taken alone  would not  the second type  hybrid rights  occurs where a plaintiff claims a single action has violated rights under multiple constitutional provisions  if a court were to apply the proper level of scrutiny to the claims individually  however  none would result in redress  as a result  hybrid rights cases should not ordinarily result in relief the third type  intersectional rights  occur when the action violates more than one constitutional provision but only results in relief when the provisions are read to inform and bolster one another  our aim in this article is to provide a framework courts can use to analyze cumulative constitutional rights  while courts should be open to conducting a cumulative analysis  when constitutional rights are mutually reinforcing those relationships should be clearly set out and defined  
 custody stalking  a mechanism of coercively controlling mothers following separation this paper adds to our understandings of women s post separation experiences of coercive control through the introduction of a new concept custody stalking  it is defined as a malevolent course of conduct involving fathers  use of custody and or child protection proceedings to overturn historic patterns of care for children  the experience of custody stalking is explored through three composite narratives derived from twelve mothers who participated in an exploratory  qualitative study on the involuntary loss of maternal care time following separation  the losses suffered caused these mothers tremendous grief  damaged their psychological wellbeing and had a detrimental effect on their mothering relationships  yet custody stalking  as a form of malevolent attack  is not well recognised and mothers  resultant losses are largely culturally invisible  this is in marked contrast to paternal filicides  another form of post separation avenging attack committed by some fathers that also leads to maternal loss experiences  albeit more absolute  
 custom as law in english law this article considers prescription as a customary standard of legal validity which enables judges to identify certain customs as law even though the status of those customs as law cannot be ascribed to a law making authority  although claims as to customs having prescribed are often bound up with claims as to the quality  as opposed to the validity  of custom as law  prescribed custom is properly conceived to be a feature of the rule of recognition   a criterion by which a court can identify  and declare  a custom as already existing law as distinct from both custom without the force of law and custom turned into positive law  
 customary international law and the third world  do not step on the grass the article examines the recent debate between the experts of the asian african legal consultative organization and the international law commission on the identification of customary international law in light of the marginal role that the third world has played in customary law making  during the decolonization period  recently independent states and their scholars were quite resistant towards customary law  this cautious stance is justified by the central role of power in the formation of customary rules  though the doctrine of sources underwent significant reforms during this chapter  recent developments such as the acceleration of custom  the greater role of international organizations and the persistent objector doctrine have not been able to alter this undemocratic bias  therefore  one should be aware of these limitations when engaging cil from a third world perspective  
 damned if you do  damned if you don t challenges and critiques of preliminary examinations at the icc preliminary examinations are one of the most important  yet under studied elements of international criminal court  icc  practice  hardly any policy document raises greater anxiety than the yearly office of the prosecutor  otp  report on preliminary examinations  the current docket covers some of the world s most daunting crises  e g  ukraine  palestine  iraq and afghanistan   when the rome statute was drafted  little attention was devoted to preliminary examination  most work on international criminal procedure focuses on investigations  this contribution shows that preliminary examinations have turned partly into a new species of proceedings  somewhere between internal analysis  atrocity alert  and monitoring of situations  the otp strategic plan  2016 2018  associates preliminary examination with ambitious rationales  such as early warning  deterrence  or complementarity  but the functioning  purpose and effectiveness of preliminary examinations remain contested  there is a significant gap between expectations and reality  this contribution revisits some of the competing approaches to preliminary examinations in particular  and icc practice in general  the grey zones in the legal framework and emerging methodological challenges  e g  phase based approach  prioritization  confidentiality v  transparency   it argues that certain dilemmas will never fully go away and do not necessarily lend themselves to abstract legal regulation  but it suggests certain improvements to practice  including deeper engagement with situations and their context  a better connection between atrocity alert and complementarity strategies  and a more thorough explanation of choices not to proceed  the longer a preliminary examination lasts  the more pressing these requirements become

 de constitutionalisation and majority rule  a democratic vision for europe european integration has long relied on the democratic legitimacy of its member states without paying much attention to the increasing importance of its multilevel governing processes  at this time  however  europe is caught in the intersection of multiple crises  all of which brexit as well as the euro crisis  the refugee crisis as well as the crises in europe s relations with its eastern and southern  near abroad  are challenging the effectiveness as well as the democratic legitimacy of government on european and national levels  these dual challenges are connected  democratic legitimacy presupposes effective governing and problem solving capacity  hence the failure of output legitimacy may undermine or even destroy the possibility of input legitimacy a risk for which the fate of the weimar republic remains a most disturbing memento  at the same time  however  the lack of input legitimacy in the present european context will constrain and may ultimately destroy the effectiveness of measures based on non accountable supranational authority  
 de centralized decision making under the european resolution framework  does meroni hamper the creation of a european resolution authority  the eu bank recovery and resolution directive  brrd  shifts the focus from reacting in the face of a crisis  to planning and preparing to avoid uncoordinated  ad hoc measures and aims to ensure banks resolvability  it strengthens and harmonizes early intervention measures and gives supervisors new tools and powers for managing failing banks while continuing part of their business  i e  critical functions  the brrd was conceived out of a need to reduce public funds being used to bail out banks considered  too big to fail  and strengthen cooperation and coordination between member states  the first part of this paper sets out how key resolution decisions  including during recovery and resolution planning  are taken for cross border banking groups within the eu  and within the single resolution mechanism  srm  of the euro area  it also considers the impact of the brrd on cooperation with third countries  small host countries   the second part of the paper offers a legal analysis of why no autonomous centralized decision making powers were delegated to the single resolution board  srb   it considers whether legal judgements made in 1956 and enshrined as the  meroni doctrine  actually prohibit delegation of fully autonomous resolution powers to the srb and more broadly prevent the creation of a centralized resolution agency for the whole eu  
 dead hand proxy puts and shareholder value we study the impact of dead hand proxy puts on shareholder value  courts and commentators have characterized these terms as defenses against hedge fund activism that threaten to reduce firm value by entrenching underperforming managers and thereby increasing managerial agency costs  our findings contradict this view  using three court cases as a natural experiment  we find that shareholders do not react negatively to the inclusion of a dead hand proxy put in a firm s loan agreements  not only do dead hand proxy puts not destroy firm value  they may even preserve it by deterring activists who would seek to extract wealth from creditors and other nonshareholder constituencies  we develop the policy implications of these findings and offer a direction for the evolution of legal doctrine in this area  
 debt restructuring and notions of fairness this article examines concern for fairness in the way in which loss is distributed when a company or financial institution facing financial difficulties is restructured  it shows how this concern is often grounded in loose notions of fairness  or generalisations from one situation to another  rather than in detailed analysis  adopting an interdisciplinary approach  it builds an analytical frame for the fairness debate in debt restructuring  it shows why rigour is important in identifying fairness concerns  in weighing them against other considerations  and in applying concerns which arise in one scenario to another  and illustrates the types of policy mistake or policy incoherence which can arise if this is not done  
 decades of eu energy policy  towards politically driven markets looking back over the last 30 years  the european union s energy policy has gone through multiple significant changes  the national monopolies have been broken up and markets have been liberalised  however if we focus on the last 10 years  the picture is very different  trust in the invisible hand of the markets is fading away and governmental control is returning in many areas  looking at natural gas markets and infrastructure investments  this article illustrates the change in the eu s approach from markets and market mechanisms to increasingly intrusive public sector control  not only is the public sector deciding what to invest and where  it is now also moving towards deciding which commercial projects should go forward and which should not  instead of markets being driven by commercial logic  the motivations behind cross  border natural gas projects are often political in nature  this is not in itself uncommon since energy and politics have always been closely connected at global level  however  it conflicts with the eu s policies in this area  which are based on liberal market thinking  
 decomposition patterns of buried remains at different intervals in the central highveld region of south africa burial of remains is an important factor when one attempts to establish the post mortem interval as it reduces  and in extreme cases  excludes oviposition by diptera species  this in turn leads to modification of the decomposition process  the aim of this study was to record decomposition patterns of buried remains using a pig model  the pattern of decomposition was evaluated at different intervals and recorded according to existing guidelines  in order to contribute to our knowledge on decomposition in different settings  a quantifiable approach was followed  results indicated that early stages of decomposition occurred rapidly for buried remains within 7 33 days  between 14 and 33 days  buried pigs displayed common features associated with the early to middle stages of decomposition  such as discoloration and bloating  from 33 to 90 days advanced decomposition manifested on the remains  and pigs then reached a stage of advanced decomposition where little change was observed in the next     90 183 days after interment  throughout this study  total body scores remained higher for surface remains  overall  buried pigs followed a similar pattern of decomposition to those of surface remains  although at a much slower rate when compared with similar post mortem intervals in surface remains  in this study  the decomposition patterns and rates of buried remains were mostly influenced by limited insect activity and adipocere formation which reduces the rate of decay in a conducive environment  i e  burial in soil   
 defending a communicative theory of punishment  the relationship between hard treatment and amends according to communicative theories of punishment  legal punishment is pro tanto justified because it communicates the censure that offenders deserve for their crimes  the aim of this article is to offer a modest defence for a particular version of a communicative theory  this version builds on the one that has been advanced by antony duff  according to him  legal punishment should be understood as a kind of  secular  penitential burden that is placed upon offenders to censure them for their crimes  with the aims that they will then come to repent  reform themselves and reconcile with those whom they have wronged  this article departs from duff s version  however  by arguing that the penitential burdens in question should be understood more specifically in terms of the amends that offenders ought to make to apologise for their criminal wrongdoings  the article then attempts to address three potential objections to this revised version of the communicative theory  
 delegation of legislative powers in the eu  how eu institutions have eluded the lisbon reform the establishment of delegated acts should have brought forward significant innovations  in principle  under art  290 tfeu  the commission now has the monopoly of delegated powers  which ought to be distinguished from implementing powers  the co legislators should control the delegation on an equal basis  and the comitology procedures should be formally demised  the article seeks to demonstrate that  in practice  these major reforms have been eluded  instead  a shift in the horizontal and vertical balance of delegated powers has occurred  in favour of the council and of the member states respectively  this has  in turn  limited the possible constitutional added value of the treaty reform  in particular in relation to the principle of separation of powers  in conclusion  the article argues that  in view of the politicisation of the commission  it will be for the parliament and the ecj to reverse the current trend and fully realise the untapped potential of art  290 tfeu  
 delegation or implementation  the ambiguous divide central to the legal acts  architecture designed in lisbon is the concept of essential elements  defining the exclusive domain of legislation  derived acts are shaped as delegation and implementation  recent case law suggests that two separate conceptions of the eu legal acts system lie at the heart of this construction  each of them tied to a different understanding of the essential elements  one may be called static  it is forged in the image of delegation in constitutional law  and conceives of essential elements as binding meta norms contained in the basic act  the other may be called dynamic  arising from the communities  institutional practice  it is grounded in the institutions  reciprocal political autonomy and refers to essential elements as stemming from a legal political evaluation involving both the basic and the derived act  while pointing to the substantive legitimation of law making  though at odds as a matter of pure logic  both conceptions seem indispensable to enhance the legitimation of eu law making  yet how this legitimation actually works is an open issue for debate  
 delimiting the continental shelf beyond 200 nautical miles at the international court of justice  the nicaragua v  colombia cases in both nicaragua v  colombia cases  the international court of justice upheld that international tribunals may delimit the continental shelf beyond 200 nautical miles prior to the establishment of the continental shelf s outer limits  however  both the 2012 judgment on the merits in the first case  and the 2016 judgment on preliminary objections in the second case  raise a number of controversial issues  this article discusses the contentious aspects of these two judgments  first  it argues that the icj s decisions should have more strongly upheld that overlapping entitlements are a necessary precondition to maritime delimitation both within and beyond 200 nautical miles  with reference to the evaluation of evidence of entitlement provided by the parties  second  it examines the exceptional character of the bay of bengal cases  as well as the persuasiveness of the  practical impasse  argument invoked by nicaragua  
 democracy  law  compliance professors schauer and mcadams both seek a more or less sweepingly general theory of why we obey the law  but we should split  not lump  there are different reasons different actors in different social settings obey different laws not only  but not least  out of regard for democratic decision making  
 department of health consultation on medical examiners and death certification reforms  a commentary on the criteria for notification to be laid down in regulation the department of health has completed its consultation on the nature of the new medical examiner system and supporting regulations  this article considers whether the regulations for death notification to coroners are fit for purpose in the light of the medical literature on unnatural deaths and the experience of a coroner in a jurisdiction with a heavy workload from specialist hospital referrals  it concludes that they are to be welcomed  but that they should not rely on natural unnatural death as a criterion for notification of deaths during the course of medical treatment  or refer to neglect   furthermore  they should ensure that sudden death syndromes  which may be considered by doctors as natural  are still notified  relying on these changes to reduce coronial investigations would be unwise  if that is the intention  other reforms may be necessary  
 determining when to conduct a violence risk assessment  development and initial validation of the fordham risk screening tool  frst  techniques to assess violence risk are increasingly common  but no systematic approach exists to help clinicians decide which psychiatric patients are most in need of a violence risk assessment  the fordham risk screening tool  frst  was designed to fill this void  providing a structured  systematic approach to screening psychiatric patients and determining the need for further  more thorough violence risk assessment  the frst was administered to a sample of 210 consecutive admissions to the civil psychiatric units of an urban medical center  159 of whom were subsequently evaluated using the historical clinical risk management 20  version 3  to determine violence risk  the frst showed a high degree of sensitivity  93   in identifying patients subsequently deemed to be at high risk for violence  based on the case prioritization risk rating   the frst also identified all of the patients  100   rated high in potential for severe violence  based on the serious physical harm historical clinical risk management 20  version 3  summary risk rating   sensitivity was more modest when individuals rated as moderate risk were included as the criterion  rather than only those identified as high risk   specificity was also moderate  screening out approximately half of all participants as not needing further risk assessment  a systematic approach to risk screening is clearly needed to prioritize psychiatric admissions for thorough risk assessment  and the frst appears to be a potentially valuable step in that process  
 developing an evidence based perspective on interrogation  a review of the us government s high value detainee interrogation group research program interrogation practices in the united states have been roundly criticized both for their accusatorial ethos  at times leading to false confessions by the innocent  and for a history of applying physical and psychological coercion in law enforcement  military  and intelligence contexts  despite decades of psychological research demonstrating the failures of such approaches and despite recent positive advances in countries such as the united kingdom moving to an information gathering framework  little change has occurred in the training or practice of u s  interrogation professionals over the past 50 years  this article describes recent historical events that have led to the development of the first unclassified  government funded research program on the science of interviewing and interrogation  since 2010  the high value detainee interrogation group  hig  research program has identified effective approaches for developing cooperation and rapport  eliciting information  challenging inconsistencies by presenting evidence or information strategically  and assessing credibility using cognitive cues and strategic questioning tactics  the program has also examined the influence of culture and language  and has facilitated the translation of research from the laboratory to the field  in this context  we review the significant contributions of psychologists to understanding and developing ethical  legal  and effective interrogation practices  and we describe important future directions for research on investigative interviewing and interrogation  
 development and validation of the psychological abuse experienced in groups scale the aim of this study is the development and analysis of the psychometric properties of a new instrument to assess the possible psychological abuse experienced in a group setting  the psychological abuse experienced in groups scale was administered to 138 people who self identified as former members of abusive groups  an exploratory factor analysis revealed a common factor  which showed appropriate reliability  the scale scores were correlated with a prior measure aimed to assess group abusiveness  providing evidence of external validity  participants reported a higher degree of psychological distress than normative samples  and those who requested psychological counseling after leaving the group had suffered group psychological abuse to a greater extent  the scale covers a wide range of subtle and explicit abusive behaviors and overcomes the limitations of previous instruments  being useful in both research and applied settings   c  2017 colegio oficial de psicologos de madrid  published by elsevier espana  s l u

 devotion to legalism  on the brexit case this note examines the uk supreme court s judgment in the brexit case  miller v secretary of state for exiting the european union  the case upheld the decision of the high court  which rejected the claim that the foreign affairs prerogative provided a legal basis for giving notice to eu institutions of the uk s intention to withdraw from the eu  but the supreme court s preferred basis for dismissing that claim rested on the more general proposition that significant constitutional change can only be effected by statute  this position offers the germs of a jurisprudence of constitutional change and was substantiated by means of an analysis of parliament s dual capacity as legislator and constituent agent  miller also includes important and potentially innovative dicta on the relationship between international and domestic sources of law  
 differences in contract design between successful and less successful franchises the aim of this paper is to identify differences in contract design between successful and less successful franchise chains  comparing contracts from both groups of companies  we observe  on the one hand  that  1  franchise contracts are unbalanced irrespective of the chain s success  contracts cover franchisees  obligations more than franchisors  obligations  on the other hand  we find that  2  contracts in successful franchise chains are more complete  i e  cover a larger number of contingencies  than the less successful ones and  3  this difference lies in the contingencies regarding franchisees  obligations  which are more fully covered in the contracts of more successful chains  more specifically  within the contingencies regarding franchisees  obligations   4  successful chains restrict the franchisee decision rights more frequently on day to day business operations than on financial conditions or post contractual contingencies  these findings can be explained because successful chains are more sensitive to franchisees  opportunistic behavior  because they have learned how to manage and solve any potential conflicts  or because of differences in bargaining power  finally  5  franchisors  obligations are not statistically different between groups  which we interpret as evidence that relational contracting mechanisms do not substitute formalization  
 differences in treatment adherence  program completion  and recidivism among batterer subtypes the present study aimed to cross validate holtzworth munroe and stuart s typology in a spanish sample of court referred intimate partner violence batterers  the study also analyzed the typology s capability to predict treatment attendance  completion  and ipv recidivism two years after the treatment  the sample consisted of 210 batterers court referred to a batterer intervention program  using cluster analysis  three batterer subtypes were identified in accordance with the original typology  family only batterers  borderline dysphoric  and generally violent antisocial  the typology predicted program attendance  completion  and recidivism  batterers from the generally violent antisocial group attended a significantly lower number of sessions  presented the highest dropout levels  and had the highest recidivism rate followed by borderline dysphoric and family only batterers  these findings suggest that in order to increase the effectiveness of batterer intervention programs  batterers  different needs and risk profiles should be taken into account   c  2017 colegio oficial de psicologos de madrid  published by elsevier espana  s l u  
 digital access to culture  copyright in photographs of two dimensional art under australian copyright law photographs of cultural collections are an essential means of disseminating art and democratizing access to culture  this article reviews the policies of five major australian galleries on access to their collections  it finds they tend to claim copyright in photographs of their collections  including of public domain works  this reflects a perceived entitlement to control access to their digital collections  often bolstered by a misstatement of copyright exceptions  restrictive quasi copyright contract terms  licensing practices  and physical property rights in photography s appurtenances  this curbs the emancipatory potential of digitization  generating a conflict between the property interests of cultural institutions and the public interest in enhanced access to culture  the problem is particularly acute with respect to images of public domain art  exclusive control over which diminishes the public domain  this article considers the novel question of whether copyright subsists in photographs of two dimensional art under australian law  arguing that such photographs lack the originality indispensable to copyright subsistence  this conclusion significantly undermines cultural institutions  licensing models and challenges misconceptions of property rights in the photographic surrogates of two dimensional cultural objects  the article urges cultural institutions to liberate the digital surrogates of public domain art to enhance access to cultural capital  
 digital exhaustion of copyright after cjeu judgment in ranks and vasilevics in its usedsoft and ranks judgments the cjeu interprets the concept of distribution and its digital exhaustion with regard to copyright on computer programs  both concepts are read in a way that deviates from their meaning concerning copyright on other works  the reasons for that divergence are analysed and criticised  the computer programs directive should be interpreted in conformity with the wipo copyright treaty  case law should distinguish between the specific rationales that underlie certain aspects of the exhaustion doctrine  the cjeu s autonomous interpretation of the sale condition for exhaustion is unfortunate  among other things because downloaded copies are not goods subject to transferrable ownership  copyright law is not digital property law  the sale concept is drifting away from its original meaning  concerning the exceptions to the reproduction right on programs  it is upheld that backups cannot be provided to third parties  subsequent acquirers of programs by contrast do qualify as lawful acquirers who can benefit from the exception for intended use  calling on this exception  the court seems to set course to the recognition of a resale and or download right of some kind  in sum  the meaning of exhaustion has evolved from a boundary of an exclusive right  over a higher norm to a subjective right of a third party  in reality  the debate could be simplified by looking at rights rather than copies  with regard to the supply of digital content  the simultaneous existence of a material object and licence contract should be recognised  the former can be a sales or service contract  online deliveries are services  whoever holds a right to a service  can principally transfer that right and the licence to third parties  applying the same rationales that underlie the exhaustion doctrine would mean that clauses preventing such transfers are void  the actual exhaustion doctrine however need not be applied   c  2017 simon geiregat  published by elsevier ltd  all rights reserved  
 dilution law  vertical agreements  and the construction of consumption recent reorientations of the paradigms of 20th century antitrust law have underscored today s post scarcity regime  with its focus on uncovering and stamping out behaviour that weakens product manufacturers  incentives to invest in the scarcity  uniqueness and authenticity values that everyday goods and services conjure in consumers  minds  alongside the general intellectual property law developments that support dilution avoiding business practices  this article identifies recent case law that underlines the ways in which dilution thinking is surfacing in antitrust law  it evaluates the legal implications of such thinking based on a substantial social science literature that reveals the mechanisms by which marketing strategies that focus on a high price  uniqueness and authenticity do their work  as businesses increasingly employ strategies that seek to condense product information into simple decision making heuristics that deliberately invoke subconscious appeal to persuade  the normative force of consumer choice is called into question  in order to preserve the ability of consumers to effectively choose between alternatives  an increased promotion of intratype competition presents the greatest likelihood of arresting the sea change initiated by antitrust law s dilution revolution  the reason for this finding  as this article demonstrates  resides in the fact that the economic background the purchasing context often determines to a significant extent the manner in which consumers decide and act

 discretionary review and undesired cases courts sometimes face cases that may result in adverse post judgment official or public reactions  such real world repercussions e g   open defiance by public officials can be more costly for the court than the benefit of hearing and deciding the case  in these situations the court may be better off not taking the case from the outset  this paper examines how courts deal with such cases when they can avoid adjudication discretionary dockets  using a stylized screening model  the paper examines the implications of such discretion  in particular  it shows that some undesired real world outcomes are inevitable  and that broad control over their dockets should lead judges to take fewer cases in which the government is involved  further  the paper discusses this logic from a comparative design perspective  the two prevalent models of judicial review  the american and the european  seem to take opposing stances on discretionary review  however  both narrow supreme courts  control over their dockets  either by directly limiting their discretionary jurisdiction or by decentralizing judicial review  
 disentangling the risk assessment and intimate partner violence relation  estimating mediating and moderating effects to manage intimate partner violence  ipv   the criminal justice system has turned to risk assessment instruments to predict if a perpetrator will reoffend  empirically determining whether offenders assessed as high risk are those who recidivate is critical for establishing the predictive validity of ipv risk assessment instruments and for guiding the supervision of perpetrators  but by focusing solely on the relation between calculated risk scores and subsequent ipv recidivism  previous studies of the predictive validity of risk assessment instruments omitted mediating factors intended to mitigate the risk of this behavioral recidivism  the purpose of this study was to examine the mediating effects of such factors and the moderating effects of risk assessment on the relation between assessed risk  using the domestic violence screening instrument revised  dvsi r   and recidivistic ipv  using a sample of 2 520 perpetrators of ipv  results revealed that time sentenced to jail and time sentenced to probation each significantly mediated the relation between dvsi r risk level and frequency of reoffending  the results also revealed that assessed risk moderated the relation between these mediating factors and ipv recidivism  with reduced recidivism  negative estimated effects  for high risk perpetrators but increased recidivism  positive estimate effects  for low risk perpetrators  the implication is to assign interventions to the level of risk so that no harm is done  public significance statement this research found people evaluated as being at high risk for continuing intimate partner violence  ipv  were more likely to reoffend  as indicated by rearrest during an 18 month follow up  this finding persisted even though some were sentenced to time in jail or probation  which tended to reduce ipv for high risk perpetrators but increase ipv for lower risk perpetrators  the implication is to assign interventions to the level of risk so that no harm is done  
 disparate impact and the unity of equality law this article offers a new theory of disparate impact liability  this theory emerges from and advances a unified account of employment discrimination law as a whole  disparate impact claims target the same distinctive injury as do disparate treatment and nonaccommodation claims  suffering workplace harm because of one s race  sex  disability  or other protected status  this injury of  status causation  offends basic commitments to equality and individual freedom  focusing on status causation also draws directly from statutory text emphasizing causation and individual harm  unlike more familiar approaches centered on employers  decision making processes or social hierarchy between groups  a disparate impact claim s statistical comparison of group outcomes provides evidence that individuals have suffered status causation  group outcomes are constructed by aggregating individual outcomes  disparities between group outcomes can emerge only if many individual group members suffer harm because of their protected status  status causation   but not all group members suffer this injury  it is spread unevenly within the group  the statistical evidence demonstrates that some individuals suffered discrimination s injury  but it does not identibi which individuals  highlighting intra group variation in injury explains fundamental but otherwise perplexing features of disparate impact doctrine  refusing to treat group members as interchangeable explains the structure of the prima facie case  including its rejection of any  bottom line  defense based on aggregate workforce composition  also noted are other significant implications for remedies and for the relationship between employment discrimination law and redistributive social policy  in each case  the focus is on those individuals who have suffered status causation  not necessarily a group as a whole

 disproportionate impact  an impetus to raise the standard of proof at sentencing it is well known that in a criminal trial  the prosecution must prove culpability beyond a reasonable doubt  but during the subsequent sentencing phase  the standard of proof is much lower  a preponderance of the evidence  this relatively low standard can lead to a problem known as  disproportionate impact   disproportionate impact occurs when evidence of additional criminal activity is introduced during the sentencing phase and becomes more determinative of the defendant s punishment than the actual crime of conviction  such evidence can subject criminal defendants to significantly more punishment without the safeguards available at a criminal trial  and it may include uncharged and acquitted crimes  in response to this issue  some circuit courts fashioned an exception to the preponderance rule  raising the standard of proof to the clear and convincing standard to protect the due process rights of criminal defendants  however  use of this exception was curtailed in all circuits but the ninth when the supreme court rendered the sentencing guidelines advisory in 2005  this note analyzes the lopsided circuit split surrounding the disproportionate impact exception and challenges the notion that the exception is no longer necessary because the guidelines have become advisory

 divesting from climate change  the road to influence is fossil fuels divestment likely to achieve its aims  this article evaluates the rationales for divestment in terms of their capacity to give the campaign influence  it focuses on the direct effects of divestment on financial actors because divestment is a specific means of exerting influence outside of conventional political channels  in seeking to end fossil fuel industries in order to halt climate change  the campaign deploys a variety of arguments to win support and wield influence  namely  the legality of divestment and  indeed  the emerging duty to divest  investors  moral responsibility to avoid complicity in the fossil fuel economy  investors  moral responsibility to use their leverage against climate polluters  and the power of financial sanctions to create a business case for abandoning fossil fuels  although in combination they may be effective  each of these asserted rationales has some limitations that may diminish the influence of the divestment movement  moreover  the movement does not engage sufficiently with the systemic qualities of finance capitalism that must also be reckoned with in order to address broader patterns of environmental unsustainability  although the divestment movement aspires to ultimately change government policies on climate change  it may achieve greater influence by also seeking better government regulation of the financial economy  
 divided selves  professional role distancing among law students and new lawyers in a period of market crisis in the terms of erving goffman s classic role distancing analysis  newly admitted law students often aspire to an embraced lawyer role that directly expresses their personal and political values  empirical research has suggested that during law school these students are instructed in an amoral and apolitical vision of professionalism  the literature has paid less attention to how students internally experience these norms within their continual processes of self construction  this article takes an exploratory micro dynamic look at professional identity formation drawing on longitudinal interviews and identity mapping with three student cohorts  over the course of their legal education  students bound for large corporate law firms tended to report increasing professional role distancing  in contrast  students who pursued jobs in the public interest sector tended to sustain a more proximate conception of professional identity  overlapping with racial  gender  political  and other centrally constitutive roles  the article concludes with normative and theoretical implications  
 dividing the spoils  the impact of power sharing on possibilities for socioeconomic transformation in postconflict states transitional justice  tj  is increasingly concerned with transforming unjust economic structures through realizing socioeconomic rights  in postconflict states  the prospects for progressively realizing these rights are conditioned by  ordinary  post peace politics inasmuch as they are obstructive  permissive or actively constructive of pro poor policies and redistribution  or receptive to civil society pressure from below  while these domestic politics in turn are conditioned to a significant extent by how political and economic opportunity is shared in power sharing agreements  the impact of power sharing on possibilities for socioeconomic rights realization has attracted little attention in the tj literature  this is regrettable as economic power sharing tends to monopolize the resources needed for redistributive or welfarist policies that would underpin a  respect  protect  fulfil  framework of state obligations to reduce vulnerabilities associated with conflict related poverty  violence and displacement  furthermore  political power sharing often consolidates a political culture characterized by sclerotic policy formulation and ineffective governance  promotes unresponsive and exclusionary rule and further embeds or modifies preexisting patterns of patrimonial rule

 do reparations repair relationships  setting the stage for reconciliation in colombia colombia is groundbreaking in its approach of prioritizing victim involvement and participation in its peace process and including victims in peace agreement discussions in havana  colombia started this process with an ambitious reparations law  which aims to individually and collectively compensate almost 8 3 million victims in order to begin a reconciliation process  yet the link between reparations and reconciliation is inconclusive  this study looks at the impact of reparations on reconciliation through a comparative matched case research study of two colombian communities that are demographically similar and have similar histories of violence  but starkly different levels of reparations  the study employs a participatory methodological approach using inductive indicators of peace and reconciliation created by the communities themselves in order to create surveys that measure the impact of reparations on reconciliation  the study finds that both communities display low levels of reconciliation according to community defined indicators  and that there is little variance between the two villages in the way the community members define peace and reconciliation and in the levels of community defined peace and reconciliation in each community  based on these findings  the article concludes with four recommendations for more comprehensive and effective implementation of reparations programs in war affected communities  
 does eu competition policy support inclusive growth  this article proposes a novel methodology to strengthen the micro foundations of a macroeconomic assessment of eu competition policy  a unique database containing case specific information on merger and cartel decisions is exploited to conduct macroeconomic policy simulations using a dynamic stochastic general equilibrium model  the model has been extended to allow investigating the effects of eu competition policy interventions not only on standard macroeconomic variables such as gdp and employment  but also on distributional outcomes across households with different skill levels and across different types of income earners  capital owners  wage earners  and benefit recipients   the policy simulations presented include both direct and indirect  deterrent  effects of competition policy interventions  they show that competition policy has a sizeable impact on gdp growth  job creation  and the distribution of consumption across different types of households  
 does introducing lay people in criminal courts affect judicial decisions  evidence from french reform what is the effect of introducing jury members in criminal courts  while surveys regularly point out a demand by citizens for harsher punishment  the differences between surveys  and real decisions  conditions are large enough to cast a doubt on the results  the introduction of two jurors into a court composed of three professional judges in two french regions and for a subsample of crimes during sixteen months offers a good natural experiment  difference in differences or triple difference methods do not permit me to identify any major change in the probability of being convicted or in sentences given by a court including jurors  if some characteristics of the reform could partly explain those null results  they clearly go against the hypothesis of a major disagreement between professional judges and citizens when they have to make real decisions in criminal cases   c  2017 elsevier inc  all rights reserved  
 does it help  hurt  or something else  the effect of a something else response alternative on children s performance on forced choice questions forensic guidelines recommend minimizing forced choice questions when interviewing children  we investigated whether adding a  something else  alternative to forced choice questions affected 3 to 5 year olds   n   94  reports of an event involving innocuous touch  following a 1 week delay  children were randomly assigned to receive either standard 2 alternative forced choice questions or the same questions with an additional something else alternative  all children received 3 counterbalanced question types  correct alternative present  no correct alternative present  and unanswerable  children s overall accuracy was not affected by the something else alternative except on questions with no correct alternative present  where performance went from 15  to 31  accurate  children selected or generated inaccurate and speculative responses to the majority of unanswerable questions regardless of a something else alternative  these findings suggest that the inclusion of a something else alternative does not bypass concerns about the use of forced choice questions during interviews with children  
 does mandating cumulative voting weaken controlling shareholders  a difference in differences approach corporate scholars have long championed the use of mandatory cumulative voting in developing countries  yet  in comparison to majority or plurality voting  we know very little about its effectiveness  even though cumulative voting is allowed in most jurisdictions  in practice it is not widely used  taiwan stands out as a unique jurisdiction which mandates cumulative voting on all companies  therefore  taiwan is the only jurisdiction  to the best of our knowledge  that can be used to test the causal effect of cumulative voting on director election  taking advantage of an exogenous legal change that occurred in taiwanese corporate law in december 2011  we use panel data on 640 publicly traded companies from 2009 to 2015 in a difference in differences framework to tease out the effect of cumulative voting  from 2001 to 2011  cumulative voting was the default rule  and 20 companies opted for majority voting  while directors and supervisors are elected every three years  not all companies change boards in the same year  fixed effect panel regression models show that in the 2012 election about six months after the legal reform the cumulative voting rule appears to have weakened the controlling shareholders  control of the companies that had previously opted for majority voting  the controlling shareholders  control in the 2013  2014  and 2015 elections  however  did not decrease  the take away lesson is that mandating cumulative voting may not create a long term effect because controlling shareholders find other means to maintain influence  policymakers should leave the governance decisions to the firm and focus on rules that could restrain private benefits of control and enhance transparency to rein in controlling shareholders   c  2017 elsevier inc  all rights reserved  
 does the law on compensation for research related injury in the uk  australia  and new zealand meet ethical requirements  despite a consensus that society owes an ethical obligation to compensate for research related injury  and that no fault is the best ethical response  an assessment of the compensation arrangements in place in the uk  australia and new zealand shows that in general compensation arrangements fall below this ethical expectation  most subjects rely on ex gratia payment or an unenforceable assurance of payment in the event of injury  it is also likely that  given significant deficiencies in participant information about compensation arrangements in place for trials recommended by the supervisory ethics agencies in each jurisdiction  subjects only find out about their financial exposure in the event of injury  industry drafted guidelines governing compensation in commercially sponsored trials do not protect subjects  interests  but operate primarily to protect the interests of industry  the article considers potential solutions to the ethical deficiency of the compensation arrangements  and argues that the ethical corollary of the fact that society is the ultimate beneficiary of its members  participation in clinical research  is that society as a whole should bear the cost of participant injuries  through establishment of a central no fault compensation fund financed either by the state or those directly involved in biomedical research  
 doing gloss it is common for courts  the political branches  and academic commentators to look to historical governmental practices when interpreting the separation of powers  there has been relatively little attention  however  to the proper methodology for invoking such  historical gloss   this essay contends that  in order to gain traction on the methodological questions  we need to begin by considering the po   tential justifications for crediting gloss  for judicial application of gloss  which is this essay s principal focus  there are at least four such justifications  deference to the constitutional views of nonjudicial actors  limits on judicial capacity  burkean consequentialism  and reliance interests  as the essay explains  these differing justifications have differing methodological implications  and disaggregating them helps explain variations in the types of evidence that courts have credited in  discerning gloss  perhaps most notably  it helps explain why courts are often less demanding in requiring evidence of institutional acquiescence than commonly recited standards for gloss would tend to suggest  
 domestic explanatory documents and treaty interpretation the article discusses the increasing use by international courts and tribunals of domestic explanatory materialssuch as various statements  reports  and explanatory memoranda that usually complement the domestic approval of treatiesin the process of treaty interpretation  after examining the types of materials that can be used as interpretative aids in accordance with the general rules on treaty interpretation  articles 31 32 vclt   the article scrutinizes the various ways in which domestic explanatory materials have informed the interpretation of treaty provisions in the practice of international adjudicatory bodies  the analysis focuses on the legal grounds on which such materials have been admitted in the interpretative process  the reasons for which resort has been made to them by the adjudicating body  as well as the circumstances in which such documents have been invoked by the litigating parties  the article then discusses certain advantages and disadvantages stemming from the use of domestic explanatory materials in the interpretative process  
 domestic judicial defiance and the authority of international legal regimes tensions and occasional overt defiance of international courts suggest that compliance with international regimes is not a self evident choice for domestic judges  i develop a formal theory of domestic judicial defiance in which domestic and supranational judges vie for jurisprudential authority in a non hierarchical setting  the model emphasises the role of domestic non compliance costs and power asymmetries in determining the conduct of domestic and international judges  i argue that the eu represents a special case of a particularly effective international regime  weak domestic courts have little to gain from an escalated conflict with the european court of justice  but even domestic judicial superpowers like the german federal constitutional court have strong incentives to seek mutual accommodation with european judges  the analysis also yields new insights into concepts  such as  judicial dialogue  and  constitutional pluralism  that have featured prominently in the legal literature  and suggests new hypotheses for empirical research  
 drug proscriptions as proxy crimes our drug policy has been widely deemed a failure because the criminalization of drug use has not succeeded in reducing prevalence rates  i contend that the most promising basis to defend the justifiability of drug offenses is to construe them as proxy crimes  offenses designed to prevent the commission of other  more serious crimes  i make a case that many law enforcement officials use drug proscriptions for this purpose in the real world  when construed as proxy crimes  drug prohibitions are less vulnerable to some of the familiar objections brought against their legitimacy  nonetheless  the justification for punishing those who violate drug proscriptions remains unpersuasive  
 dynamic political contexts and power asymmetries  the cases of the blue nile and the yarmouk rivers this paper explores the evolving patterns of hydropolitical relations in the dynamic contexts of yarmouk and blue nile rivers in comparison  the analysis aims at shedding light over the complex implications that recent political and social changes have aroused for the water disputes between jordan and syria on the one hand  and ethiopia and egypt on the other  in both basins  cooperative efforts toward the integrated management of transboundary waters have been only partially effective and largely undermined by the perpetuation of unilateral actions by riparian states  in the case studies  the lack of a basin wide vision over the control and use of shared waters has resulted in disputes among the basin states and ultimately in an unsustainable  unfair  and unwise utilization of the resources  this paper argues that a substantive and effective integration of national water policies is unlikely to occur  unless power asymmetries are properly addressed in order to overcome the likelihood of hegemonic regimes  
 e residency and blockchain in december 2014  estonia became the first nation to open its digital borders to enable anyone  anywhere in the world to apply to become an e resident  estonian e residency is essentially a commercial initiative  the e id issued to estonian e residents enables commercial activities with the public and private sectors  it does not provide citizenship in its traditional sense  and the e id provided to e residents is not a travel document  however  in many ways it is an international  passport  to the virtual world  e residency is a profound change and the recent announcement that the estonian government is now partnering with bitnation to offer a public notary service to estonian e residents based on blockchain technology is of significance  the application of blockchain to e residency has the potential to fundamentally change the way identity information is controlled and authenticated  this paper examines the legal  policy  and technical implications of this development   c  2017 clare sullivan   eric burger  published by elsevier ltd  all rights reserved  
 economic analysis of e waste market despite international regulations that prohibit the trans boundary movement of electronic and electric waste  e waste   non reusable e waste is often illegally mixed with reusable e waste and results in being sent to developing countries  as developing countries are not well prepared to properly manage e waste  this illegal trade has important negative externalities and creates  environmental injustice   the two main information problems on the e waste market are imperfect monitoring and imperfect information on the so called  degree of purity  of the e waste  in this paper  we use a simple bilateral north south trade model and show that there exists an alternative e waste market that is better than the standard e waste market for developing countries  this alternative e waste market is a joint trade in reusable and non reusable e waste  in both cases  we consider demand and supply sides  plus the equilibrium of the e waste market to show that the alternative market that we propose is better for developing countries

 eli lilly v canada  the uncomfortable liaison between intellectual property and international investment law in 2012  eli lilly  a us pharmaceutical corporation  initiated an investor state arbitral claim against the canadian government after the canadian courts invalidated two of eli lilly s canadian patents  claiming that the application of the so called  promise doctrine  violates international patent law agreements  even though this is not the first investment arbitration case in which intellectual property rights have played such a substantial role  eli lilly s claim against canada illustrates an innovative attempt to employ an international investment agreement to protect iprs  with a private actor seeking to claim compensation for the invalidation of its patents  furthermore  it has created significant controversy over the inclusion and recognition of intellectual property rights as  investments  within the scope of international investment agreements  therefore  in this article  we examine the initial granting and revocation of eli lilly s patents in more detail  and discuss the critical problems arising from the possibility of private investors directly challenging domestic patent laws  compliance with international patent agreements before international arbitral tribunals  
 eliciting information from human sources  training handlers in the scharff technique purposein previous laboratory based work  the scharff technique has proved successful for gathering intelligence from human sources  however  little is known about whether the technique can be taught to practitioners  and whether scharff trained practitioners will interview more effectively than colleagues using their conventional approaches and tactics  methodwe examined professional handlers from the norwegian police  n 64   all experienced in interacting with informants  half received training in the scharff technique  and their performance was compared against handlers receiving no scharff training and free to use the approaches they saw fit  all handlers received the same case file describing a source holding information about a future terrorist attack and were given the same interview objectives  police trainees  n 64  took on the role of semicooperative sources and were given incomplete information about the attack  resultsthe trained handlers adhered to the scharff training as they  1  aimed to establish the illusion of knowing it all    2  posed claims to collect information  and  3  asked few  if any  explicit questions  in contrast  the untrained handlers tried to evoke the sources  motivation to reveal information and asked a high number of explicit questions  scharff trained handlers were perceived as less eager to gather information  but collected comparatively more new information  conclusionsthe scharff trained interviewers utilized more specific elicitation tactics  e g   posing claims  and fewer general interview strategies  e g   evoking motivation   and they collected comparatively more new information  this captures the essence of the scharff technique  it is subtle  yet effective  
 embracing the  human factor  is there new impetus at the icc for conceiving and prioritizing intentional environmental harms as crimes against humanity  in 2016  the office of the prosecutor  otp  of the international criminal court  icc  published its policy paper on case selection and prioritisation  part of a series of documents explaining otp investigative and prosecutorial standards  one key factor informing the selection  and prioritization  of a case is the gravity of the alleged crime s   taking into account considerations such as the means by which they were committed and their impact  in this context  the prosecutor specifically recognizes the grave significance of environmental harms  prompting this article s analysis of the relationship between such circumstances and the constitutive elements of crimes against humanity  moreover  the prosecutor s recognition of the  human factor  in environmental harms  although introduced primarily in the context of a  sufficient gravity  analysis  may be of greater significance than its context might suggest  offering a powerful and common sense perspective which could lead not only to wider and more comprehensive justice for humankind but also offer important  spill over  benefits  such as protecting the environment and even combating climate change  such crimes thus truly are some of the most serious crimes of international concern  and warrant international attention  
 emissions trading for households  a behavioral law and economics perspective this is the first research article on expanding emissions trading in the eu to households in which law and economics is explicitly and systematically combined with behavioral science  the goal of the article is neither to plead in favor nor against emissions trading for households  but rather to provide an analysis of such a scheme  to that end  the article gathers relevant theoretical insights and discusses how established empirical findings can be used to design a potentially workable scheme  the analysis not only presents an overview of possible economic and behavioral barriers  but also creates a feedback to its institutional design by presenting possible solutions to overcome them  downstream allocation creates a more direct and visible carbon incentive  whereas administrative costs can be reduced by concentrating monitoring and enforcement upstream  behavioral acceptance can be boosted via strategic communication  for instance by stressing that emissions trading is both effective  emissions are capped  and fair  those who emit less  pay less   energy conservation can be stimulated by frequently sending updates to households of their carbon transactions to make the consequences of their behavior more noticeable  whether these necessary conditions are also sufficient to ensure political acceptance remains an open question

 enabling valid informed consent for location tracking through privacy awareness of users  a process theory people use mobile devices for an increasing variety of purposes in order to enjoy the vast possibilities  they check the local weather  road traffic  personalised local news  their personalised favourite social network  etc  at the same time  application developers and market stores deploy mobile applications that collect vast amounts of information on mobile users  such as their age  gender  location or specific phone identifiers  numerous studies illustrate that mobile applications collect valuable information about users and use it for profiling the users for their own purposes or sell this information for commercial interests  therefore  the topic of consent to information processing becomes increasingly more interesting for researchers  legal experts and practitioners  in this paper  the authors examine the issue of valid informed consent for location tracking by mobile phone users  they first analyse the legal premises for informed consent that represent requirements for mobile application developers and providers who request consent  however  the ones who actually give consent are the mobile users and therefore their understanding of consent is of paramount importance  extensive literature is missing on empirical studies examining the topic from the users  perception perspective  for that reason  the authors conduct an empirical investigation with mobile users and present their findings in the form of a process theory  the process theory reveals how users  valid informed consent for location tracking can be obtained  starting from enhancing reading the privacy policy to stimulating privacy awareness and  enabling informed consent  the paper includes a discussion section in which the authors describe the implications of the process theory for the different stakeholders and offer recommendations deriving from the empirical findings  the contribution is addressed to software and mobile application developers and providers  technology regulation researchers and policy makers  as well as security and privacy researchers   c  2017 aggeliki tsohou   eleni kosta  published by elsevier ltd  all rights reserved  
 end impunity  reducing conflict related sexual violence to a problem of law whilst sexual violence has been an offence associated both with war  and peacetime throughout history  its rise to the tables where international peace and security are negotiated  represents a significant shift  this article continues the scholarly conversation about conflict related sexual violence and its emergence as a hot topic on academic  political  and activist agendas  specifically  we ask how and why criminal law constitutes the ultimately meaningful response to such violence  building on frame analysis  we address how the fight against conflict related sexual violence has become the fight against impunity  we examine what imageries of victims and perpetrators  causes and consequences key actors within interstate diplomacy and human rights advocacy evoke to drive this development  we argue that these narratives shape the political discourse on conflict related sexual violence  which may in turn influence the perceived political maneuverability in the face of such harms

 enough of this manure  why the epa needs to define the agricultural stormwater exemption to limit the  runoff  from the  italt it court this note challenges the alt court s restriction of the epa  s authority to regulate concentrated animal feeding operations  cafos  and proposes that the epa conduct a new rulemaking to address this issue  cafos pollute our nation s waterways with contaminated manure  damaging our environment and injuring public health  recognizing their potential to pollute  congress included cafos within the statutory definition of a point source in the clean water act in 1972  fifteen years later  congress amended the statute and exempted agricultural stormwater from the definition of a point source  controversy surrounded the application of the agricultural stormwater exemption to cafos until 2003  when the epa specified that the exemption only applied to precipitation based discharges from the land application area of a cafo when manure had been applied pursuant to prudent agricultural practices  unfortunately  in alt v  epa   industry capitalized on the ambiguity in the clean water act and secured a district court ruling expanding the agricultural stormwater exemption to include discharges outside the land application area  allowing cafos to further pollute our waterways  after providing the relevant history of cafo regulation  this note critiques the alt decision concluding that the court misinterpreted the agricultural stormwater exemption  finally  it argues that the epa should initiate a rulemaking and comprehensively define the agricultural stormwater exemption to prevent further environmental degradation and harm to human health  
 ensuring the right to education for roma children  an anglo swedish perspective access to public education systems has tended to be below normative levels where roma children are concerned  various long standing social  cultural  and institutional factors lie behind the lower levels of engagement and achievement of roma children in education  relative to many others  which is reflective of the general lack of integration of their families in mainstream society  the risks to roma children s educational interests are well recognized internationally  particularly at the european level  they have prompted a range of policy initiatives and legal instruments to protect rights and promote equality and inclusion  on top of the framework of international human rights and minority protections  nevertheless  states  autonomy in tailoring educational arrangements to their budgets and national policy agendas has contributed to considerable international variation in specific provision for roma children  as this article discusses  even between two socially liberal countries  the uk and sweden  with their well advanced welfare states and public systems of social support  there is a divergence in protection  one which underlines the need for a more consistent and positive approach to upholding the education rights and interests of children in this most marginalized and often discriminated against minority group  
 enterprise without entities scholars and practicing lawyers alike consider legal entities to be essential  who can imagine running a large business without using a business organization  such as a corporation or partnership  this article challenges conventional wisdom by showing that vast enterprises with millions of customers paying trillions of dollars often operate without any meaningful use of entities  this article introduces the reciprocal exchange  a type of insurance company that operates without any meaningful use of a legal entity  instead of obtaining insurance from a common nexus of contract  customers directly insure one another through a dense web of bilateral agreements  while often overlooked or conflated with mutual insurance companies  reciprocal exchanges include some of america s largest and best known insurance enterprises  this article explores how it is possible to run an international conglomerate with essentially no recourse to organizational law as it is normally conceived  and it then draws out the important implications of these findings  the viability of reciprocal exchanges stands as a powerful foil to the academic consensus that legal entities are somehow essential  while nevertheless validating the underlying logic that led scholars to elevate entities in the first place  
 entrenchment  incrementalism  and constitutional collapse entrenchment is fundamental to law  grand documents like the u s  constitution  and mundane ones like city and corporate charters  entrench themselves against change through supermajority rules and other mechanisms  entrenchment frustrates responsiveness  but it promotes stability  a rule of law virtue extolled for centuries  it does so through a straightforward channel  entrenched law is difficult to change  scholars have long understood this idea  which can be called the first status quo bias of entrenchment  this article shows that a second bias lurks  entrenchment makes changes that do take place incremental  as entrenchment deepens  the scope of potential change to law collapses on the status quo  to restate the idea  when we entrench law  we prevent change  at least for a time  and we confine any changes that do take place to small steps  this has implications for constitutional law  especially the debate about article v and the separation of powers  both of which shield the constitution from change more than scholars realize  it also illuminates several questions  especially in comparative constitutional law  such as why constitutions remain unpopular after amendment  finally  it generates a theory of constitutional failure  when voters  preferences evolve consistently in one direction  entrenched law eventually becomes as unstable as ordinary law  only less popular  thus  entrenchment buys neither stability nor responsiveness  because entrenchment confines legal change to incremental steps  amendment cannot correct the problem  this recasts questions of legal design in new light  and it may explain why some constitutions endure while others collapse

 environmental constitutionalism  a comparative study while 148 of the 196 national constitutions in effect today manifest some form of environmental constitutionalism  the fact that some states have not adopted such provisions suggests that their spread is not inexorable  this article investigates the factors which affect whether a state adopts environmental constitutionalism  by undertaking a historical analysis of those countries which have so amended their constitutions  it identifies the context in which the constitutional change takes place as a significant consideration  the context of constitutional change influences the amendment process  which is then opened up to a range of other factors  both external  learning persuasion  acculturation emulation  and internal  political leadership  public and sectoral engagement  constitutional ideology  national environmental damage   all of which are considered by examining previous efforts to enshrine environmental constitutionalism  the article concludes by highlighting four specific responses that are key to successful amendment processes  namely  capitalizing on crisis situations  ensuring that economic concerns are adequately addressed  leveraging the support of the public and politicians  and linking environmental protection to national values  
 environmental destruction in ecuador  crimes against humanity under the rome statute  on 16 march 2016  the prosecutor of the international criminal court  icc  rejected on jurisdictional grounds a victims  request to investigate a case of environmental destruction by chevron in ecuador  a little over a year later  on 15 september 2016  the prosecutor released a policy paper indicating that her office would consider hearing cases of environmental destruction  this article examines how the icc can prosecute environmental destruction as a crime against humanity under article 7 of the rome statute  it presents a survey of the potential jurisdictional and substantive issues of prosecuting environmental issues and uses the victims  request asking the prosecutor to investigate environmental destruction by chevron in the ecuadorian amazon as a backdrop  the article proceeds in three parts  firstly  it discusses the request by the victims in ecuador asking for the prosecutor to investigate  secondly  it sets out the basic jurisdictional framework of the icc and analyzes why the prosecutor rejected the victims  request  thirdly  it examines article 7 and concludes that while peacetime environmental destruction committed by a non state actor that results in a humanitarian atrocity can qualify as a crime against humanity  the factual circumstances alleged in the ecuadorian victims  request did not amount to a crime against humanity under the rome statute

 equal rights vs  special rights  rights discourses  framing  and lesbian and gay antidiscrimination policy in washington state this study argues that rights discourse influences heterosexual public opinion in washington state  we tested this through a survey experiment conducted in the 2011 washington poll  we broke interviewees into three groups  with each group exposed to a different frame  a pro lesbian and gay equal rights frame  an anti lesbian and gay special rights frame  and a control or no frame  immediately following the treatment  we asked interviewees if they agreed with a pro lesbian and gay policy  changing state antidiscrimination law to encompass those who identify as lesbian and gay  overall  this study concludes that a special rights frame dampens support among some while an equal rights frame has no effect  respondents who indicated that they were against same sex marriage even more strongly opposed altering antidiscrimination policy to include sexual orientation when confronted with an equal rights frame than when confronted with the special rights frame or no frame at all  
 escaping the clutches of eu competition law we review the recent attempts by the netherlands to stimulate private sustainability initiatives  early moves have been challenged as infringements of eu competition law  and the current plan looks as if it may not escape scrutiny under the eu competition rules or the internal market rules  a review of the ecj s case law  however  suggests that both the dutch competition authority and the commission take too narrow a view of the way in which private sustainability initiatives could be carried out  at the same time  the case law remains ambiguous and inconsistent  in the name of stimulating diverse approaches to achieve environmental goals across the eu  we argue for greater convergence of the way sustainability initiatives are assessed under eu competition law and internal market law  
 esthetics and methods in the study of sexual rights the study of sexuality has been and remains a seminal project for social   legal studies  this article utilizes the political esthetic theory of jacques ranciere in order to explore the dimensions of this project as an intervention in the field of sociolegal studies from the journal s inception to contemporary concerns  early studies of sexuality in the journal developed three methodological themes  law as deconstructable process  as consequential for the performative aspects of nonessentialized identities  and as potentially destabilized by highly mobile rights claiming  this article seeks to understand whether this unique agenda for the study of gender  sexuality  and law remains viable  it concludes that the nonessentialist fluidity of gender and sexuality which framed early approaches to the study of the consequences of rights and the relationship of sexual and gender identity requires renewed attention to the structures of race  colonialism  and imperialism enabling and enabled by contemporary queer critique  
 estimating judicial ideal points in the spanish supreme court  the case of administrative review this paper presents an estimation of ideal points for the justices of the supreme court of spain in the specific area of administrative review for the period 2000 2008  controlling for dissent suppression effort  the estimated ideal points allow us to identify political clusters in the supreme court which seem inconsistent with the formal and traditional views that a career judiciary is politically not strongly aligned  at the same time  we find evidence that confirms a trend favoring consensus and dissent avoidance   c  2017 elsevier inc  all rights reserved  
 ethics dilemmas in managing hunger strikes there is no agreement on how to manage hunger strikers  the health professionals called to intervene in a hunger strike are faced with a dilemma  commit themselves to good order and discipline or comply with best practices for providing healthcare  handling cases of hunger strikers confronts practitioners with the ethics dilemma of managing apparent intentional behavior that carries serious morbidity or mortality  but recognizing that hunger striking is a military and political tactic  and not a medical condition  the study by reeves  et  al  published in the journal enhances our understanding of the motives and psychology of hunger strikers  their analysis indicates that improving communication with custody administration and mitigating unnecessarily aversive housing environments can likely reduce the incidence of hunger strikes

 european crises of legally constituted public power  from the  law of corporatism  to the  law of governance  the  turn to corporatism  in the interwar period implied an erosion of the fragile institutionalisation of legally constituted public power due to its suspension of the legal infrastructure of society and the concomitant breakdown of the distinction between the public and private realms of society  the dual  trans   national re constitution of western europe in the years immediately after the second world war  which the european integration process was an integrated part of  successfully remedied this development  however  over the last decades  europe has experienced a  turn to governance   which also implies an erosion of the distinction between the public and private realms  and increasingly challenges the normative integrity and functional capacity of law  this development has been further reinforced by the new post crisis legal and institutional architecture of the eu as it implies the emergence of a  dual union  partly based upon formality and partly upon informality and an increased suspension of open ended democratic decision making  
 european federalism  pitfalls and possibilities the purpose of this article is to show that federalism provides a better understanding of what the eu is  the nature of the challenges facing it  and the realm of possible solutions than do alternative conceptions such as multilevel governance  first  some important distortions about the eu and federalism in the eu studies literature need to be cleared up  before developing a new federal conception of the eu  that of a  poly cephalous  or multi headed federation  a poly cephalous federation is not only deeply contested  it is a highly unstable system  in particular when facing the types of challenges that the eu has faced since the global economic crisis of 2008  in the final section  the article looks at a full fledged pluralistic federation with poly cephalous traits  namely canada that  since the 1980s  has greatly modified its poly cephalous features with democratic effects  the article identifies a set of lessons for the eu from canada s experience

 european regulatory private law going global  the case of product governance the article claims that contract law principles are being used by transnational financial regulation to set a world wide  proto normative framework regulating intra firm processes  this practice comes close to the european regulatory private law  erpl  phenomenon already employed by the eu lawmaker in quite technical fields  such as banking and financial services law  after an overview explaining what it is meant by erpl  the article discusses the new product governance rules under the market in financial instrument directive ii  which may be viewed as the most recent example of erpl  the article then provides a description of the normative production of the international organization of securities commissions  iosco   also regarding product governance rules  the result of the author s analysis seems to suggest that iosco has paved the way for a european approach to product governance which  overall  is coherent with the erpl theory

 euthanasia in belgium  legal  historical and political review this article describes and evaluates the belgian euthanasia experience by considering its practice and policy  both before and after the formal decriminalisation of euthanasia in 2002  the pre legal practice of euthanasia  the evolution of euthanasia legislation  criticism of this legislation  the influence of politics  and later changes to the 2002 act on euthanasia are discussed  as well as the subject of euthanasia of minors and the matter of organ procurement  it is argued that the belgian euthanasia experience is characterised by political expedition  and that the 2002 act and its later amendments suffer from practical and conceptual flaws  illegal euthanasia practices remain a live concern in belgium  something which nations who are seeking to decriminalise euthanasia should consider  
 evaluating negative forensic evidence  when do jurors treat absence of evidence as evidence of absence  two jury simulation experiments tested participants  sensitivity to variations in the probative value of a piece of negative forensic evidence  failure to find gunshot residue  gsr  on a defendant alleged to have fired a gun  experiment 1 found that if no gsr was detected  juries  n 115  of undergraduates were appropriately less likely to convict a criminal defendant when the probability of detecting gsr was high than when it was low  participants were unaffected by contextualizing expert testimony that emphasized either the value of the negative evidence for making inductive inferences or that the negative evidence was inconclusive for making deductions  experiment 2 used a sample of venire jurors  n 420  and manipulated the probability of detecting gsr  0 percent  50 percent  60 percent  90 percent  or 100 percent  given that a gun was fired  consistent with the first experiment  venire jurors were more likely to convict when the probability of detection was 0 percent or 50 percent than when it was 100 percent  but verdicts did not differ between the middle groups  this pattern of results suggests that jurors may evaluate negative evidence according to a fairly crude metricgiving it no weight if the probability of detection is zero  a great deal of weight if the probability of detection is 100 percent  and moderate weight if the probability of detection is somewhere in between  
 evaluating the evaluators  transitional justice and the contest of values despite an increase in scholarly efforts to evaluate transitional justice  tj  programmes  there is little agreement over what tj is  what effects it could be expected to have or how tj mechanisms should be judged  this article contributes to the literature on tj evaluation by showing how differences in understanding of the nature and value of the  justice  in tj affect what is evaluated and how findings are interpreted  the article parses the values inherent in tj evaluations  retributive  restorative and transformative justice  valuable for intrinsic or instrumental reasons  in order to think through the ways in which different value orientations lead to different appraisals  a broad sample of literature on the tj programme in sierra leone is analyzed according to the value orientations it tends towards  the analysis finds that evaluations of sierra leonean tj can be found displaying each of the six value orientations  with no agreement about the success of the tj programme from within orientations  let alone across them  additionally  it is argued that scholars and researchers are rarely explicit about their orientations  and there is insufficient consideration of the political implications of different value positions for prescriptions for future tj programmes  
 evaluation of different methods for dna extraction from human burnt bones and the generation of genetic profiles for identification bone exposure to heat in the presence of moisture breaks the phosphodiester bonds of the backbone  leaving sheared dna in bone cells  this also limits the possibility of generating a complete profile of the victim  with the increasing incidence of fire outbreaks over the past few years  a paradigm shift to establish identity has been observed  from morphological identification of victims to str profiling  for this study  10 bone samples were taken from burnt human bodies that were recovered from different fire outbreak scenes  the dna from these burnt human tissues was isolated using four different extraction methods  the organic extraction method  the total demineralisation method  the qiagen kit method  and the chelex extraction method  str profiles of victims were generated on a genetic analyser using an ampflstr identifiler  r  plus kit and analysed on gene mapper id x  dna isolated from bones using the total demineralisation extraction method and organic extraction method was of the highest quality due to the efficient removal of inhibitors  dna obtained using these two methods successfully generated the str profiles of the victims  the quality of isolated dna obtained through the qiagen kit was comparatively low  but str profiles of the victims were successfully generated  the chelex kit failed to extract good quality dna of high quantity from the burnt bones  encountering inhibition in all samples at varying degrees  this study concludes that total demineralisation and the qiagen kit are sophisticated and reliable methods to obtain a good yield of dna from burnt human bones  which can be used for the identification of victims  
 evaluation of the capacity to marry clinical and forensic evaluators are often faced with the task of answering unique questions about capacity and competency  one seldom discussed question is that of an individual s capacity to marry  this article uses a case example as a framework for discussing the challenges of evaluating an individual s capacity to marry  we will set the background with legal history and then provide guidance for making this type of assessment  
 ex turpi causa  reformation not revolution seldom has an area of law been so afflicted with uncertainties and contradictions as the illegality defence and rarely have judicial opinions been so sharply divided as in the supreme court decision in patel v mirza where nine justices examined the issue of the correct approach to the illegality defence  six of them endorsed the range of factors  approach  whereas three condemned it  this paper defends the majority s approach against the minority s criticisms but argues that refinements should be made to it in order to address the uncertainty that may arise from its application  
 examining high rates of preventable maternal mortality in kenya  could provisional measures be an effective tool to guarantee safe pregnancy  this article analyses the barriers that expectant mothers face in accessing appropriate  quality medical services in kenya  and investigates the potential for the regional african human rights adjudicator to use provisional measures  pms  to protect expectant mothers  the article aims to explore whether pms adopted by the african commission on human and peoples  rights could be an appropriate legal tool to secure protection for expectant mothers who are dealing with obstacles in obtaining the medical services that they need  in that regard  this contribution suggests that the situation of certain expectant mothers in kenya meets the two necessary conditions to grant pms under the african human rights system  that the situation is urgent and the measures are necessary to prevent irreparable damage  it suggests that  following the tendency of other international human rights bodies  the commission has the potential to play a relevant role in the context of maternal mortality  
 examining jurors  applying conversation analysis to voir dire in capital cases  a first look scholarship about racial disparities in jury selection is extensive  but the data about how parties examine potential jurors in actual trials is limited  this study of jury selection for 792 potential jurors across twelve randomly selected north carolina capital cases uses conversation analysis to examine the process that produces decisions about who serves on juries  to examine how race influences conversations in voir dire  we adapted the roter interaction analysis system  a widely used framework for understanding the dynamics of patient clinician communication during clinical encounters  to the legal setting for the first time  this method allows us to document the conversational dynamics of actual questioning of potential jurors that precedes the decision to seat or strike a juror  or to excuse her for cause  our preliminary analysis of this uniquely rich archival data suggests ways in which the discourse of jury selection varies by race  and provides the foundation for future work looking at the ways in which the evaluation of fitness for jury service itself is skewed and contributes to racial disparities in jury selection  
 excessive pricing of off patent pharmaceuticals  hatch it or ratchet  there is growing concern over the pharmaceutical industry s ability to set and raise drug prices as it sees fit  the price of a drug that has not been protected by a patent for decades can suddenly increase or  ratchet  as much as 10 000   this note identifies the problem of ratcheting drug prices and considers whether these abrupt changes in drug prices derive from a longstanding problem inherent in the united states  pharmaceutical regulatory regime  it then considers the most commonly suggested mechanism for countering high drug prices stimulating competition in the pharmaceutical market but ultimately concludes that focusing solely on increasing competition constructs an overly simplistic view of ratcheting drug prices  in order to find an effective solution to unexpected increases in drug prices  this note evaluates a small subset of pharmaceuticals that have recently undergone a sudden price increase and separates the ratcheting events into two categories   1  those that occur as a result of natural deviations in the market  and  2  those that occur due to business tactics that take advantage of vulnerabilities in the drug market  it concludes that under this categorization  antitrust law may provide an effective solution specifically directed at ratcheting events of the second category those driven by anticompetitive behavior  
 excusable consent in duress while the illegitimate pressure theory provides a more satisfactory theoretical basis for duress in contract law than the overborne will theory  it insufficiently addresses why a victim who has given deliberated consent should be excused from contractual responsibility  the paper proposes that the additional element of excusable consent  enhances the current analytical framework  first  by recognising that the law makes value judgments of both the threatening party s actions and the victim s response  secondly  by lightening the burden of the illegitimate pressure element and providing it greater focus  and  thirdly  by providing a better fit for considerations such as no practical alternatives  that strain the existing framework  
 executing humanity  legal consciousness and capital punishment in the united states  1915 1940 from the 1830s to the 1930s  elites across the united states increasingly privatized executions and standardized execution protocols  these changes reflected and reinforced a more bureaucratic image of the state as an abstract entity run by professionals operating in rule bound roles rather than particular actors governing in an unsystematic way  after this period of change  the aesthetics of the execution ceremony had so thoroughly changed that the death penalty had the potential to inspire critiques of the modern state as cold  detached  and callous  it rarely did  however  changes to state killing threatened to diminish the recognition of human dignity in the nation s execution chambers were countered by melodramatic popular renderings of executions that preserved their sacred  traditional character  toward the end of this period of change  from 1915 to 1940  playwrights  screenwriters  and journalists maintained executions as events in which the humanity of the state that killed and the condemned who died was constantly foregrounded  even as execution modes and protocols became rationalized and machine like  reflecting this ethos  images of condemned men in the nation s collective imagination became disproportionately white  
 exploring the agency of africa in climate change negotiations  the case of redd emerging climate change regimes  such as the mechanism for reducing emissions from deforestation and forest degradation  redd    are increasingly aiming to engage developing countries such as those in africa  in sustainable development through carbon markets  the contribution of african countries to global climate negotiations determines how compatible the negotiated rules could be with the existing socioeconomic and policy circumstances of african countries  the aim of this paper is to explore the agency of africa  african states  in the global climate change negotiations and discuss possible implications for implementing these rules using redd  as a case study  drawing on document analysis and semi structured expert interviews  our findings suggest that although african countries are extensively involved in the implementation of redd  interventions  the continent has a weak agency on the design of the global redd  architecture  this weak agency results from a number of factors including the inability of african countries to send large and diverse delegations to the negotiations as well lack of capacity to generate and transmit research evidence to the global platform  african countries also perceive themselves as victims of climate change who should be eligible for support rather than sources of technological solutions  again  africa s position is fragmented across negotiation coalitions which weakens the continent s collective influence on the redd  agenda  this paper discusses a number of implementation deficits which could result from this weak agency  these include concerns about implementation capacity and a potential lack of coherence between redd  rules and existing policies in african countries  these findings call for a rethink of pathways to enhancing africa s strategies in engaging in multilateral climate change negotiations  especially if climate change regimes specifically targeted at developing countries are to be effective  
 expressive law  social norms  and social groups to understand how law works outside of sanctions or direct coercion  we must first appreciate that law does not generally influence individual behavior in a vacuum  devoid of social context  instead  the way in which people interact with law is usually mediated by group life  in contrast to the instrumental view that assumes law operates on autonomous individuals by providing a set of incentives  the social groups view holds that a person s attitude and behavior regarding any given demand of law are generally products of the interaction of law  social influence  and motivational goals that are shaped by that person s commitments to specific in groups  law can work expressively  not so much by shaping independent individual attitudes as by shaping group values and norms  which in turn influence individual attitudes  in short  the way in which people interact with law is mediated by group life  
 eyes of the law  a visual turn in socio legal studies  a number of sub disciplines have emerged in recent years with the specific goal of examining the visual dynamics of academic fields of inquiry  the turn to the visual masks a multitude of meanings about the significance of the image  ranging from new ways of defining a field of inquiry  to what constitutes legitimate sources for research or discussions of image production or visual prompts as a data collection method  this article asks what it means for socio legal scholars to engage with the image and the opportunity it might provide us with to see what law looks like from the perspective of law s subjects  these might include art installations in galleries  images of the places where justice is administered as well as photographs created by those who are subjected to legal regulation  in addition to a written essay i offer up three visual essays which can be read and contemplated with or without the written text which accompanies them

 family  law  assemblages  new modes of being  legal  this article advances a new model for family law to address emerging non conventional family formations  particularly between parents and children  we contend that the conventional model of kinship categories as static  predefined statuses should be replaced with a model whereby the state accommodates kinship categories the law users themselves produce within their fluid and nomadic family assemblages and that they actively revise when negotiating state recognition  we claim that this model would better reflect and govern the emerging kinship system  we corroborate this by drawing on insights from family research that takes issue with the fragmentation of kinship  particularly the fragmentation of motherhood  we then elaborate on a conception of state recognition as the capacity to trace connections and identify normative frameworks  one that valorizes the self organizing force of social practices but at the same time holds onto the filtering role of the state  
 federal preemption of local right to work ordinances conservative organizations such as the heritage foundation and the american legislative exchange council  alec  are promoting a national campaign encouraging municipal entities  such as counties and cities  to pass right to work  rtw  ordinances  the litigation concerning these ordinances is being followed closely across the nation because some view these ordinances as a necessary economic development tool  while others view them as an attempt to create havoc in labor relations and undermine union power  but are these local ordinances preempted by a federal statute  the national labor relations act  nlra or act   that is the legal issue currently pending in the federal courts  this article answers the question with a resounding  yes   the article contributes two distinct benefits to the negligible and outdated academic discussion of this important topic  first  the article is an in depth exploration of nlra preemption  without consideration of state law  which permits the issue to be treated more completely than ever before  second  it provides a modern view of an issue that has been largely ignored for twenty five years  the article explains the various forms of union security that employers and unions have historically bargained for  emphasizing that under current federal law no employee is required to join a union  each employee may instead pay a fee in an amount that simply covers the cost to represent that employee  the article then explains the broad preemptive effect of the nlra  which ensures uniformity in labor relations  the article discusses how two preemption doctrines require an expert board to determine labor relations issues  foster predictability in bargaining  and maintain industrial peace  the article next introduces a narrow exception to the comprehensive federal preemption of states  ability to regulate in the area of labor relations the ability of states to pass right to work laws  the necessary background having been covered  the article then turns to the issue of local right to work  lrtw  ordinances  to support the conclusion that these local right to work ordinances are preempted by the nlra  the article first applies the two preemption doctrines to the enactment of these ordinances  the article then explains how every court to address the issue  except one  has found the ordinances preempted and how labor law experts  including the vice president of the national right to work committee  agree the ordinances are preempted  next  the article examines the language of the nlra and the legislative history behind the passage of the section of the nlra permitting states to pass right to work laws  both the language and the legislative history of the statute support the conclusion that the local right to work ordinances are preempted  finally  the article compares and contrasts the nlra s broad preemption of local right to work ordinances to schemes of preemption under other federal statutes  the article concludes by explaining that  given the federal preemption of local right to work ordinances  expending municipal funds to enact such ordinances is a poor use of taxpayer funds  and by suggesting areas for further research  
 federal review of state criminal convictions  a structural approach to adequacy doctrine modern state postconviction review systems feature procedural labyrinths so complicated and confusing that indigent defendants have no realistic prospect of complying with the rules  when defendants predictably fail to navigate these mazes  state and federal courts deem their claims procedurally defaulted and refuse to consider those claims on their merits  as a result  systemic violations of criminal procedure rights like the right to effective counsel persist without judicial correction  but the law contains a tool that  if properly adapted  could bring these systemic problems to the attention of federal courts  procedural adequacy  procedural adequacy doctrine gives federal courts the power to ignore procedural defaults and declare state procedural rules inadequate when those rules unduly burden defendants  abilities to assert violations of their federal rights  and unlike the more commonly invoked cause and prejudice doctrine  which excuses default on the theory that a defendant s unusual circumstances justify an exception to the rules  procedural adequacy doctrine allows courts to question the legitimacy of the state procedural regimes themselves  procedural adequacy doctrine can therefore catalyze reform in a way that cause and prejudice cannot  for procedural adequacy litigation to catalyze reform  however  it must be adapted to modern circumstances in one crucial respect  historically  procedural adequacy doctrine focused on cases involving the deliberate manipulation of individual rules  today  what is needed is a structural approach to adequacy  one that would consider how the interaction of multiple procedural rules unfairly burdens federal rights  such a structural approach to adequacy is consistent with the doctrine s original purposes and is the mostsensible way to apply procedural adequacy under current conditions  litigants should accordingly deploy a structural approach to procedural adequacy doctrine and use it to stop states from burying systemic constitutional violations in complicated procedural labyrinths  
 federalism and the challenge of applying international human rights law against child marriage in africa federalism presents a dilemma for the implementation of international human rights law in those african states that operate federal constitutions  central governments in these states enjoy international legal personality  make treaties and represent their states as parties to those treaties  yet internal legislative competence over some issues regulated by treaty is commonly shared between central and regional governments  consequently  while central governments bear responsibility for transforming international standards into national law  challenges arise in areas such as the protection of children from child marriage  where they lack exclusive national legislative competence  how have these states managed to implement international law without violating their own constitutions  applying a comparative approach  this article argues that african federal states have employed two main models to overcome the dilemma  neither of which has been totally effective  drawing lessons from federal states outside africa  the article suggests other mechanisms to perfect africa s two main models  
 finding reprieve  should the global movement against capital punishment embrace china s suspended death sentence as a model for other retentionist states to emulate  this article examines the somewhat paradoxical relationship between china s unique innovation  the suspended death sentence  sihuan zhidu   and the aim of global abolition of capital punishment  under china s criminal law  a two year reprieve may be imposed together with the death sentence if the court does not find immediate execution to be necessary  and  depending on the convict s behavior during the reprieve  the death sentence may be commuted to life or fixed term imprisonment  the suspended death sentence may serve as a model for remaining retentionist states to emulate in their movement towards abolition because it is a potentially powerful tool of partial abolition which allows the state to increasingly isolate the use of the death penalty to the most serious crimes and gradually reduce the number of executions  however  implementing the suspended death sentence  in its current form  in retentionist states may conversely legitimate the use of the death penalty for the worst criminals who are regarded as most deserving of such punishment  and impede progress towards abolition  
 five solutions to the rems patent problem two principles collide in the pharmaceutical industry  on the one hand  the u s  food and drug administration   fda   approves potentially dangerous drugs under risk evaluation and mitigation strategies   rems   programs when a drug s benefits outweigh its risks  but on the other hand  brand firms can prevent generic competition by patenting these programs  rems patents  which claim compliance with fda imposed rems programs  pose two problems one procedural  the other substantive  first  current practice is to list rems patents in the orange book even though such listings may be invalid  with this conduct allowing the brand to obtain an automatic 30month stay of generic approval  second  because a rems program appears on a product s label and generics must copy that label  rems patents threaten generics with claims of induced infringement  we offer five solutions to these problems  first  we target brands  listings of rems patents in the orange book  proposing that generic firms sued for infringement file counterclaims to delist rems patents and that the fda issue guidance making clear that rems patents cannot be listed  second  we suggest more rigorous scrutiny of rems patents in the courts and at the u s  patent and trademark office  third  we apply the supreme court s four factor ebay test to conclude that courts should award damages rather than injunctions in cases of infringement  fourth  we suggest that congress amend the food and drug administration amendments act of 2007 to mitigate the effects of rems patents  and fifth  we recommend that  similar to the treatment of tax strategy patents in the america invents act  congress deem rems patents to fall within the prior art  
 for whom does deterrence affect behavior  identifying key individual differences deterrence threats are essential mechanisms for affecting behavior  yet they are often ineffective  the literature is beginning to consider individual differences underlying differential susceptibility to deterrence  the present study sampled 223 adults from amazon mechanical turk and used an experimental cheating paradigm to examine the role of 3 individual differences  including morality  self control  and rule orientation  underlying differential susceptibility to deterrence  the results indicate that deterrence threats may be more influential for people who have low moral disengagement  who possess more self control  or who are more rule oriented  these findings indicate that important individual differences underlie susceptibility to deterrence  
 forceful self help and private voice  how schauer and mcadams exaggerate a state s ability to monopolize violence and expression frederick schauer s the force of law  2015  and richard mcadams s the expressive powers of law  2015  are noteworthy contributions  however  both authors exaggerate the importance of law  as opposed to other means of social control  schauer largely omits the role that self help measures  ranging from negative gossip to violent self defense  play in deterring misconduct  contrary to max weber  the state in practice cannot monopolize the legitimate use of physical force  mcadams valuably analyzes law s potentially expressive effects  he might have devoted more attention  however  to identifying the contexts in which state speech tends to be more salient than private speech  such as a statement by the pope or another esteemed private pundit

 forgotten evidence  a mixed methods study of why sexual assault kits  saks  are not submitted for dna forensic testing throughout the united states  hundreds of thousands of sexual assault kits  saks   also termed  rape kits   have not been submitted by the police for forensic dna testing  dna evidence can help sexual assault investigations and prosecutions by identifying offenders  revealing serial offenders through dna matches across cases  and exonerating those who have been wrongly accused  in this article  we describe a 5 year action research project conducted with 1 city that had large numbers of untested saks detroit  michigan and our examination into why thousands of rape kits in this city were never submitted for forensic dna testing  this mixed methods study combined ethnographic observations and qualitative interviews to identify stakeholders  perspectives as to why rape kits were not routinely submitted for testing  then  we quantitatively examined whether these factors may have affected police practices regarding sak testing  as evidenced by predictable changes in sak submission rates over time  chronic resource scarcity only partially explained why the organizations that serve rape victims the police  crime lab  prosecution  and victim advocacy could not test all rape kits  investigate all reported sexual assaults  and support all rape survivors  sak submission rates significantly increased once criminal justice professionals in this city had full access to the fbi dna forensic database combined dna index system  codis   but even then  most saks were still not submitted for dna testing  building crime laboratories  capacities for dna testing and training police on the utility of forensic evidence and best practices in sexual assault investigations can help remedy  and possibly prevent  the problem of untested rape kits  
 formations of buddhist constitutionalism in south and southeast asia from a subfield focused mainly on secular constitutions in anglophone and or european settings  the study of religion and constitutional law has gradually shifted its attention to religiously preferential constitutions in north africa  the middle east and parts of asia  while this shift has produced a rich literature on islam and constitutional law  it has almost entirely neglected buddhism  this neglect presents a significant problem for scholars of comparative constitutional law because  as this article contends  some of the most important legal projects in south and southeast asia have been projects of buddhist constitutionalism  attempts to use written constitutions and other basic laws to organize power in ways that protect and preserve buddhist teachings and institutions  especially the institution of buddhist monasticism  the sangha  by looking at the premodern roots of buddhist constitutionalism and examining its distinctive formations in sri lanka and thailand  this article explains how and why this particular form of religious constitutionalism has come to influence politics and law in contemporary south and southeast asia  
 fostering legal cynicism through immigration detention every year  tens of thousands of noncitizens in removal proceedings are held and processed through an expanding web of immigration detention facilities across the united states  the use of immigration detention is expected to dramatically increase under the trump administration s mass deportation policy  i argue that this civil confinement system may serve a critical socio legal function that has escaped the attention of policymakers  scholars  and the public alike  using extensive original data on long term immigrant detainees  i explore how immigration detention might function as a site of legal socialization that helps to promote or reinforce widespread legal cynicism among immigrant detainees  this legal cynicism is characterized by the belief that the legal system is punitive despite its purported administrative function  legal rules are inscrutable by design  and legal outcomes are arbitrary  these findings advance the study of democracy  legitimacy  and the rule of law in a number of ways  first  this article offers a new way of conceptualizing the relationship between the state and individuals subject to immigration enforcement  this reconceptualization recognizes noncitizens not as passive objects of state control  but as moral agents who are capable of normative judgments about the law and legal authorities  second  this article provides a fuller and more nuanced perspective on immigration detention s societal impacts  which are likely to be far more wide reaching and long lasting than commonly assumed  for example  immigrant detainees  as individuals embedded in domestic and transnational networks  have the potential to widely disseminate deference and trust  or alternatively cynicism and delegitimating beliefs  about the u s  legal system and authorities  together  these contributions underscore the urgency and importance of understanding the socialization function of law and legal systems for noncitizens in an era of increasing cross border movement and migration control  
 framing and mapping the governance barriers to energy upgrades in flats it is important for climate change mitigation  and to address fuel poverty  that multi owned properties  mops  containing flats are refurbished with energy and carbon saving technologies  energy upgrades   this article explains how the ownership and management  governance  arrangements of mops can limit or inhibit energy upgrades  a building governance framework is adopted to examine the energy efficiency gap in mops through two lenses  an organisational lens that focuses on complex decision making  and a  law and technology  lens that explores the role of title deeds  although the problem is particularly acute in england and wales  where flats are sold on a leasehold basis  there is a broader issue whenever there is co ownership of buildings containing apartments  and policy measures designed to improve energy efficiency in homes must pay particular attention to the complexity created by governance arrangements  
 freedom and generalisation both inside and outside the courtroom  we commonly infer facts about individuals by using generalisations about how similar people tend to behave in similar situations  however  some types of generalisation seem intuitively objectionable  eg using the high rate of crimes involving illegal firearms in a certain neighbourhood to support the conviction of an individual resident in a crime involving an illegal firearm   this article seeks to propose a new approach to the use of generalisations in order to identify which uses are objectionable and to explain why this is the case  this new approach seeks to connect the problem of generalisation to the issue of free will  the crux of the argument is that using some types of generalisation requires presupposing that the individual s behaviour was determined by a certain causal factor which renders such behaviour unfree  yet  in some contexts  most importantly in criminal proceedings  it is necessary to presuppose the exact opposite  that the individual is free to determine her own behaviour  using these generalisations in such contexts is objectionable because it involves contradicting presuppositions about the individual s behaviour  
 freedom of speech and the criminal law because the free speech clause limits government power to enact penal statutes  it has a close relationship to american criminal law  this article explores that relationship at a time when a fast growing  decriminalization movement  has taken hold across the nation  at the heart of the article is the idea that free speech law has developed in ways that have positioned the supreme court to use that law to impose significant new limits on the criminalization of speech  more particularly  this article claims that the court has developed three distinct decision making strategies for decriminalizing speech based on constitutional principles  the first involves judicial blocking that is  declaring some speech controls altogether out of bounds  whether they utilize either criminal or civil sanctions  the second involves judicial channeling that is  requiring that government regulation of some types of speech must take the form of civil law  and not criminal law  restraints  the third involves judicial narrowing that is  interpreting criminal statutes to restrict their reach and thus frustrate potential government prosecutions in light of free expression values  this article identifies concrete ways in which the court might deploy all three strategies to support the decriminalization of expressive conduct in the future  with regard to such topics as fighting words  hostile audience speech  infliction of emotional distress  mens rea rules  speech law  tortification   content discrimination  individualized warning requirements  hybrid rights analysis  and more  
 friends you can trust  a signaling theory of interest group litigation before the us supreme court how do interest groups influence u s  supreme court justices to vote in favor of their preferred outcomes  following prior research on the influence of the solicitor general  we develop and expand on the signaling theory of interest group influence via amicus curie briefs  we argue that an interest group s ideological reputation and the nature of the ideological signal it sends in its brief both function as powerful heuristics that convey information to the justices depending on the justices  own ideological preferences  when an organization files an amicus brief advocating for an outcome seemingly contrary to its traditional preferences  i e   an unexpected signal   this signal should be more noticeable and credible than a signal in accordance with a group s conventional views  i e   an expected signal   however  unexpected signals should have greater influence on justices who share the brief filer s preferences  we test our signaling theory on the terms from 1991 through 2002  we find that unexpected signals  but not expected signals  are associated with supreme court voting  and the influence of unexpected signals appears to be particularly strong among justices who share the ideological preferences of the brief filer  
 from  prisoner s dilemma  to reluctance to use judicial discretion  the enemies of cooperation in european cross border cases this article will focus on articles 41 44 of the recast european insolvency regulation  regulation 2015 848  and the dynamic of cooperation and communication between courts and insolvency practitioners  two main ideas will be maintained  the first is that cooperation requires a legal framework which is certain otherwise  prescriptions imposing duties of cooperation and communication might produce  prisoner s dilemmas  and  paradoxically  unwillingness to cooperate  the second idea is that prescriptions imposing duties of cooperation and communication have an intrinsic open texture this characteristic ontologically requires courts and insolvency practitioners to make choices between different rulings and activities  these findings imply that while interventions  both at european level and at national level  aiming at making the legal framework more certain are always welcome  interventions aiming at better specifying contents and extension of duties of cooperation and communication could be to a certain extent useless and even counterproductive  copyright  c  2017 insol international and john wiley   sons  ltd  
 from command and control to collaboration and deference  the transformation of auto safety regulation created in 1966 primarily as a rulemaking body empowered to force the technology of motor vehicle safety  the national highway safety administration  nhtsa  had by the mid 1980s largely abandoned rulemaking in favor of aggressively recalling defective vehicles  devastating losses in pre enforcement judicial review of rules combined with judicial embrace of recalls to drive that first period adaptation  congressional reaction mimicked the signals from the courts  and the reagan administration s regulatory reform and relief programs of the 1980s further solidified nhtsa s rulemaking retreat  prodded by congressional mandates  beginning in 1991  but largely of 21st century origin  nhtsa returned to rulemaking in the last two decades  but in a radically revised form  rather than forcing new technologies  the agency has largely required the diffusion of technologies already in widespread use technologies that may well have reached near universal deployment in the absence of the agency s efforts  as the protracted airbag case makes clear  deferring to industry s priorities and timetable in this manner may well have cost lives  but the transformation also largely insulated nhtsa from judicial and political challenge  industry had little reason to contest rules requiring technologies it was already implementing  and courts were unlikely to invalidate such measures in any event  motor vehicle fatality rates have indeed decreased dramatically since nhtsa s formation  yet the agency s own research suggests that much of that reduction would have occurred anyway  due to factors other than safety technology  in the meantime  recalls  which have no demonstrable systemic effect on motor vehicle safety  have continued at increasingly high  sometimes astounding  levels  and have been combined with consumer information campaigns  promotion of motorists  behavior modification efforts  non binding  guidance  documents  and agency industry voluntary agreements  to round out nhtsa s emerging model of cooperative regulation  whether or not this strategy has substantial effects in promoting motor vehicle safety  nhtsa s accommodating posture has resulted in congressional and omb approval and industry acceptance without litigation  this article describes the evolution of motor vehicle safety regulation and interprets the agency s transformation as an almost perfect adaptation to a legal culture that is skeptical of ex ante coercive restraints on individual or firm conduct and accepting of post hoc compensatory or punitive action when that conduct fails to satisfy broad social norms  and that process of adaptation is very much a work in progress  today  nhtsa finds itself in a world that was unimaginable in 1966  then  it was assumed that safety did not sell  that motorists  misbehavior was intractable and accidents hence unavoidable  and that optimal innovation  in particular to make vehicles more  crashworthy   required government to step in  fast forward to the present  it appears that safety  at least in some forms  does sell  motorists are at last buckling up in response to mandatory seat belt use laws  and highly automated   self driving   vehicles  combined with smart infrastructure  promise a near accident free utopia  meanwhile  innovation is advancing at a torrid pace  as the automotive  advanced electronics  and software sectors converge  these changes in nhtsa s operational context have reinforced the agency s rulemaking reticence and promoted a preference for statements of  policy   that the agency asserts are non binding yet potentially enforceable by means of recalls  the agency s attempts to straddle the murky legal boundary between guidance and rulemaking may well be the next arena in which it encounters the constraints of legal culture a culture that defines the conditions of legitimate administrative action  but not the details of its implementation  
 from cyber norms to cyber rules  re engaging states as law makers several indicators point to a crisis at the heart of the emerging area of international cyber security law  first  proposals for binding international treaties by leading stakeholders  including china and russia  have been met with little enthusiasm by other states  and are generally seen as having limited prospects of success  second  states are extremely reluctant to commit themselves to specific interpretations of controversial legal questions and thus to express their cyber opinio juris  third  instead of interpreting or developing rules  state representatives seek refuge in the more ambiguous term norms   this article argues that the reluctance of states to engage in international law making has left a power vacuum  lending credence to claims that international law fails in addressing modern challenges posed by rapid technological development  in response  several non state driven norm making initiatives have sought to fill the void  including microsoft s cyber norms proposals and the tallinn manual project  the article then contends that this emerging body of non binding norms presents states with a critical window of opportunity to reclaim a central law making position  similar to historical precedents including the development of legal regimes for antarctica and nuclear safety  whether the supposed crisis will lead to the demise of inter state cyberspace governance or a recalibration of legal approaches will thus be decided in the near future  states should assume a central role if they want to ensure that the existing power vacuum is not exploited in a way that would upset their ability to achieve strategic and political goals  
 from hercules to pareto  of bathos  proportionality  and eu law this article is a critique of the legal reasoning of the court of justice of the european union  cjeu  in its free movement case law  which relies mainly on the principle of proportionality  the court initially presents free movement cases as involving fundamental clashes between conflicting considerations of the highest order  most often between market freedoms and non economic interests  including the preservation of the competences of member states  fundamental rights  national policies and eu wide values   and thus frames its role as that of a balance a truly herculean task  however  the court does not actually solve these cases by balancing  instead  it  implicitly  resorts to an alternative  technocratic framework  through which it reduces the cases to technical issues of pure fact and  on the basis of pareto efficiency  limits itself to weeding out objectively superfluous regulations  the reasoning of the court is thus characterized by a certain form of bathos  it abruptly and radically shifts from a herculean balancing of values framework to a seemingly innocuous and purely factual review of pareto efficiency  it ambitiously  and yet awkwardly  combines an exalted appeal to values with the objectivity and irresistible innocuousness of efficiency review  it is nevertheless doubtful whether the court s argumentative structure is at all persuasive  value statements are reduced to declamatory devices of no operational importance  while the court s recourse to pareto efficiency only serves to hide the  obviously  controversial implications of its free movement case law  
 from market fragmentation to market integration in the eu insurance industry  can eu regulation unify what is separate at birth  insurance regulation at eu level dates back to the 1970s and has always been intended to create a harmonised legal framework to incentivise freedom of establishment and freedom to provide services  however  despite considerable secondary law opposing the regulatory barriers between member states and the general applicability of eu competition rules  fragmentation and a low level of market integration are a constant in the insurance markets  in the more recent european sector regulation  the increasing focus on consumer protection and financial stability seems to predominate over the integration of domestic markets in an open and competitive european market  adopting a horizontal methodological approach  this article aims to provide a critical assessment of the impact of current eu insurance regulation on the low levels of competition and market integration  
 from transconstitutionalism to transdemocracy this article relates to the author s project  transdemocracy   it starts with a discussion of  transconstitutionalism  and its limits  transconstitutionalism concerns the fact that multiple legal orders of the same or different kind are simultaneously involved with the same constitutional issue or case  i e  issue or case concerning basic rights or legal limitation and control of political power  constitutional problems  thus go beyond the state and entangle several legal orders  although no new constitution arises in this context  the article points out the limits of transconstitutionalism in an asymmetric world society so as to seek new alternatives beyond it  two alternatives are considered  post constitutionalism  which demands transcendence of today s world society and thus negate constitutionalism in general  and transdemocracy  which is rather immanent to our social formation and claims to be complementary to transconstitutionalism  because the author prefers the second alternative  the article begins to outline an approach to transdemocracy that goes across state boundaries and beyond  we the people   that is popular sovereignty  in order to emphasize the sustainable responsiveness for other peoples in the same world society  it is a question of sustainability of democracy  in this context  the author intends to develop an ecological approach to democracy with the background of niklas luhmann s systems theory  but from a heterodox  critical perspective  
 from wednesbury unreasonableness to accountability for reasonableness over the last decades  rationing of medical treatment in the national health service  nhs  has moved from implicit to being increasingly explicit about what is being denied and about the procedures and reasons for such decisions  this article argues that the courts have had an important role in this process  by applying a heightened scrutiny of rationing decisions  courts have forced health authorities to make better informed decisions and to take procedural justice more seriously to comply with  respond to and avoid judicial review  the analysis in this article reveals that litigation has contributed to incremental  but significant and enduring  changes in a social policy  it also offers insights to the paradoxes of judicial accountability in health care policies  
 from worker to self entrepreneur  the transformation of homo economicus and the freedom of movement in the european union this paper seeks to make a contribution to the study of personhood in eu free movement law by linking a historical and doctrinal analysis with the internal transformation of the homo economicus in economic liberalism  it is argued that a shift can be observed in the government of mobility from freeing up the ability of the worker as a relatively passive subject tied to external economic mechanisms to the targeting of the individual him herself as a responsible  active bearer of economic capability or human capital  whereby past socio economic conduct and prospective economic activity serve as the thresholds for the entitlement to rights  the essence of the new homo economicus of eu free movement law is situated at the intersection of the social and economic  serving as a rational frame for the government of the european mover on the basis of a mutual responsibility between the union citizen and his her host member state towards social and economic activity  self sufficiency and integration  
 frozen charters in 2012  the new york stock exchange changed its policies to prevent brokers from voting shares on corporate governance proposals when they have not received instructions from beneficial owners  although the change was intended to protect investors and improve corporate governance  it has had the opposite effect  a significant number of u s  public companies are no longer able to amend important parts of their corporate charters  despite the support of their boards of directors and overwhelming majorities of shareholders  their charters are frozen  this article provides the first empirical and policy analysis of the broker voting change and its significant unintended consequences  i provide empirical evidence that the broker voting change has resulted in the failure of more than fifty charter amendments at u s  public companies  despite board approval and overwhelming shareholder support  and that hundreds more companies have frozen charters as a result of the change  the rule change has also made it more difficult to amend corporate bylaws and given some insiders a de facto veto in proxy voting contests  these costs substantially outweigh the negligible benefits of the broker voting change  i compare a number of solutions to address these problems and identify several that would be preferable to the current approach  
 gender dysphoria in children american college of pediatricians   june 2017 gender dysphoria  gd  of childhood describes a psychological condition in which children experience a marked incongruence between their experienced gender and the gender associated with their biological sex  when this occurs in the pre pubertal child  gd resolves in the vast majority of patients by late adolescence  currently there is a vigorous  albeit suppressed  debate among physicians  therapists  and academics regarding what is fast becoming the new treatment standard for gd in children  this new paradigm is rooted in the assumption that gd is innate  and involves pubertal suppression with gonadotropin releasing hormone  gnrh  agonists followed by the use of cross sex hormones a combination that results in the sterility of minors  a review of the current literature suggests that this protocol is founded upon an unscientific gender ideology  lacks an evidence base  and violates the long standing ethical principle of  first do no harm   
 gendering disability to enable disability rights law this essay enriches the social model of disability by analyzing the interaction between disability and gender  the modern disability rights movement is built upon the social model  which understands disability not as an inherent personal deficiency but as the result of the environment with which an impairment interacts  the social model is reflected in the accommodation mandate of the americans with disabilities act of 1990  ada   which holds employers responsible for the limiting aspects of their workplace designs  this essay shows that the environmental limitations imposed upon impairments result not only from the physical aspects of a workplace but also from identity based stereotypes  biases  and oppressions that affect how disability is experienced and perceived  specifically  this essay furthers the social model by challenging the existing gender neutral view of the causes and consequences of disability  the analysis reveals how ignoring gender has enabled masculine norms to become embedded in the ada s substantive and procedural approaches to defining and remedying disability discrimination in the workplace  as a result of this inattention to gender  women with disabilities have suffered serious social and economic consequences  this essay demonstrates  more generally  how ignoring other social identities renders nonprototypic members of the disabled community legally invisible  and it reveals how attending to other social identities may advance the social model of disability  deepen our understanding of disability discrimination  and empower disability rights law to serve a more diverse group of individuals

 getting schooled  legal mobilization as an educative process this article explores the role of formal education and specific legal knowledge in the process of legal mobilization  using survey data and in depth case narratives of workplace disputes in china  we highlight three major findings  first  and uncontroversially  higher levels of formal education are associated with greater propensity to use legal institutions and to find them more effective  second  informally acquired labor law knowledge can substitute for formal education in bringing people to the legal system and improving their legal experiences  the chinese state s propagation of legal knowledge has had positive effects on citizens  legal mobilization  finally  while education and legal knowledge are factors that push people toward the legal system  actual dispute experience leads people away from it  especially among disputants without effective legal representation  the article concludes that the chinese state s encouragement of individualized legal mobilization produces contradictory outcomesencouraging citizens to use formal legal institutions  imbuing them with new knowledge and rights awareness  but also breeding disdain for the law in practice  
 good tv makes bad justice  how the rules of professional conduct can protect fair trial rights when prosecutors share information related to a criminal investigation with media production companies  and the media companies broadcast that information in the form of true crime reality shows before the accused has been tried  fair trial rights that serve as a cornerstone to the american judicial system are jeopardized  the history of american jurisprudence regarding balancing the media s first amendment rights with criminal defendants  sixth amendment rights has been shaped in large part by cases concerning requests for restraints upon news agencies  courts typically view these restraints skeptically  which reflects the high value this nation places on the contributions a free press makes to democracy  the development of true crime reality shows necessitates a different approach because of risks of hindering fair trial rights  interfering with the administration of justice  and potentially subjecting police and local governments to civil liability  arguably  the model rules of professional conduct and their various state counterparts already prohibit attorneys and prosecutors from providing information to these true crime television companies  but shows that clearly rely on inappropriate disclosures continue to pervade the airwaves  this note proposes that comments should be added to the model rules to make clear that sharing sensitive information that will be broadcast in true crime reality shows prior to trial will not be tolerated and will lead to attorney sanctions  
 governing by expertise  the contested politics of  accounting for  land based mitigation in a new climate agreement this article analyzes the contested politics of including  and accounting for  land based mitigation in a post 2020 climate agreement  emissions from land have been only partially included to date within the united nations framework convention on climate change and its kyoto protocol  the paris agreement  adopted in december 2015 and  applicable to all  for the post 2020 period  raises the possibility of unprecedented reliance on land based mitigation  this has significant consequences for furthering both ambition and equity in global climate mitigation efforts  yet  what are these consequences  and how have they manifested themselves in the existing  pre 2020  multilateral climate regime  what role do accounting rules for land based mitigation play herein  in addressing these questions  we identify key dimensions of what we term the  governance by expertise  approach taken to land based mitigation to date  which has served to reduce the environmental integrity of existing  developed country  mitigation efforts  specifically  we analyze land use accounting rules as a site of politics and highlight the  technicalization of politics  underway in this realm  which obscures the political implications of how land has been included to date  we conclude by considering whether the paris agreement institutionalizes similar dynamics  and the environmental integrity and equity implications of doing so  
 governing by targets  reductio ad unum and evolution of the two degree climate target targets are widely employed in environmental governance  in this paper  we investigate the construction of the 2 a degrees c climate target  one of the best known targets in global environmental governance  our paper examines this target through a historical reconstruction that identifies four different phases  framing  consolidation and diffusion  adoption  and disembeddedness  our analysis shows that  initially  the target was science driven and predominantly eu based  it then became progressively accepted at the international level  despite a lack of broader debate among governments on the policy implications and required measures for implementation  once the 2 a degrees c target was endorsed at the level of the united nations  the nature of the target changed from being policy prescriptive to being largely symbolic  in this phase  the target became a disembedded object in global governance not linked to a shared agenda nor to coordinated and mutually binding mitigation efforts  the 2015 paris agreement marks the last stage in this development and may have further solidified the target as a disembedded object  in the final part of the paper  we suggest ways to overcome the current situation and to develop the 2 a degrees c target into a fully fledged global environmental governance target  
 grave crimes and weak evidence  a fact finding evolution in international criminal law international criminal courts carry out some of the most important work that a legal system can conduct  prosecuting those who have visited death and destruction on millions  despite the significance of their work or perhaps because of it international courts face tremendous challenges  chief among them is accurate fact finding  with alarming regularity  international criminal trials feature inconsistent  vague  and sometimes false testimony that renders judges unable to assess with any measure of certainty who did what to whom in the context of a mass atrocity  this article provides the first ever empirical study quantifying fact finding in an international criminal court  the study shines a spotlight both on the testimonial deficiencies that impede accurate fact finding and on the judges  assessments of deficient witness testimony  although my previous work on fact finding has been generally critical of international criminal courts  this large scale empirical study provides far more reason for optimism  this study reveals a host of interesting and sometimes unexpected findings  taken as a whole  however  it depicts a criminal justice system that labors in the face of severe fact finding challenges but that has  over the years  appropriately altered its fact finding practices to respond to those challenges  
 greek debt relief politicians  journalists and economists from around the world are calling for a debt restructuring or even large scale debt relief to resolve the greek sovereign debt crisis  these voices are thus treating the issue as a matter of political will  this article argues that it is not  greek debt is predominantly owned by other eurozone member states and eurosystem central banks  as such  these creditors are not free to decide as they or their voters wish  eu rules set strict limits on political and economic discretion with regard to financial assistance among eu member states and vis a vis eu institutions  this article argues that these restrictive rules delineate clear boundaries for restructuring greece s debt  whether this debt is held by eu member states  eurozone financial facilities or the eurosystem  these rules even affect restructuring that is supported by a majority vote of creditors under collective action clauses in contracts associated with sovereign bond issuances  these conclusions are based on the recent ruling of the court of justice of the european union in gauweiler  although the court has clarified that the eurosystem is empowered to use a wide range of monetary policy tools in pursuit of the objectives in which it is mandated to engage  this article argues that the ruling also indicates that haircuts cannot be applied to debt instruments issued by eu member states by the same logic that prohibits monetary state financing  
 grounds for refusal of recognition of  quasi   annex judgements in the recast european insolvency regulation insolvency related  annex  actions and judgements fall within the scope of the recast european insolvency regulation   recast eir    that instrument both determines international jurisdiction regarding annex actions and sets up a simplified recognition system for annex judgements  however  tension between the recast eir s provisions on jurisdiction and recognition arises when a court of a state different from the state of insolvency erroneously assumes jurisdiction for annex actions  such   quasi annex  judgements rendered by foreign courts erroneously assuming jurisdiction threaten the integrity of the insolvency proceedings  besides  the quasi annex judgements may violate the effectiveness and efficiency of the insolvency proceedings as well as the principle of legal certainty  in this article  it is argued that even the current legal framework may offer some ways to avoid the recognition of such quasi annex judgements  first  the scope of the public policy exception may be extended in order to protect the integrity of the insolvency proceedings from the quasi annex judgements rendered by foreign courts erroneously assuming jurisdiction  second  it may be argued that quasi annex judgements do not equal real annex judgements and therefore do not enjoy the automatic recognition system provided by the recast eir  at the same time  their close connection to the insolvency proceedings   disregarded by the forum erroneously assuming jurisdiction   may exclude quasi annex judgements from the scope of the brussels ibis regulation  as well  as a consequence  those quasi annex judgements may fall within the gap between the two regulations  meaning that no european instrument instructs the courts of the member state addressed to recognise quasi annex judgements  copyright  c  2017 insol international and john wiley   sons  ltd

 herbie fully downloaded  data driven vehicles and the automobile exception the fourth amendment s automobile exception generally allows vehicles to be searched without a warrant  this lessened degree of protection is based partially on the need to afford law enforcement officials discretion when a suspect  evidence  or contraband is found in an automobile  it is also based on the diminished expectation of privacy in vehicles  due to their pervasive regulation and use of the public roadways  although an autonomous vehicle would seem to undermine the mobility rationale for the automobile exception  it is the information such vehicles collect about their drivers that merits a departure from established fourth amendment doctrine to ensure that basic privacy protections remain in full force  this note argues that although the mobility analysis of the automobile exception does not compel a new approach to fourth amendment analysis for autonomous vehicles  the information these vehicles collect represents such a significant privacy interest that law enforcement officials should be required to obtain a warrant before accessing vehicle data  this result is supported by the supreme court s analysis in riley v  california and united states v  jones

 how effective are employer return to work programs  reducing the recovery time for workers who are injured or disabled by a workplace accident is a key policy goal  this has motivated the promotion of employer based return to work programs  despite a lack of systematic evidence on the effectiveness of such programs  we combine data on duration of time out of work for workers  compensation claimants with information on employer return to work programs to estimate the impact of the programs on time out of work  discrete time hazard estimates suggest that the workers in a program return approximately 1 4 times sooner compared to workers injured at a firm without a program  the biggest reductions in work injury absence are experienced by men  likely due to occupational differences  and by workers with a permanent disability  modifying work equipment is associated with the greatest reductions in injury durations relative to other program components  back of the envelope calculations indicate that these programs are cost effective for large  self insured employers  more work is needed to determine whether these programs could be adopted successfully by smaller firms   c  2017 published by elsevier inc

 how important is the name in predicting false recognition for lookalike brands  an underexploited role for psychology in trademark law is the testing of explicit or implicit judicial assumptions about consumer behavior  in this article we examine an assumption that is common across commonwealth countries  namely  that similar packaging is unlikely to cause consumer confusion provided the brand names are dissimilar  we began by selecting branded products commonly found in supermarkets  for each existing brand we created 2 novel  fictitious  brands with highly similar packaging to the existing brand  one of these  lookalike  products had a similar name  the other a dissimilar name  across 2 yes no and 1 forced choice experiments using photographs of the real and fictitious products we looked at false recognition rates  contrary to the judicial assumption participants largely ignored the brand names when making their decisions based on memory  it was only when the pictures of the products were placed side by side  in the forced choice task  that they paid the brand name any significant attention  
 how often must we re invent the wheel  reflections on the most efficient structure of prosecution offices in international courts and why it is not generally used are historians or other country specialists needed in the investigation and prosecution of crimes under international law  experiences at international tribunals  from the nuremberg trials to the present  offer different answers to this question  this article argues that country specialists are indispensable and demonstrates how  time and again  in international or national settings  practical necessities have led to structural models in which lawyers  investigators and country specialists work together  a best practices  model for interdisciplinary investigations adopted by a group of national and international prosecution units is presented in detail  when creating new international tribunals  the un did not incorporate this model  what is needed for future tribunals is a structural framework of the office of the prosecutor  which includes country specialists  
 how qualified immunity fails this article reports the findings of the largest and most comprehensive study to date of the role qualified immunity plays in constitutional litigation  qualified immunity shields government officials from constitutional claims for money damages so long as the officials did not violate clearly established law  the supreme court has described the doctrine as incredibly strong protecting  all but the plainly incompetent or those who knowingly violate the law   legal scholars and commentators describe qualified immunity in equally stark terms  often criticizing the doctrine for closing the courthouse doors to plaintiffs whose rights have been violated  the court has repeatedly explained that qualified immunity must be as powerful as it is to protect government officials from burdens associated with participating in discovery and trial  yet the supreme court has relied on no empirical evidence to support its assertion that qualified immunity doctrine shields government officials from these assumed burdens  this article is the first to test this foundational assumption underlying the supreme court s qualified immunity decisions  i reviewed the dockets of 1 183 section 1983 cases filed against state and local law enforcement defendants in five federal court districts over a two year period and measured the frequency with which qualified immunity motions were brought by defendants  granted by courts  and dispositive before discovery and trial  i found that qualified immunity rarely served its intended role as a shield from discovery and trial in these cases  across the five districts in my study  just thirty eight  3 9   of the 979 cases in which qualified immunity could be raised were dismissed on qualified immunity grounds  and when one considers all the section 1983 cases brought against law enforcement defendants each of which could expose law enforcement officials to burdens associated with discovery and trial just seven  0 6   were dismissed at the motion to dismiss stage and thirty one  2 6   were dismissed at summary judgment on qualified immunity grounds  my findings enrich our understanding of qualified immunity s role in constitutional litigation  belie expectations about the policy interests served by qualified immunity  and show that qualified immunity doctrine should be modified to reflect its actual role in constitutional litigation  
 how rape myths are used and challenged in rape and sexual assault trials court responses to rape and sexual assault have been repeatedly criticized in england and wales  brown et al   2010   in particular  research has identified prevalent stereotypes about rape in both the criminal justice system and wider society  with these rape myths often being used as the predominant explanation for inadequate victim survivor treatment  see temkin and krahe  2008   the existing literature  though  tends to rely on interviews or is outdated by policy  so the present research uses court observations to explore what is actually happening in adult rape and sexual assault trials  the findings show that rape myths are still routinely used at trial  but that they are sometimes resisted using judicial directions or prosecution comments  in addition  the research highlights how rape myths are kept relevant  to trial through a focus on inconsistencies  a dichotomy of wholly truthful untruthful witnesses  and conceptualisations of rational  behaviour as being the normal  way to act  these findings provide a new understanding of rape myths and have implications for policy  in particular  that while training legal professionals is helpful  it cannot be expected to fully address the use of rape myths  
 how states can take a stand against prison banking profiteers in recent years  state corrections departments have faced pressure to provide better prison conditions while simultaneously cutting costs  many critics have touted the emergence of privatized prison services as a cost effective resolution  however  those services shift the costs on to some of the poorest and most vulnerable consumers prisoners and their families  this note explores how private companies providing prison banking services to state correctional facilities use unfair practices to increase profits  the umbrella of prison banking services includes deposits into inmate trust accounts  which allow prisoners to purchase necessities  and prepaid debit release cards  which are used to return money to prisoners upon release  this note describes how certain private companies retain a monopoly on these services  and are awarded contracts based on the amount of commission paid to state correctional facilities  as a result of paying those commissions and having no incentive to cut costs  private companies drive up their prices and charge consumers exorbitant rates to make deposits or to utilize prepaid cards  these practices disproportionately affect prisoners  families who provide their incarcerated loved ones with monetary support  and released inmates struggling to get back on their feet post incarceration  statistically  both of these groups are more likely to be low income and least able to manage additional financial strain  this note proposes state level legislation to better protect consumers from these abuses and outlines five key provisions that  if adopted  will serve to prevent private companies from unreasonably increasing their profit margins at the expense of vulnerable consumers  
 how to enforce european law  a new history of the battle over the direct effect of directives  1958 1987 this article explores the well known saga of the european court of justice s introduction of direct effect of council directives on the basis of new comprehensive archival research  the expansion of the doctrine of direct effect to include directives was part of a drive of the legal service of the european commission and the ecj to strengthen the enforcement of european law  this threatened the deeper balance of competences between the european community and its member states and consequently led to a sharp response from the national parliaments and courts  the force of these responses and the deep crisis that had evolved in the late 1970s between france and the ecj  led to a change in the ec s case law that limited the direct effect of directives to the vertical relation between citizens and the respective member state and excluded any horizontal effect  the story is an example of how the activist ecj of the 1970s ran into resistance from the member states and had to modify its doctrinal advances  it also suggests that the successful acceptance of the constitutionalisation of the treaties of rome pursued by the ecj was by no means secure by the late 1970s  
 humanizing the corporation while dehumanizing the individual  the misuse of deferred prosecution agreements in the united states american prosecutors routinely offer deferred prosecution and nonprosecution agreements to corporate defendants  but not to noncorporate defendants  the drafters of the speedy trial act expressly contemplated such agreements  as originally developed for use in cases involving low level  nonviolent  noncorporate defendants  this note posits that the almost exclusive use of deferrals in corporate cases is inconsistent with the goal that these agreements initially sought to serve  the note further argues that this exclusivity can be attributed to prosecutors  tendency to only consider collateral consequences in corporate cases and not in noncorporate cases  ultimately  this note recommends that prosecutors evaluate collateral fallout when deciding whether to prosecute noncorporate  as well as corporate  defendants and that the department of justice adopt departmental guidelines to ensure compliance with this goal  
 humility when responding to the abuse of adults with mental disabilities legal theorists often reduce the ethics of responding to the abuse of another person to a clash between the principles of autonomy and protection  this reduction is a problem  responding  to suspected abuse requires humility   the potential responder must be aware of and respect their own limits   but humility cannot be usefully reduced to protection and autonomy  using examples from the court of protection of england and wales  this article examines the different ways that someone responding to abuse should respect their own limits  and suggests that a failure to do so will disproportionately affect people with mental disabilities  it is therefore necessary to attend to whether the law fosters humility among those who respond to abuse  although this must be tempered by huniility about legal reform itself  finally  the article shows how attention to humility can assist the interpretation of article 16 of the un convention on the rights of persons with disabilities  and suggests that  so interpreted  the convention may help to promote humility when responding to abuse  crown copyright  c  2017 published by elsevier ltd  all rights reserved  
 hybrid jury strikes modern jury selection is pulled in two directions  equal protection prohibits racial discrimination  but the traditional peremptory strike permits exclusion of a juror without explanation  to reconcile this tension  the court developed the batson framework  requiring lawyers to articulate ex post race neutral justifications for suspicious strikes  but many doubt batson s efficacy at uncovering latent discrimination  during the 2015 16 term  while recognizing a batson violation in foster v  chatman  the supreme court counter intuitively reinforced this concern  foster is the rare case in which prosecutors documented in writing their reliance on race  a framework that depends on such transparency is weak and ineffective  and the systemic persistence of discrimination  three decades after batson was decided  has convinced many that the only solution is to eliminate peremptory strikes in their entirety  in this article  i offer an alternative strategy  i introduce a new mechanism to reform   but not entirely eliminate   the system of peremptory challenges  the  hybrid jury strike   hybrid strikes would fall in between traditional peremptory challenges  which may be exercised at the party s discretion  and challenges for cause  which may be granted only upon an adequate showing of juror bias or other basis for disqualification  hybrid strikes would require ex ante justification but not a conclusive showing of bias  they could be used to exclude a set number of jurors who survived non pretextual and meaningful cause challenges  hybrid strikes could replace traditional peremptories wholesale or could be leveraged asymmetrically   for example  by preserving traditional peremptories for the defense while permitting only hybrid strikes for the prosecution  hybrid strikes offer an intermediate approach between the status quo and complete abolition of peremptory challenges  they would meaningfully curtail discrimination while preserving the most legitimate function of peremptory challenges  to foster jury impartiality by providing a buffer zone for cause challenges when evidence of bias is credible but insufficient or when judges erroneously reject them  
 hydropower development in india  the legal economic design to fuel growth  economic liberalization beginning in the early 1990s has represented a paradigm shift in policy discourse in india  from social welfare to economic growth  with its potential benefits of generating power for the growing economy and significant revenue through electricity sales and royalty payments  hydropower development has received center stage in the hydro rich but economically weaker himalayan states of india  using an institutional approach to examine the evolution of laws and policies on electricity  land  environment  and water  this article seeks to uncover how prevailing legal and economic systems prioritize hydropower generation over other water uses  it argues that federal and state governments have brought about regulatory changes that tip the allocation and distribution of resources and wealth in the favor of increasingly private sector dominated hydropower development  this resource colonization favors maximizing returns on investment at the expense of minimizing environmental and social costs  the case of the indian state of uttarakhand illustrates the structural power of the state government to frame and enforce laws to protect hydropower development while forgoing considerations of environmental flows and the de facto water rights of communities  changing this status quo will require fundamental alterations to the current institutional structures to ensure a more just and equitable hydropower development regime  these changes which give greater consideration to socio environmental sustainability and promote integrated water resources management should comprise  acknowledging ecosystem and water rights  creating mechanisms where local communities can contest unfair resource allocation  delineating guidelines for states  role as public trustees of water  promoting local participation in monitoring related to hydropower projects  and balancing economic goals with alternative water uses  
 iatrogenic tracheoarterial fistula  case report and literature review tracheo innominate fistula is a rare but recognised life threatening complication most commonly associated with prolonged endotracheal intubation  we report the case of a 16 year old boy who developed a tracheo innominate fistula secondary to the prolonged intubation after a pool accident  after 16 days of hospitalisation  the patient died as a consequence of a massive haemorrhage into the tracheobronchial tree and asphyxia  this is a rare complication  and to our knowledge  no case of tracheo innominate fistula or any other case series concerning this rare complication has been reported in serbia recently  this case report addresses the epidemiology of a trachea innominate fistulisation as a complication of prolonged tracheal intubation  with a special overview of its forensic importance as an iatrogenic injury  
 image based sexual abuse advances in technology have transformed and expanded the ways in which sexual violence can be perpetrated  one new manifestation of such violence is the non consensual creation and or distribution of private sexual images  what we conceptualise as  image based sexual abuse   this article delineates the scope of this new concept and identifies the individual and collective harms it engenders  we argue that the individual harms of physical and mental illness  together with the loss of dignity  privacy and sexual autonomy  combine to constitute a form of cultural harm that impacts directly on individuals  as well as on society as a whole  while recognising the limits of law  we conclude by considering the options for redress and the role of law  seeking to justify the deployment of the expressive and coercive powers of criminal and civil law as a means of encouraging cultural change  
 imaging victims  offenders and communities  an investigation into the representations of the crime stakeholders within restorative justice and their cultural context this work is a critical analysis of how the main crime stakeholders  victim  offender and community  are represented within policy and legal statutes on restorative justice  the paper starts by sketching out the legal and policy archive of restorative justice  focussing on the most recurrent normative representations of the victim  offender and community  and unearthihg their theoretical underpinnings  the goal is to identify a range of typified features and to assemble them together by profiling the  ideal stakeholders  of restorative justice  the research includes a comparison between the  ideal  victim  offender and community  pinpointing any overlaps and differences  finally  it interrogates the cultural context within which these representations have emerged historically  influencing policy and laws  by way of reconstructing and discussing what is taken for granted in restorative justice and its background  the aim of the work is to foster critical reflection on the normative dimension of a popular development of western penal policies   c  2017 elsevier ltd  all rights reserved  
 impact of innovation on competition law  from the perspective of ad blocking applications innovation was traditionally protected for its outcome in particular under intellectual property laws  however  this approach has gradually reached its limit when more innovation needs to be stimulated  antitrust law has thus developed a  process oriented  protection  despite the fact that such a new approach slightly intrudes on the exclusivity of property rights  however  less has been discussed so far on how anti unfair competition law has been affected by innovation  anti unfair competition law targets conduct that dishonestly takes advantage of other competitors  thus traditionally having its core analytical framework built upon tort law  while the  outcome oriented  approach is still satisfactory from many perspectives  its drawbacks have been extensively revealed with the recent challenge of ad blocking applications  at first sight  the traditional approach may be justified  however  closer examination unfolds the risk of stifling innovation  therefore  this article advances a new economic interpretation on the business model of online media operation  the target of ad blocking applications  namely the  combined sale  model vis vis the traditional  single product  model  it is finally concluded that the process oriented approach should prevail over the traditional outcome oriented approach where the combined sale model is involved   c  2017 liyang hou  published by elsevier ltd  all rights reserved  
 impact of patent litigation on the subsequent patenting behavior of the plaintiff small and medium enterprises in japan this paper examines the impact of patent litigation on the subsequent patenting behavior of the plaintiff small and medium enterprises  smes  in japan  the results show that plaintiff smes tend to reduce patent applications after patent litigation  although there are several possible interpretations for this finding  we argue that it is most likely due to the negative effects of the high cost of patent litigation on the r d activities of the plaintiff smes during the period of patent litigation  moreover  we also find that the strength of patent rights applied for by the plaintiff smes after patent litigation increases  we argue that this is because the plaintiff smes realize the importance of the quality of patent rights and learn how to apply for stronger patent rights after experiencing patent litigation as plaintiffs  however  this learning effect only lasts until the fourth year after litigation and then disappears or starts to reverse beginning with the fifth year after litigation   c  2017 elsevier inc  all rights reserved

 independent directors in singapore  puzzling compliance requiring explanation at first blush  the rise of independent directors in singapore provides a straightforward example of a successful legal transplant from the west to asia  in 2001  singapore implemented a u k  inspired code of corporate governance  which required the adoption of american style independent directors on a  comply or explain  basis  shortly thereafter  an overwhelming 98  of singapore listed companies reported full compliance  this  combined with singapore s world leading economic success  ostensibly confirmed the anglo american cum  global conventional wisdom that american style independent directors are required for good corporate governance  using hand collected data from 245 codes of corporate governance from eighty seven jurisdictions  this article reveals  however  that singapore s supposedly conventional legal transplant of american style independent directors was  in fact  highly unconventional  we empirically demonstrate that the widely held belief that the american concept of the independent director has been transplanted around the world is a myth  we argue  however  that singapore s highly unconventional and seemingly illogical decision to transplant american style independent directors into its concentrated controlling block shareholder environment was the product of strategic regulatory design  not ignorance  and was surprisingly effective  it all but guaranteed exceptionally high compliance rates  which sent a critical signal of  good  corporate governance to international markets in the wake of the asian financial crisis and simultaneously allowed singapore to functionally maintain its efficient state owned and family owned controlling shareholder environment  we confirm our findings using quantitative  qualitative  and hand collected data which provide fresh insights into singapore s intriguing institutional architecture and the unique role played by independent directors in singapore s successful state owned enterprises and family controlled corporations  in addition  we suggest that singapore s successful  but highly unconventional  use of american style independent directors provides a number of important insights into some critical areas of comparative corporate law theory  as many countries  including china  have suggested that they intend to adopt the singapore model of corporate governance  this article also provides practical insights into how the independent director may evolve as a corporate governance mechanism in other critically important economies in asia and around the world  
 indigenous african jurisprudential thoughts on the concept of justice  a reconstruction through yoruba proverbs the absence of writing in pre colonial africa has often befuddled indigenous african jurisprudential thoughts about law and related concepts  this article attempts a reconstruction of indigenous african jurisprudential thoughts on the concept of justice through a prescriptive exploration of yoruba proverbs  this attempt reveals inter alia the reconciliatory and metaphysical nature and character of justice  as well as the goals of punishment and the character and nature of a desirable judicial system in african thoughts  while noting the artificiality of the categorizations adopted for the reconstruction  the author cautions that  although it may be necessary to compare the indigenous african conceptions of justice with similar postulations in western jurisprudence  the true value of the former lies in their proper understanding and appreciation within the indigenous african setting  as doing otherwise might lead to contradictions and absurdities  
 indigenous land rights and caribbean reparations discourse in march 2014  a meeting of caricom states approved a ten point plan of the caribbean reparations commission to achieve reparatory justice for the victims of slavery  genocide and racial apartheid in the caribbean  with assistance from the london based law firm leigh day  the aim is to reach a negotiated settlement with the governments of britain  france and the netherlands  what makes this case different from previous discussions on caribbean reparations is that the claim includes an indigenous component  with  native genocide  included in the title and an  indigenous peoples  development program  included within the ten point plan for reparations  yet reparations are problematic in the caribbean context due to the ongoing violation of indigenous rights internally  this article analyzes the various dimensions of the caribbean reparations discourse with regard to contemporary indigenous communities in the region  it highlights the problems at regional level with regard to state responsibility and indigenous rights  particularly in relation to land  and argues that this presents a problematic element in the claim due to the fact that violations are being perpetrated against indigenous peoples by the same states who are representing them in the caribbean reparations commission  finally  it discusses the onus on european governments to acknowledge past wrongs and the potential of  cultural reparations  to contribute to the caribbean reparatory justice programme more generally  
 information and settlement  empirical evidence on daubert rulings and settlement rates in 1993  the supreme court established a new standard for the admissibility of expert evidence with its decision in daubert v  merrell dow pharmaceuticals  although whether daubert actually has increased the reliability of expert evidence remains an open question  empirical research generally suggests that daubert has increased the judicial role in expert testimony as the number of challenges has increased  an unexplored topic to date is how daubert outcomes impact litigation outcomes  this paper aims to fill that gap by examining how daubert outcomes in federal district court affect the likelihood and timing of settlement  this paper also fits into the larger empirical literature that explores how information flows impact settlement  the sample of 2127 daubert motions made in 1017 private cases from 91 federal district courts  spanning from 2003 2014  and involving 57 different causes of action provides the most comprehensive overview of daubert practice in federal courts to date  the main empirical results suggest that defendant daubert wins  plaintiff wins  are associated with a reduction  increase  in the likelihood of settlement  results from duration analysis suggest that longer pendency time for daubert motions are associated with lower settlement rates  a 4 7  reduction in the rate of settlement for every month that a daubert motion goes undecided   decomposition finds that the indirect effect of daubert pendency  delay due to the reduction in communication between parties while daubert motions pend before the court  accounts for the majority  70   of the measured reduction in the settlement rate  one way that courts might reduce the cost of litigation if they were to adopt  lone pine  type procedures that structure expert discovery and concomitant daubert motions early  especially when expert testimony is required to prove certain elements of a claim   c  2017 elsevier inc  all rights reserved

 inherent imperialism since 2008  the international criminal court has been subject to criticism for being somehow imperialist  and some criticism of the court has pursued a distinctly anti imperialist narrative  whilst such criticism is often motivated by political considerations  this article examines whether the narrative can be to a certain extent due to provisions of the rome statute itself  rather than contingent choices made by court organs  this involves analysing the law for traces of what this article terms   inherent imperialism   this is where the text of an instrument implicitly envisages an unequal or hierarchical legal structure  if some of the rome statute s features can be considered inherently imperialist  this could provide a partial justification for some of the political attacks on the court s choices  this article  by providing a theoretical framework  which interprets claims that the law is imperialist  aims to put the anti imperialist attacks on the court in perspective

 injecting compassion into international wildlife law  from conservation to protection  international wildlife law is concerned with the conservation of sentient species  but generally ignores the welfare of individual animals  it therefore does not reflect a recognition of the moral worth of animals and perpetuates the dichotomy between conservation and welfare  it is the primary goal of this article to ascertain how welfare concerns may be incorporated into international wildlife law in order to ensure that it takes cognizance of the moral worth of animals  the article advocates an injection of ethics  via a welfare centric approach  into wildlife law in order to escape the dichotomy between conservation and welfare in relation to wild animals  and so to advance the progressive development of law that is conducive to wildlife protection rather than merely to its conservation  
 injustice through transitional justice  subversion strategies in burundi s peace process and postconflict developments embedded in burundi s peace process  the creation of judicial and nonjudicial transitional justice  tj  mechanisms promised truth  reconciliation and justice to the victims of crimes committed during conflict  yet  an analysis of the dynamics of the localization of tj reveals multiple subversion techniques mobilized by national and international actors  leading to counterproductive outcomes  this article explores these dynamics and formulates two arguments  first  these subversion techniques are the consequence of a double phenomenon  on the one hand  the conjunction of the normalization of tj in the postconflict toolbox and the nature of the internationalization of burundi s peace process has made the pursuit of tj inevitable  on the other  the incompatibilities between tj and divergent priorities  interests and agendas have made its realization equally impossible  secondly  this subversion has led to a triple form of  transitional  injustice  a denial of justice through  temporary immunities   an absence of justice through a negotiation process more oriented towards noninception than the creation of tj mechanisms  and a risk of biased justice through the modalities and timing of the national truth and reconciliation commission  conclusions of this article call for a greater questioning of the tj model promoted and deeper research into the localization dynamics  especially in post peace settlement contexts  
 inside perspective  the acpr s view on the operational functioning of the banking union the establishment of the european banking union  as well as the harmonization of legal frameworks  has significantly changed the exercise of both supervision and resolution in the euro area  as regards to banking supervision  the single supervisory mechanism endows the european central bank with unprecedented supervisory functions  more recently  the single resolution board  as the commission s agency  has been set up as a central pillar of the single resolution mechanism  yet  national authorities remain key actors in the smooth functioning of banking supervision and resolution  the institutional mechanisms put in place foresee a deep coordination between european and national authorities for the day to day work as well as for the preparation of decisions  as members of the decision making bodies  and bringing the expertise of their national competences to the table  national authorities have the opportunity to enrich the decision making process at european level and to contribute to an adequate supervision and resolution framework for the banking industry of 19 countries  the banking union has led to a very unique collegial approach proving the strong complementarity of central and national authorities  thus  both the contribution of european and national levels must be regarded as essential to the operational functioning of the supervision of european banking groups  
 insuring your donation  an experiment an increasing fraction of donations is channeled through donation intermediaries  these entities serve multiple purposes  one of which seems to be providing donors with greater certainty  that the donation reaches its intended goal  and that the donor may be sure to receive a tax benefit  we interpret this function as insurance and test the option to insure donations in the lab  our participants indeed have a positive willingness to pay for insurance against either contingency  yet the insurance option is only critical for their willingness to donate to a charity if the risk affects the proper use of their donation  participants have a higher willingness to pay for insurance if  in case the risk materializes  they receive their money back  with this design of the insurance  almost no participant wants to donate if she is not insured

 inter american case law on femicide  obscuring intersections  the inter american human rights system has broken new ground in the field of violence against women  vaw  by delineating the concept of femicide  the principle of due diligence  clarifying the obligations of the states regarding violence and a adopting a gender perspective on reparations  in recent years   intersectionality   the study of the interconnections of race  ethnicity  religion  age  class  sexual orientation and other categories of difference in relation to inequality  has been promoted in human rights law for tackling vaw  this approach poses new challenges for the interpretation of cases  this article examines to what extent the inter american court of human rights and the inter american commission have incorporated an intersectional view of violence against women into cases of femicide and discusses the potential of doing so in the future  
 interagency transfers of adjudication authority agencies sometimes give away their legislatively delegated decision making power of their own accord  more specifically  agencies make agreements in order to transfer their entire jurisdiction to adjudicate administrative decisions to other agencies  this article is the first to explore these mostly informal  endogenous interagency arrangements  one example of this dynamic involves the authority to adjudicate the legality of pharmaceutical imports and exports  initially delegated by congress to the department of treasury  treasury has since transferred this authority to the u s  customs and border patrol via interagency agreement  which then retransferred this authority to the food and drug administration  fda  by means of another interagency agreement  the fda does not have clear statutory authority to make these decisions  however  transferring this set of adjudications to the fda allows it to bring its superior technocratic expertise to bear  which may lead to higher quality decision making  on the one hand  these arrangements could be harbingers of a future in which agencies take advantage of opportunities to shirk  deteriorate rule of law values  and usurp the legislative branch s power to define agency jurisdiction and make the law  on the other hand  interagency transfers of adjudication authority represent agencies  potential to improve administrative decision making by sharing or even transferring power based on their on the ground knowledge of their own varying capacity to implement an efficient and effective regime of administrative adjudication  this article argues that that there is a way to ensure these interagency transfers of power and responsibilities are both beneficial to the quality of administrative decision making and also constitutional in particular  by allowing those agreements that benefit the quality of administrative decision making to be deemed legitimate if grounded in statutory language authorizing interagency coordination  finally  it proposes that courts play a primary role in shaping the development of high quality interagency transfers of adjudication authority and ensuring that they remain within permissible constitutional bounds  
 interests  powers and mere equities in modern land law english land registration law is a work in progress  there remain important unresolved issues concerning the conceptual building blocks used in the land registration act 2002  this article focuses on rights to correct the land register  it considers the place of such rights in the ordering of estates  interests  rights and equities  and makes proposals about the characteristics of these rights so as to produce an integrated  coherent regime which combines the blunt rule for the passing of property with a sophisticated remedial regime for its recovery  having analysed the right to rectify  it concludes that the right to rectify shares such similarities with the  mere equity  that classification as a right to rectify makes sense in explaining the current law  in terms of policy  however  this classification is inappropriate and reform is required  potential options for such reform are considered  
 international conceptions of the family this article examines the evolving way the  family  and  family life  have been understood in international and regional human rights instruments  and in the case law of the relevant institutions  it shows how the various structural components which are considered to constitute those concepts operate both between relevant adults and between adults and children  but it also shows that important normative elements  in particular  anti discrimination norms  operate both to undermine the perception of some structures as constituting  family   and to modify those structures themselves  this raises the question how far human rights norms should be seen as protecting family units in themselves or the individual members that constitute them  
 international cooperation and responsibility sharing to protect refugees  what  why and how  while countries that receive refugees have certain legal obligations to assist and protect them  the legal duties of other states to step in and help relieve this burden is less clear  despite multiple proposals  a mechanism to systematically  equitably and predictably allocate responsibilities between states at a global level has still not been agreed  the un s high level summit on addressing large movements of refugees on 19 september 2016 held some promise in this regard  but the resulting new york declaration was more muted than earlier drafts  this article seeks to provide a unique insight into the meaning of responsibility sharing and international cooperation from the perspective of individual states  it does so by examining statements they have made at various un fora over the past decade  it focuses on the two main methods of sharing responsibilities  namely the provision of financial and other assistance to host countries  and the admission of refugees  it then considers the extent to which states perceive responsibility sharing to be a legal obligation  as opposed to a voluntary undertaking  and analyses this in light of expert opinion  finally  it discusses the principle of common but differentiated responsibilities  a concept drawn from international environmental law  and considers whether and how it might apply in the international refugee law context  
 international data transfers  the effect of divergent cultural views in privacy causes deja vu whether operating globally or simply integrating services on the internet  many business functions inevitably subject companies to a web of complicated international regulatory and legal requirements  for example  collecting customer information worldwide  working with suppliers abroad  or operating a foreign subsidiary each trigger an obligation to protect the personal data of the individuals involved with those transactions adequately  and in accordance with various jurisdictional specific  because thousands of american companies are affected by europe s strict requirements  the department of commerce  along with the european commission  implemented the international safe harbor agreement   safe harbor   to assist companies in complying with european data protection laws  an interesting turn of events ignited significant discourse about whether the safe harbor provided satisfactory protection for european data transferred to the united states  one european national s challenge of the safe harbor provision led the european court of justice to review its adequacy  ultimately leading to the data transfer mechanism s invalidation  soon thereafter  a new framework  the u s  e u  privacy shield   privacy shield   replaced the safe harbor  however  this new replacement mechanism has drawn equally harsh criticism  this note seeks to understand the disapproval of the two regulatory frameworks governing overseas data transfers  and begins by undertaking a brief analysis of the social forces shaping the vastly different regulatory approaches to privacy protection that exist in the united states and the european union  the author suggest that such disapproval stems from different cultural notions in the united states and europe about privacy that are deeply rooted in those nations  respective histories  the result  deja vu for the european court of justice as they prepare for another challenge to the validity of the existing international data transfer framework less than one year after its adoption and the date it took effect

 international environmental agreements for biodiversity conservation  a game theoretic analysis this paper contributes to the emerging literature on international environmental agreements with an analysis of key characteristics for biodiversity conservation  we study three features that are specific to an international conservation agreement  the existence of a natural upper bound of conservation in each country  the importance of local benefits  and the subadditivity of the global conservation function  we consider asymmetries in benefits and costs of conservation and  separately  in the upper bound of conservation in each country  and we examine the impacts of these features on coalition stability and on the effectiveness of biodiversity agreements  results show that subadditivity of the global conservation function can lead to larger stable coalitions  the inclusion of a transfer scheme that might be implemented through  e g   international trade of biodiversity credits  can have an impact on coalition composition and can improve conservation outcomes and the size of stable coalitions in certain ranges of the parameter space  
 international law and the military use of unmanned maritime systems unmanned maritime systems  umss  comprise an important subcategory of unmanned military devices  while much of the normative debate concerning the use of unmanned aerial and land based devices applies equally to those employed on or under water  ums present unique challenges in understanding the application of existing law  this article summarizes the technological state of the art before considering  in turn  the legal status of umss  particularly under the un convention on the law of the sea  unclos   and the regulation of their use under the law of naval warfare  it is not yet clear if umss enjoy status as ships under unclos  even if they do  it is unlikely that they can be classified as warships  nevertheless  their lawful use is not necessarily precluded in either peacetime or armed conflict

 international legal theory symposium lawbetween global and colonial  techniques of empire introduction the deep relation between the colonial past and contemporary international law has been convincingly established  scholars from diverse backgrounds  employing a variety of approaches  have shown the multifaceted ways in which the colonial enterprise occasioned the birth of doctrines and practices that are still in common use  the conference that occasioned this symposium  the last of the project history of international law  between religion and empire  directed by martti koskenniemi  was held in helsinki in october 2016 and approached the issue of the colonial legacy of international law from the point of view of specific histories  the techniques of empire  raised at the conference encompassed colonial governance in the broadest sense  looking at practices  norms and normative systems  doctrines and concepts  and events  the case studies making up the articles featured in the symposium treat subjects as diverse as the experiences of colonialism have been  assuming an array of forms  even so  from the multiplicity of techniques certain patterns and themes emerge  
 internet cases in eu private international lawdeveloping a coherent approach internet communication has long been known to pose a challenge to private international law and its reliance on geographical connecting factors  this article looks at the problem from the perspective of eu private international law and argues that the way in which it has been accommodated by regulations brussels i  rome i  and ii conflicts with some of its central paradigms  it advances an alternative approach that would generally submit claims against information society service providers established in the eu to the jurisdiction and substantive laws of their country of origin  but make certain exceptions for private persons and consumers  the article argues that implementing such an approach would require little legislative change  be more faithful to the particularities of internet communication  and give greater effect to the central paradigms of eu private international law

 is it good law  network analysis and the cjeu s internal market jurisprudence an increasing number of legal scholars have been attracted to using network analysis  particularly by the possibility of conducting large scale studies of case law  in this article  we discuss how network analysis can provide new and important information about the law governing the european union s internal market by making possible the study of the entire jurisprudence of the court of justice of the european union  cjeu   including changes over time  we apply different network centrality measurements to key cjeu internal market decisions and compare how accurately they capture the precedential and persuasive power of case law  in so doing  we reach conclusions that can be used to better understand not only the law of the internal market  but also the law of any case law driven jurisdiction such as wto dispute settlement or investor state arbitration  
 is it possible to grant legal personality to artificial intelligence software systems  the purpose of this paper is to determine whether systems of artificial intelligence  sai  can be deemed subjects of law  this aim is formulated according to the technical capabilities integrated in sai and the sat s ability to interact independently with other legal subjects  sai features  such as direct connection with intellectual skills  the ability to understand  learn and make autonomous decisions may cause situations where autonomous systems based on al will make decisions which will be in the best interests of individuals  even though conflicting with the user s own will  to consider the possibility of sai being recognized as possessing legal personality  we analyse the concept and features of sai and define its operating principles  we give hypothetical examples to demonstrate the necessity of sals being recognized as such  the paper undertakes legal personality analysis of sai performed   i  using the philosophical and legal concepts of a subject  person    ii  discussing artificial  unnatural subjects of law  as an alternative to the recognition of legal personality of sai   iii  using elements of legal personality set for natural and legal persons  the analysis leads to the conclusion that the scope of sai rights and obligations will not necessarily be the same as the scope of rights and obligations of other subjects of law  thus  sai could only have rights and obligations that are strictly defined by legislators  this conclusion suggests that the result of this paper may be its use in further research defining the scope of sai rights and obligations   c  2017 paulius cerka  jurgita grigiene    gintare sirbikyte  published by elsevier ltd  all rights reserved  
 is it rational and consistent  the wto s surprising role in shaping domestic public policy what makes regulation rational  and why is rationality important to an international tribunal  in the world trade organization  wto  context  these questions have had significant implications for the public policy of its member countries  the wto appellate body s emerging emphasis on means ends rationality testing is based on the questionable premise that consistent regulation is non discriminatory  it has led regulators  such as the eu  to defend and probably even construct complex regulation in a way that emphasizes conformity to one overarching policy objective  more surprisingly  the appellate body has re cast itself as public policy watchdog  pointing out when governments do not appear to be committed to their cause  in response  governments have strengthened disputed regulation  rather than making it less trade restrictive  this retreat to rationality can be seen as a result of a difficult challenge facing the appellate body  how to review national regulation without passing judgment on it  more specifically  the rationality test pays the price of the appellate body s retreat from proportionality  
 is mazur the new langdell  the strange trajectory of interactive law teaching this paper examines the cross fertilisation of ideas about interactive teaching from law to physics and back again  in particular it considers the origin  legacy and merits of langdell s teaching model and the way it has been used by a physics professor  eric mazur  to support arguments for what is commonly known as the flipped classroom   it examines the similarities and differences between langdell s and mazur s approaches and the adoption by some law teachers of mazur s model  it also considers how this phenomenon bares out a thesis advanced by educationalist lee shulman that when it comes to teaching  both professional and liberal disciplines are pursuing many of the same ends  finally it considers the implications of adopting mazur s approach for the discipline of law and issues some words of caution  
 it s now or never  using deadlines as nudges incorporating behavioral insights into regulation is plausibly the most significant development in regulatory theory and practice in recent years  behaviorally informed regulation encourages self benefiting and socially desirable behaviors with little intrusion on autonomy  drawing on new empirical findings  this article puts forward the hitherto overlooked possibility of employing the deadline effect as a regulatory tool  deadlines serve as an antidote to procrastination and forgetfulness  many empirical and experimental studies have examined the use of deadlines in marketing  this study explores the possible use of deadlines by legal policy makers  it describes two survey experiments  a randomized field experiment and a natural experiment  which suggest that deadlines may encourage self benefiting and socially desirable behaviors  and that relaxing deadlines may discourage less desirable behavior  the article discusses the practical and normative aspects of using deadlines as a regulatory means  compared to alternative tools  such as default rules and required choices  
 jacobins at justice  the  failed  class action revolution of 1978 and the puzzle of american procedural political economy in 1978  top doj officials in the carter administration floated a revolutionary proposal that would have remade the consumer class action and  with it  the relationship of litigation and administration in the american regulatory state  at the proposal s core was a  public action  for widespread small damages claims that sought to replace rule 23 with a hybrid public private enforcement model  similar to the false claims act  this new mechanism would have granted private plaintiffs the power to bring lawsuits on behalf of the united states and recover a finder s fee if successful  but it also gave the doj substantial screening authority and control over such actions  including the ability to take over suits or dismiss them outright  despite months of shuttle diplomacy among interest groups  a pair of bills in congress  and full scale committee hearings  this creative blend of private initiative and public oversight soon fizzled  yet the story of the proposal s rise and fall nonetheless provides a venue for wider reflection about american civil procedure and the political economy that produces it  indeed  the failed revolution of 1978 reveals a contingent moment when the american litigation system was splintering into the pluralistic  chaotic one we now take for granted  including hard charging state attorneys general  a federal administrative state with litigation authority independent of the doj  and a sophisticated and politically potent plaintiffs  bar  in retrospect  the proposal may have been the last best chance to counter the centrifugal tendencies of an american state that was progressively empowering ever more institutional actors within the litigation system  just as important  lurking in the background of the story of 1978 is the bracing possibility that the rules enabling act  for all its virtues in revising technocratic procedural rules  has systematically enervated efforts to address larger procedural design questions in an increasingly dense and interconnected regulatory world  
 jameses at play  a tractation on the comparison of laws withstanding trendyism and its abrupt brevities  shunning the contemporary s brisk cadences  this article compares two salient comparativisms at law  while it argues that these models are epistemically irreconcilable in significant respects and that one approach is emphatically more interpretively empowering than the other it also claims that neither strategy is able to escape the play of the text  the inevitability of comparativism as play means that every enunciation of foreign law and every comparison at law must stand as the comparativist s invention  as an exercise in self portraiture also  as an egotrope  
 japanese approaches to extraterritoriality in competition law extraterritorial application of domestic competition law is an important feature of the current regulatory framework governing anticompetitive conduct  japan was initially hesitant to apply its antimonopoly act in such a manner  however  over the last two decades there has been a significant shift in its approach  japan has gradually embraced extraterritoriality and the japan fair trade commission has actively enforced competition law in a purely offshore context  this article investigates this evolution and considered the most recent and controversial cases in which japan has applied its laws in a distinctive fashion  
 judges  perceptions of screening  assessment  prevention  and treatment for substance use mental health  and hiv among juveniles on community supervision  results of a national survey juvenile justice translational research on interventions for adolescents in the legal system  jj trials  national survey was funded in part to describe the current status of screening  assessment  prevention and treatment for substance use  mental health  and hiv for youth on community supervision within the us juvenile justice system  surveys were administered to community supervision agencies and their primary behavioral healthcare providers  as well as the juvenile or family court judge with the largest caseload of youth on community supervision  this article presents the findings from the judges  survey  survey results indicated juvenile and family court judges were open to innovations for improving the court s performance  rated their relationships with collaborators highly  and appreciated the impact of screening  assessment  prevention  and treatment on judicial practices  
 judging communist crimes in romania  transnational and global influences in 2016  over 25 years after the fall of the communist regime  the romanian supreme court of justice convicted for the first time two former military officials for political crimes perpetrated in the 1950s  the harshest repressive period of the previous dictatorship  the verdicts marked a radical break with the prior legal approaches to prosecuting communist crimes in this country inasmuch as international criminal law  icl  was now employed in order to overcome impunity  this article shows how the current shifts in romanian jurisprudence have been built upon  and have drawn inspiration from  a recent global convergence towards the use of icl for addressing the crimes of dictatorial regimes and the obstacles to their prosecution  such as amnesties or statutory limitations  it emphasizes the importance of noncoercive exogenous influences in enabling changes in the romanian process of dealing with the past  
 judicial control of local protectionism in china  antitrust enforcement against administrative monopoly on the supreme people s court this article studies the rise of judicial review of local administrative monopolies in contemporary china  anticompetitive abuses of power by local party states  driven by corruption  have shaken the very foundations of the country s administrative unity and market efficiency  the entrenched skepticism of the authoritarian party state toward legal institutions notwithstanding  the supreme people s court in beijing has over the past decade steadily aggrandized its own and local courts  authority to constrain regional protectionist  collusive fiefdoms in ways unforeseen by the drafters of the landmark anti monopoly law  returning incremental but genuine benefits to the central party state  whose tacit acquiescence in judicial empowerment has over time transformed into express approval  however  given that administrative monopoly is instinct in a leninist polity  the central party state and the court should have few incentives to eradicate local protectionism once and for all  all things being equal  full fledged  independent judicial review of administrative monopoly will not emerge in china  
 judicial dialogue unpacked  twenty years of preliminary references on environmental matters initiated by the swedish judiciary judicial dialogue  as enabled through preliminary reference  is a fundamental component of the eu judicial system  it allows the national courts to ask the court of justice  ecj  questions of interpretation and validity of eu acts  thereby helping secure the coherence of eu law  as well as it safeguards judicial protection  especially for individual applicants who otherwise enjoy limited access to the ecj  the way this dialogue maps out in practice  however  is far from straightforward  examining preliminary references on environmental matters issued by the swedish courts over a twenty year period shows various dialogues taking place interchanged  gapped  interrupted and silenced each demonstrating a different response from the national courts in implementing the ecj s rulings  this finding raises pressing questions concerning the impact of preliminary rulings in the member states  the relationship between the national and the eu courts and whether judicial dialogues are effective guarantors of judicial protection  
 judicial disapproval as a constitutional technique i n this article  i consider judicial disapproval as a form of non binding review of the constitutionality of legislation  judicial disapproval is epitomized by the  declaration of incompatibility  a concept that is commonly thought to have been pioneered in the united kingdom in the 1990s  i show that the concept in fact has a considerably longer history  in the 1940s  the concept was envisaged and endorsed by britain s principal contributor to the drafting of the european convention on human rights  david maxwell fyfe  and by hersch lauterpacht in his work on the incorporation of an international bill of rights into national legal systems  variants on the concept were also examined and given some credence by american constitutional thinkers during the revolutionary era and the early republic  after considering the history of judicial disapproval as a constitutional technique  i offer some observations on the differences between judicial disapproval and marbury style judicial review  i conclude with a brief explanation as to why judicial disapproval is likely to persist as a form of rights review in the united kingdom  whatever the fate of the human rights act 1998  
 judicial uncertainties concerning territorial sea delimitation under article 15 of the united nations convention on the law of the sea recent international jurisprudence has shown considerable uncertainty with regard to the delimitation of the territorial sea  while international tribunals endorse a two stage approach to territorial sea delimitation  there is a lack of judicial consensus on the practical implementation of such an approach  this article argues that the rule exception relationship between equidistance and special circumstances  as reflected in the drafting history of losc article 15 and in jurisprudence prior to 2007  should inform the delimitation of the territorial sea  cases since 2007 which have strayed from the earlier jurisprudence on losc article 15  should be seen as a misconstruction of the law applicable to territorial sea delimitation  
 just another day in chancery lane  disorder and the law in london s legal quarter in the fifteenth century scarcely any turbulence  quarrels or disturbance ever occur there  but delinquents are punished with no other punishment than expulsion from communion with their society  which is a penalty they fear more than criminals elsewhere fear imprisonment and fetters  for a man once expelled from one of these societies is never received into the fellowship of any other of those societies  hence the peace is unbroken and the conversation of all of them is as the friendship of united folk  this was sir john fortescue s idealized account to the exiled prince of wales  edward of lancaster  of the peace loving nature of london s inns of court and chancery in the mid fifteenth century  fortescue was not concerned with the reality  which  as he knew all too well  was different  he was concerned with impressing on his young pupil the perfection of the english law and the education of its practitioners  rather than the imperfections that existed in a society that the prince  as he explicitly told him  would never experience  few who were familiar with the legal quarter that surrounded the inns would have recognized the arcadia that fortescue described  far from being the peaceful and well ordered district that the former chief justice invoked  in the period when he wrote the area to the west of london s temple bar was a liminal space  populated byamong otherslarge numbers of young trainee lawyers  in whom the kind of unruly behaviour otherwise also associated with the early universities  not least the western suburb s paris counterpart  the quartier latin to the south of the river seine  was endemic  among the most important factors that made it so was the very existence of the established  and to some extent tribal  all male societies of the inns of court and of chancery  at close quarters with the royal law courts and their heady mix of disputants and hired legal counsellors in permanent competition with each other  
 justifiable discrimination  the case of opposite sex civil partnerships opposite sex couples are prohibited from forming a civil partnership  following the introduction of same sex marriage  the civil partnership act 2004 was not extended to opposite sex couples  resulting in the unusual position that english law permits same sex couples access to two relationship forms  marriage and civil partnership  yet limits opposite sex couples to one  marriage   this discrimination was recently challenged in the courts by an opposite sex couple  rebecca steinfeld and charles keidan  who wish to enter a civil partnership owing to their deeply rooted ideological opposition to marriage  rejecting marriage as a patriarchal institution and believing that a civil partnership would offer a more egalitarian public expression of their relationship  the couple argued that the current ban constitutes a breach of article 14 read in conjunction with article 8 of the european convention on human rights  
 juvenile solitary confinement as a form of child abuse placing incarcerated juveniles into solitary confinement continues to occur in certain states of the united states  despite the accumulating evidence that it may cause substantial psychological damage to the teenagers who must endure it  the practice has been widely condemned by professional and human rights organizations  amid a growing appreciation of the immaturity and vulnerability of the adolescent brain  although several states and the federal government have been successful in abolishing or dramatically reducing the use of juvenile solitary confinement  it remains common practice in many facilities  clinicians working in correctional facilities where juvenile solitary confinement is employed are therefore faced with difficult questions of ethics  as to how best to balance their competing duties  and how to respond to such state sanctioned ill treatment of their patients  given the emerging consensus around the psychological damage wrought by sustained solitary confinement  clinicians may well reach the difficult conclusion that they are both legally mandated and ethically bound to file a report of suspected child abuse  such a report would be unlikely to be investigated for administrative reasons  but it would allow clinicians to communicate the gravity of their concern effectively  
 keep calm and causation on  reframing causation analysis in private section 1 antitrust actions at summary judgment a private plaintiff s ability to enforce antitrust violations critically hinges upon proof that the plaintiffs injury was in fact caused by the defendant s antitrust violation a deceptively simple requirement  this note traces the history of the treatment of the causation element in private section i antitrust conspiracy claims  as well as the differing approaches courts apply to the causation element when ruling on motions for summary judgment in section i cases  in particular  this note elaborates on how the adoption and use of the traditional tort law concept of causation in antitrust  as well as the heightened standards found in unrelated antitrust inquiries  has rendered federal courts incapable of properly examining economic evidence of causation  this note advocates for more procedurally prudent court practices when assessing the causation element in pretrial rulings  such practices are intended to hold courts accountable for verifying that a section i plaintiff has sound evidence of causation before a case reaches a jury  while also ensuring that courts do not go beyond their role as gatekeepers when ruling on motions for summary judgment  
 keep your bias to yourself  how deliberating with differently biased others affects mock jurors  guilt decisions  perceptions of the defendant  memories  and evidence interpretation this experiment explored how mock jurors   n   648  guilt decisions  perceptions of the defendant  memories  and evidence interpretation varied as a function of jury type and pretrial publicity  ptp   utilizing a 2  jury type  pure ptp vs  mixed ptp  x 3  ptp  defendant  victim  and irrelevant  factorial design  mock juries  n   126  were composed of jurors exposed to the same type of ptp  pure ptp  e g   defendant ptp  or different types of ptp  mixed ptp  e g   half exposed to defendant ptp and half to irrelevant ptp   before deliberations jurors exposed to defendant ptp were most likely to vote guilty  while those exposed to victim ptp were least likely  after deliberations  jury type and ptp affected jurors  guilt decisions  specifically  jurors deliberating on pure ptp juries had verdict distributions that closely resembled the predeliberation distributions  the verdict distributions of jurors on mixed ptp juries suggested that jurors were influenced by those they deliberated with  jurors not exposed to ptp appeared to incorporate bias from ptp exposed jurors  only ptp had significant effects on postdeliberation measures of memory and evidence interpretation  mediation analyses revealed that evidence interpretation and defendant credibility assessments mediated the effect of ptp on guilt ratings  taken together these findings suggest that during deliberations ptp bias can spread to jurors not previously exposed to ptp  in addition  juries composed of jurors exposed to different ptp slants  as opposed to a single ptp slant  can result in less biased decisions  finally  deliberating with others who do not share similar biases may have little  if any  impact on biased evidence interpretation or memory errors  
 language and international criminal justice in africa  interpretation at the ictr in this article  i examine the naturalized politics of language in international criminal justice in africa  based on research conducted during three visits to the international criminal tribunal for rwanda  ictr  between 2005 and 2008  though existing research has demonstrated the role of interpretation as meaningful  not technical  in domestic bilingual courts and other non african international criminal tribunals  it remains underexamined in courts affecting africa  i argue that ideas that the law and court actors had about language and about rwandans  language practices are important sites for understanding the constitution of justice and injustice  i use case proceedings to demonstrate how legal and linguistic interpretations are deeply imbricated at the ictr  and show how problems of translation emerged for the parties themselves  more analysis is needed of interpretation within contemporary international criminal tribunals related to africa to more fully examine complex dynamics of international legal regimes and justice affecting africa  
 law and habits while considerable work has been devoted to delineating the ways in which practices may give rise to legal norms  far less attention has been paid to the patterns of repeated behaviour that feed  and result from  such practices  for  as shapiro puts it   habits are not the    sort of things that can impose obligations   this article first exposes the dualist presuppositions that underlie such a statement  then highlights both the conceptual and normative benefits that flow from developing a non reductive naturalist understanding of the two way relationship between law and habits  the article argues that such a naturalist account  for which hart had clear intellectual affinities  is necessary to make sense of one of hart s key insights  because of the specificity of its institutional structure  an established legal system is conducive to a society that is  deplorably  and perilously  sheeplike   
 law in the anthropocene epoch humans and the effects of their activities now substantially influence the entire planet  including its oceans  climate  atmosphere  and lands  human influence has become so large that earth scientists have debated whether to identify a new geologic time period  the anthropocene  the anthropocene will surely have substantial effects on society and economies  and law will be no exception  the anthropocene is the product of the aggregation of billions of individual human actions  the impact of which is exponentially increasing because of growing technological advances and population  humans will inevitably respond to the anthropocene  if only to adapt to the significant changes in oceans  climate  biodiversity  and other critical functions upon which society depends  these responses will ineluctably lead to greater government involvement in a wide range of human activities and the constant updating of government laws and regulations to respond to new challenges  the result will put pressure on a wide range of legal doctrines in public and private law  including torts  property  constitutional  administrative  and criminal law  these changes will parallel similar revolutionary legal changes associated with industrialization and the development of a national economy in the united states in the nineteenth and twentieth centuries  just as with those legal changes  the legal changes of the anthropocene will put pressure on normative commitments at the heart of american law  including the classical liberal paradigm that government intrusion into individual action should be the exception  rather than the norm  managing the impacts of these legal changes will be a key challenge for the legal system in the next century  
 law libraries and the future of public access to born digital government information as government publications have shifted from print to electronic  mechanisms for guaranteeing the public s right to access government information have not kept pace  because legal resources are among the publications most at risk of loss  law libraries should participate in efforts to ensure that born digital government information remains freely available to all  
 leadership crimes the law of mass atrocity readily recognizes that responsibility and punishment for the world s worst horrors campaigns of displacement  rape  torture  and killing ought to fall primarily on the political  military  or community leaders who bring about these systematic crimes  but the international criminal courts that try and punish these individuals tell a narrow story about the harms perpetrated by leaders of mass crime  it is a story of leaders who abuse the power that derives from the coercive structures of government and governance from hierarchy  from the capacity to order and punish subordinates  from the ability to force bureaucracies and institutions into service of violence  this account is not inaccurate  but it is grossly incomplete  the law ought to ascribe responsibility to leaders not only for these abuses of coercive power  but also for their acts of moral persuasion using their positions of influence to guide  persuade  and convince others of the necessity  or even the rightness  of wrongdoing  moral persuasion is a familiar and destructive phenomenon  it is hitler convincing germans of the  jewish peril  and rwandan politicians warning hutus that tutsis cannot be trusted  it forms a crucial component of many situations of mass atrocity  for it transforms ordinary citizens into willing executioners  ready to carry out leaders  devastating plans  and yet  the idea of moral persuasion is largely missing from both legal scholarship and judicial practice  this article presents a broad new understanding of leadership and crime by undertaking the first deep investigation of the topic  it offers three contributions   1  a novel descriptive account of how the law of mass atrocity addresses the culpability of leaders   2  a theoretical understanding of why this body of law overlooks leaders  crimes of moral persuasion  and  3  a normative claim for why moral persuasion crimes should be recognized as a source of culpability for leaders  attending to the full harms of mass atrocity crime including the moral  psychic  and societal wounds it leaves behind requires a complete understanding of its formula  accordingly  this article argues for the recognition of moral persuasion as a critical repair to a system that is preoccupied with formal power  anxious about the perverse ordinariness of extraordinary crime  and in need of deeper connection with the reality of the horrors it addresses  
 leadership in law this article argues that the occupation that produces the nation s greatest share of leaders needs to do more to prepare them for that role  attention is long overdue  over two thirds of americans think that the nation has a leadership crisis  and only a small minority have trust in lawyers  particularly those in leadership roles  to promote a deeper understanding of what is lacking  this article summarizes key insights from contemporary leadership research  part i explores what is known about the qualities and styles that make for effective leadership  part ii surveys what is known about how lawyers can develop those capabilities  part iii looks at diversity in leadership and describes barriers that stand in the way for women lawyers and lawyers of color  part iv looks at the legacy of leaders and what can promote their effectiveness  
 learning from cross border reproduction drawing upon the preliminary findings of an australian empirical project on cross border reproduction  cbr   this article argues that regulators and policymakers could learn from the experiences of those who travel overseas in order to access fertility treatment and surrogacy  it makes four principal observations  first  the distinction between so called  altruistic  and  commercial  gamete donation and surrogacy is increasingly unsustainable and is not experienced as meaningful by many participants in cbr  secondly  the status of the law in cbr is profoundly equivocal  for participants it is often there and not there at the same time  thirdly  self sourced information  from the internet and more specifically social media such as facebook  is now the principal source of information and peer support for reproductive travellers  fourthly  and relatedly  domestic reproductive services providers are often sidestepped  if one of the goals of regulation is to minimise the risk of harm to participants  it is not clear that it is currently achieving this aim  and this article argues that any reforms will only work if they are more responsive to the reality of cbr  
 learning western techniques of empire  republican china and the new legal framework for managing tibet at the end of the nineteenth century  china found itself torn between its imperial past and its nation state future  by the time it became a republic in 1911  china had to redefine its territory in new national sovereign terms  until then its territory had been inscribed in more malleable frontiers and boundaries within the normative framework of the so called tribute system   the article shows how  applying the new legal techniques of empire learned from the west  the chinese central government  wherever possible  attempted to expand its new sovereign domain in territories like tibet  xinjiang  and mongolia  where  according to international law  all the prerequisites existed for national self determination and independence  in the context of opposing british and tibetan claims  the chinese appropriation of international law in the republican period  1911 1949  helped china not only to assert itself in the international domain as a sovereign state  defending itself against western imperialism  but also to pursue its own fictional imperial claims over tibet  without which the communists  liberation  of tibet would have not been possible  the paper highlights the interplay of imperial techniques based on international law  the relativity of this legal language  and how the strategies of empire are not only a prerogative of the west  but can be quickly adopted by those who have been subjected to them  resulting in a vicious circle  
 legal dimensions to valuing aesthetics in world heritage decisions this article reveals the ways in which concepts associated with the humanities inform determinations of outstanding universal  aesthetic value of natural heritage under the world heritage convention  language derived from humanistic ideas of beauty  the sublime and the picturesque  together with a range of images  are used in world heritage deliberations to describe nature from  in the words of the treaty  an aesthetic point of view   however  a preference for scientific method  masks the use of humanistic approaches  impeding the development of critical approaches that could enhance world heritage determinations  the deliberate use of humanistic methods and images to judge environmental aesthetics would  the article contends  facilitate critical inquiry without falling foul the principle of legality    an international legal requirement of international bodies such as the world heritage committee to act in accordance with the powers conferred on them by the states parties under a treaty  
 legal fragmentation  extraterritoriality and uncertainty in global financial regulation this article explores the reasons for legal fragmentation and extraterritoriality in the global regulation of finance  it shows that duplicative and overreaching rules are not necessarily the result of regulatory competition in which egoistic states undercut the rules of others in order to improve their position  an equally pivotal problem that global financial regulation has to cope with is uncertainty  such uncertainty exists with regard to the right measures for achieving financial stability and with regard to the willingness and ability of other states to adopt them  the article analyses approaches to overcoming legal fragmentation while maintaining global financial stability  it suggests that there is no alternative to a collaborative approach  using intensified regulatory dialogue  a broadening of the information base and deference to other states  rules  in order to improve the current mechanism  it proposes the introduction of multinational panels to assess whether regulatory and supervisory set ups of two or more states lead to comparable outcomes  in which case they must be recognised as being  equivalent  or  substituted compliant   
 legal mobilization within the bureaucracy  disability rights and the implementation of antidiscrimination law in sweden this article argues that the analysis of legal mobilization needs to give more attention to the state and its relationship with social movements in order to examine how the state either sustains social movements  demands or is a field of contention for those demands  focusing on how disability bureaucrats and activists mobilize antidiscrimination law in sweden  this article shows that two main factors shape legal mobilization within the bureaucracy and alter the state s ability to become a legal mobilization actor   1  the institutional relationships between social movement organizations and government agencies and  2  the profiles and careers of bureaucrats and activists  it concludes by suggesting several lines for further research on law and social movements in nonpluralist countries  
 legal pluralism  gendered discourses  and hybridity in land titling practices in cambodia this article describes and analyses the tensions  ambivalence  and hybridity that prevail in the nexus between discourses of gender and the legal pluralism of the new  formalized  and customary ways of handling land titles  based on empirical research in cambodia  it reveals a number of mechanisms  challenges  and inconsistencies in the practice of land titling  foremost  the practice of titling seems to be highly informed by local discourses of marriage  family  gender  and age  which all affect to whom land is assigned  this leaves a hybrid construction in the nexus between statutory law and customary practices  the article departs from this observation and adds three contributions on a theoretical level to existing research  by incorporating the dimensions of discourse analysis and legal hybridity  by linking the concept of legal pluralism to the process of hybridization  and by introducing the notion of hybridity of implementation as a supplement to hybridity of law  
 legal research instruction and law librarianship in china  an updated view of current practices and a comparison with the us legal education system this article follows up on liying yu s 2008 survey exploring the state of legal research instruction in chinese law schools  the updated survey revisits the state of legal research instruction in china  explores several aspects not previously addressed  and discusses broader issues relevant to law librarianship in china such as management models  funding  staffing  and law librarian faculty status  
 legality of unilateral exploitation of space resources under international law in recent years  there has been a surge of private investment in space resources and the enactment of domestic legislation aimed at protecting property rights over the resources to be extracted  this article argues that the unilateral exploitation of space resources is not prohibited by the principle of non appropriation and is consistent with the freedom of use for common benefit and interests  with the caveat that it does not exclude others from exploitation or exacerbate inequality among states  it also argues that a laissez faire approach would be detrimental to the orderly  sustainable and safe exploitation and use of space resources and calls for the establishment of an international regulatory regime consisting of rules concerning international coordination  benefits sharing and environmental protection  
 legalized rent seeking  eminent domain in kazakhstan kazakhstan ranks consistently low on measures of property rights protection and the rule of law more generally  1  echoing these evaluations  existing literature emphasizes the degree to which informal institutions shape property relations in personalist  authoritarian regimes  like kazakhstan  the expectation is that formal institutions like law and courts fail to restrain or otherwise influence state agents  rent seeking behavior  in effect  they serve primarily as ornamentation  regardless  these explanations fail to explain why both citizens and the state regularly turn to these institutions to settle property disputes  this article focuses on conflicts over eminent domain and finds that in these cases the law provides lower and upper bounds for officials  rent seeking behavior  within these limits  law combines with informal practices to determine legal outcomes  although the law and courts sometimes provide citizens with opportunities for limited redress  they also help facilitate and legitimize officials  use of eminent domain for personal enrichment  
 legitimacy in redd plus governance in indonesia this paper addresses the question of legitimacy in redd  governance in indonesia  it develops a legitimacy framework that builds on elements of scharpf  j eur pub policy 4 1  18 36  1997  input and output legitimacy concept and the political economy lens described by brockhaus and angelsen  analysing redd   challenges and choices  cifor  bogor  2012   using data collected through key informant interviews and focus groups  we identify and explore stakeholder perceptions of legitimacy  the analysis reveals a complex interplay between input and output legitimacy  finding that state  non state and hybrid actors perceive output legitimacy  i e  project outcomes  as highly dependent on the level of input legitimacy achieved during the governance process  non state actors perceive proxies for input legitimacy  such as participation and inclusion of local people  as goals in themselves  in the main  they perceive inclusion to be integral to the empowerment of local people  they perceive output legitimacy as less important because of the intangibility of redd  outcomes at this stage in the process  the findings also highlight the challenges associated with measuring the legitimacy of redd  governance in indonesia  
 les jeux sont faits  comparative law as it really was meant to be  this invited commentary offers a number of reflections in response to a recent article by pierre legrand  in that article  several frontlines are drawn between what legrand considers the right and the wrong ways of doing comparative law  the following commentary tries to make sense of both the origin and direction of what oftentimes comes across as an overly harsh and even polemical critique of different scholars who are active in the field  
 let them frye  frye hearings for determination of  mental disorders  in the sexually violent persons act specific laws aimed at the confinement of mentally disabled sexually violent persons have existed for years  originally  these laws aimed to rehabilitate a person within a mental hospital and help him with his disorders  aiming to help him enter back into society  however  throughout the years  the laws morphed into ways to keep convicted criminals from society after their prison sentence ended for fear of potential future crimes  in illinois  the courts find a man falls within the sexually violent persons law when he remains too dangerous to be released after his criminal confinement  a person must have a  mental disorder  to fall under this law  and questions remain on how these disorders are established in illinois  a psychologist often makes a  mental disorder diagnosis   this comment argues the state should have the psychologist qualified as an expert using a frye hearing before the expert can classy the person with a  mental disorder  within the sexually violent persons law  this way  the person is classified using a legal classification  not just the prevailing psychological definition of the day  
 lgbt identity and crime recent studies report that lgbt adults and youth disproportionately face hardships that are risk factors for criminal offending and victimization  some of these factors include higher rates of poverty  overrepresentation in the youth homeless population  and overrepresentation in the foster care system  despite these risk factors  there is a lack of study and available data on lgbt people who come into contact with the criminal justice system as offenders or as victims  through an original intellectual history of the treatment of lgbt identity and crime  this article provides insight into how this problem in lgbt criminal justice developed and examines directions to move beyond it  the history shows that until the mid 1970s  the criminalization of homosexuality left little room to think of lgbt people in the criminal justice system as anything other than deviant sexual offenders  the trend to decriminalize sodomy in the mid 1970s opened a narrow space for scholars  advocates  and policymakers to use antidiscrimination principles to redefine lgbt people in the criminal justice system as innocent and nondeviant hate crime victims  as opposed to deviant sexual offenders  although this paradigm shift has contributed to some important gains for lgbt people  this article argues that it cannot be celebrated as an unequivocal triumph  this shift has left us with flat understandings of lgbt offenders as sexual offenders and flat understandings of lgbt victims as hate crime victims  these one dimensional narratives miss many criminal justice problems that especially fall on lgbt people who bear the brunt of inequality in the criminal justice system including lgbt people of color  transgender people  undocumented lgbt people  lgbt people living with hiv  and low income and homeless lgbt people  this article concludes by showing how ideas and methods in criminology offer promise to enhance accounts of lgbt offending and lgbt victimization  in turn  these enhanced accounts can inform law  policy  and the design of criminal justice institutions to better respond to the needs and experiences of lgbt offenders and lgbt victims  
 liability and compensation for oil spill accidents  international regime and its implementation in china marine oil spill accidents have long been caused by ship collisions  however  the proliferation of offshore oil and gas installations portends a marked increase in oil spills from these sources  this presents a unique enforcement challenge for international and chinese domestic systems for oil pollution liability and compensation that were developed in response to the threat of ship based oil pollution  this article focuses on how the international liability and compensation regime for oil pollution has been implemented in china  and whether a combination of the international regime and domestic chinese regulations could provide an adequate mechanism for holding offshore oil operators liable for accidents and for ensuring adequate compensation to injured parties  analysis of chinese law demonstrates that the current international liability and compensation regime for oil pollution  the 1992 civil liability convention  clc  international oil pollution compensation  iopc funds   has been only partially implemented in china and lacks domestic adaptation mechanisms  the clc iopc funds regime also does not extend to oil pollution accidents resulting from offshore operations  an international convention containing universal liability provisions for offshore oil spill accidents would require a long term process of joint international efforts  based on this international and domestic chinese legal environment  this article concludes that china should first develop a domestic liability and compensation mechanism that implements the international regime for ship source oil pollution in its entirety  but which also extends to pollution caused by offshore oil spills  
 liability for diagnosing malingering malingering is a medical diagnosis  but not a psychiatric disorder  the label imputes that an evaluee has intentionally engaged in false behavior or statements  by diagnosing malingering  psychiatrists pass judgment on truthfulness  evaluees taking exception to the label may claim that the professional has committed defamation of character  libel or slander  when the diagnosis is wrong and costs the claimant money or benefits  clinicians may counter by claiming immunity or that the diagnosis was made in good faith  this problem has come into focus in military and veterans  contexts  where diagnoses become thresholds for benefits  through historical and literary examples  case law  and military veterans  claims of disability and entitlement  the authors examine the potency of the malingering label and the potential liability for professionals and institutions of making this diagnosis  
 liability law under scientific uncertainty this article investigates the implications of uncertainty aversion on optimal liability law  of special interest is the case in which the causal link between conduct and harm is not known with certainty  as is frequently the case with toxic torts  under negligence  uncertainty aversion calls for a higher standard of care if  and only if  the safest prevention measures are also the most reliable ones  i e   they reduce the uncertainty perceived by the victim   strict liability dominates negligence when the injurer has lower degrees of uncertainty aversion than the victim and can formulate more precise estimates of the probability of harm  when harm is dispersed on a very large number of victims  however  negligence dominates independently of their degree of uncertainty aversion  
 liberty and the politics of balance  the undue burden test after casey hellerstedt whole woman s health v  hellerstedt represents the supreme court s most important intervention in the constitutional politics of abortion in more than a decade  however  as this article shows  hellerstedt does not represent the clean break some commentators identify  instead  the decision comes at the end of a decades long movement countermovement conflict about the meaning of an unconstitutional undue burden on a woman s right to abortion  positioning hellerstedt in historical context matters because doing so underscores the court s ongoing responsiveness to popular views of what the constitution says about abortion  the historical trends studied here reveal what will likely happen when the court applies hellerstedt to fetal protective  rather than woman protective  anti abortion laws  to maintain the delicate balance created by casey  the court should require evidence that both fetal protective and woman protective abortion regulations are substantially related to their stated goal  
 likelihood ratios for categorical evidence  comparison of lr models applied to gunshot residue data in this article a 2 levelmultinomial model for the calculation of likelihood ratios  lrs  as a measure of the strength of evidence in the case of categorical evidence is introduced  in order to illustrate its usage  it is applied to gunshot residue  gsr  comparison data obtained in an experimental set up and analysed using electron microscopy  the data consists of a number of gunshot residues divided in k categories depending on their elemental composition  for comparison a score based model  the pearson correlation  and a 1 levelmultinomial model estimated with maximum likelihood  ml  were also applied on the same data  three variations of the 2 level multinomial model were tested  together with the other two models  the results show that all tested models can be applied on categorical data such as gsr  the 2 level multinomial model  the model that is introduced in the study  shows the least misleading evidence  furthermore this article demonstrates a first step taken towards a system that calculates numerical lrs in gsr comparison studies  
 liminality and the limits of law in health research regulation  what are we missing in the spaces in between  this article fundamentally challenges the way in which law currently regulates human health research  it invokes the anthropological concept of liminality the quality of in between ness to suggest deeper ways of understanding ongoing challenges in delivering acceptable and effective regulation of research involving human participants  in stark contrast to the structural regulatory spaces constructed by law  the metaphor of the liminal space is explored to explain what is lost through our failure to see health research regulation as an inherently human experiential process  involving potentially profound transformative events for participants and researchers alike  the implications for the future of health research regulation are then examined  in particular  the analysis calls into question key features of the current regulatory paradigm  and demands that we reconsider our own demands of law in this context  the argument is made that health research is a liminal process and that we fail to treat it as such  this requires a rethink of corollary regulation also in processual terms  ultimately  the charge is to undertake a radical reimagining of regulatory space to accommodate and promote liminal regulatory spaces  
 limitless worker surveillance from the pinkerton private detectives of the 1850s  to the closed circuit cameras and email monitoring of the 1990s  to new apps that quantify the productivity of workers  and to the collection of health data as part of workplace wellness programs  american employers have increasingly sought to track the activities of their employees  starting with taylorism and fordism  american workers have become accustomed to heightened levels of monitoring that have only been mitigated by the legal counterweight of organized unions and labor laws  thus  along with economic and technological limits  the law has always been presumed as a constraint on these surveillance activities  recently  technological advancements in several fields big data analytics  communications capture  mobile device design  dna testing  and biometrics have dramatically expanded capacities for worker surveillance both on and off the job  while the cost of many forms of surveillance has dropped significantly  new technologies make the surveillance of workers even more convenient and accessible  and labor unions have become much less powerful in advocating for workers  the american worker must now contend with an all seeing argus panoptes built from technology that allows for the trawling of employee data from the internet and the employer collection of productivity data and health data  with the ostensible consent of the worker  this raises the question of whether the law still remains a meaningful avenue to delineate boundaries for worker surveillance  in this article  we start from the normative viewpoint that the right to privacy is not an economic good that may be exchanged for the opportunity for employment  we then examine the effectiveness of the law as a check on intrusive worker surveillance  given recent technological innovations  in particular  we focus on two popular trends in worker tracking productivity apps and worker wellness programs to argue that current legal constraints are insufficient and may leave american workers at the mercy of 24 7 employer monitoring  we consider three possible approaches to remedying this deficiency of the law   1  a comprehensive omnibus federal information privacy law  similar to approaches taken in the european union  which would protect all individual privacy to various degrees regardless of whether or not one is at work or elsewhere and without regard to the sensitivity of the data at issue   2  a narrower  sector specific employee privacy protection act  eppa   which would focus on prohibiting specific workplace surveillance practices that extend outside of work related locations or activities  and  3  an even narrower sector and sensitivity specific employee health information privacy act  ehipa   which would protect the most sensitive type of employee data  especially those that could arguably fall outside of the health insurance portability and accountability act s  hipaa  jurisdiction  such as wellness and other data related to health and one s personhood  
 lingering issues of foreign official immunity in enforcing prohibition against torture in domestic courts  pinochet s reasoning reassessed since the pinochet judgment in 1999  the torture exception to foreign official immunity in domestic courts increasingly seems to have acquired an established status  in order to better enforce prohibition against torture  the recent fifth report of the un international law commission s special rapporteur on immunity of state officials from foreign criminal jurisdiction casts this exception to state official immunity as a basically noncontroversial issue  but a deeper analysis of the reasoning originated by pinochet  against a backdrop of most recent scholarship  reveals a rather weak doctrinal foundation  the article explores the four main theories behind this exception claim  one after another  i e  jus cogens  universal jurisdiction  characterization of torture as a non official act  and dual responsibility for re categorized torture acts  and points out the problems therein  albeit without rushing into hasty solutions  
 linkages between exchange rate and economic growth in pakistan  an econometric approach  exchange rate has remained a debatable issue in association with economic growth  a very little common consensus could be developed amongst policy makers and economists  there is no unambiguous theoretical evidence which explains the impact of exchange rate on economic growth  in fact  both theories and evidences are diverging  most of the theories are emphasizing on explaining indirect relation between exchange rate and economic growth as exchange rate stimulates growth in terms of exports  investment and foreign direct investment  fdi   this study is an attempt to explore the relationship between exchange rate and economic growth in pakistan for period 1976 2010  using simultaneous equation model  employing two  three stage least square  2sls and 3sls  techniques and found that exchange rate has a positive association with economic growth through the channel of export promotion incentives  enlarging the volume of investment  enhancing fdi inflow and promoting import substitute industry  although  exchange rate is positively affecting economic growth  yet it can t be used as a policy tool  
 litigating extraterritorial nuisances under english common law and uk statute english common law and united kingdom legislation provide various   overall liberal   jurisdictional grounds for hearing foreign tort claims  the article examines these grounds with reference to recent and ongoing oil pollution nuisance litigation involving royal dutch shell plc and its nigerian subsidiary operating in the niger delta  particular attention is given to the factors taken into account by the court in exercising its discretion to allow service out of the jurisdiction in cases of pollution taking place abroad under the principle of forum non conveniens  following the widely commented decision of the united states supreme court in kiobel v  royal dutch petroleum corporation  which ruled against the extraterritorial application of the alien tort statute  it is easy to forget that the rules of jurisdiction vary from country to country and that different legal systems apply similar concepts in often radically different ways  attention is also given to the future development of english jurisdictional law and practice in the context of environmental nuisance  
 litigating indigenous peoples  rights in africa  potentials  challenges and limitations adopting a comparative analysis  this article examines some recent litigation which has focused on indigenous peoples  rights across the african continent  the aim is to explore both the potential and the challenges and limitations of litigation as a tool for supporting the rights of indigenous peoples  the article explores the extent to which a specific african jurisprudence is emerging on issues that are essential to indigenous peoples such as non discrimination  self identification  land rights and development  it also focuses on the practical issues that arise when engaging with litigation in order to explore the extent to which litigation can contribute to the legal empowerment of some of the most marginalized indigenous communities in africa  
 litigation and the timing of settlement  evidence from commercial disputes although an overwhelming proportion of all legal disputes end in settlement  the determinants of the timing of settlement remain empirically underexplored  we draw on a novel dataset on the duration of commercial disputes in slovenia to study how the timing of settlement is shaped by the stages and features of the litigation process  using competing risk regression analysis  we find that events such as court annexed mediation and the first court session  which enable the disputing parties to refine their respective expectations about the case outcome  in general reduce case duration to settlement  the magnitude of the respective effects  however  varies with time  completion of subsequent court sessions  in contrast  does not affect the time to settlement  judicial workload affects the timing of settlement indirectly  via the effect on the timing of the first court session  we also examine the effect of other case and party characteristics  
 litigation in the fossil fuel divestment movement the fossil fuel divestment movement has been described as the fastest growing disinvestment movement in history  and in recent years it has continued to expand  despite its growth  however  the movement has made little use of legal action  instead utilizing tactics of public pressure and persuasion  and the future role of litigation in the movement is unclear  to consider litigation s potential role in the movement and the challenges it may face  i examine the first and only case of litigation in the fossil fuel divestment movement thus far  harvard climate justice coalition et al  v president and fellows of harvard college et al   2015   in which seven harvard students  including the author  filed suit to compel the university to divest its endowment from fossil fuel companies  i examine motivations for filing the suit in the context of the broader fossil fuel divestment movement  the case s history  and the challenges faced by the suit  including arguments surrounding causation  particularization  representation of future generations  limiting principles  and framing  i then discuss potential opportunities for fossil fuel divestment litigation in the future  as the field of climate change law develops further  litigation over fossil fuel investments could grow in frequency and importance  
 local governance and redistributive policy  explaining local funding for public defense in many american states  public defense is provided at the county rather than state level  langton   farole 2009   local governments have discretion over implementing and funding the right to counsel  resulting in considerable variability in programs and funding levels  placing this issue in the theoretical context of redistributive policies and politics  we investigate decisions on funding this service across upstate new york counties  using as a point of departure paul peterson s classic explication of community politics  we first model variation in funding as a function of counties  fiscal capacity  need for services  and costs of supplying legal representation  we also test peterson s prediction that local political factors will play little if any role in budget decisions  second  through interviews with program administrators we explore the characters of twelve defender programs in which expenditures departed from the model s predictions  we find that three factors which we term  influence    infrastructure   and  ideas  also vary directly with levels of funding  we conclude with a discussion of the implications of these findings for theoretical thinking about due process policies and local politics  and for policy debate over how best to ensure adequate counsel in criminal court  
 logical but incompetent plea decisions  a new approach to plea bargaining grounded in cognitive theory although much research considers the cognitive processes involved in legal decision making of jurors and judges  decisions to accept or reject plea bargains have received far less attention  we examine decisions in plea scenarios to test predictions of fuzzy trace theory regarding how cognitive processing style  specifically  greater reliance on gist or verbatim representations  affects plea decisions and how this could lead to suboptimal decision making  especially among defendants who are young adults  results support fuzzy trace theory s predictions by showing that the type of mental representation relied on by an individual  gist or verbatim  predicts plea bargain decisions with those relying on gist being more influenced by categorical meaning based distinctions  such as being guilty versus innocent or getting a felony versus misdemeanor  importantly  results suggest that differences between the 2 groups are not caused by a difference in values but by the fact that individuals relying on verbatim representations are making decisions that do not reflect their underlying values  due to a  hyper rational  reasoning process  these results reveal a new threat to competent plea decisions a logical reasoning process that is arguably not fully competent which has implications for the current plea bargaining system  
 long term economic benefits of psychological interventions for criminality  comparing and integrating estimation methods policymakers have been increasingly interested in psychological interventions for criminality that are both evidence based and financially sustainable  yet the best method for estimating long term economic benefits of reductions in crime remains unclear  the present study evaluated two modifications of a cost benefit analysis model from the washington state institute for public policy  i e   wsipp model  that calculated long term benefits using  1  an expansive method based on year by year arrest rates and  2  a summary method based on average arrest rates over the follow up period  more specifically  we applied the expansive method to data from previously published studies that had estimated summary economic benefits for  a  a 25 year follow up of multisystemic therapy  mst  and  b  a 9 year follow up of mst for problem sexual behaviors  mst psb   results indicated that  a  estimated benefits were more conservative  i e   negatively biased  yet more stable  i e   less variable  under the summary method versus the expansive method and  b  excluding years of follow up with high amounts of missing data resulted in modest increases in stability under the expansive method  although negative bias of the summary method was also less pronounced in this analysis  given the complementary strengths and limitations of the expansive and summary methods  we recommend an integrative approach that synthesizes results across both methods to yield more balanced conclusions  implications of these findings for researchers  policymakers  and public service agencies are discussed  
 looking back  looking forward  feminist legal scholarship in sls this article offers a review of shifts in feminist legal theory since the early 1990s  we first use our respective histories and fields of expertise to provide a brief overview and highlight some key themes within feminist legal theory  we then examine social   legal studies  sls   asking whether it has met its key goal of integrating feminist analyses at every level  our review suggests that sls has offered many important contributions to feminist legal scholarship but has not fulfilled its lofty goal of integrating feminist analyses at every level of scholarship  it features feminist work quite consistently and some degree of mainstreaming is evident  as is the international reach of sls  too many articles fail  however  to incorporate or even mention feminist approaches  we end with thoughts about  and hopes for  the future of legal feminism  examining efforts to revitalize the field and suggesting possible directions for the future  
 loss based retributive justifications of punishment retributive justifications of punishment that focus on the gain of offenders  like those offered by herbert morris and jeffrie murphy  have been subjected to sustained and persuasive criticism  three authors  daniel mcdermott  richard lippke and goran duus otterstrom  have  in their fairly recent works  offered retributive justifications of punishment that focus instead on the loss suffered by victims  i will argue that these loss based justifications  despite their ingenuity  suffer from serious defects  
 loyal opposition and the political constitution in studying parliament  special attention is regularly awarded to the interactions between government and commons  with the commons identified as a singular body  united in its claims against or in support of the government  these and other commonplace understandings trade on an insufficiently political study of the constitution  highlighted by the relative neglect of the official opposition in public law thought  with the aim of rehabilitating the place of her majesty s loyal opposition in political and constitutional theory  this article explores the historical rise and present day constitutional responsibilities of the opposition  it highlights how government and opposition are carried on by agreement and how the opposition s critical function is channelled  facilitated and complicated by its pursuit of office  
 making doctrinal work more rigorous  lessons from systematic reviews legal scholars  lawyers  and judges frequently make positive claims about the state of legal doctrine  yet despite the profligate citation norms of legal writing  these claims are often supported in  a somewhat imprecise way such that the exact evidence is unclear or difficult for others to probe or falsify  in response to similar issues  other disciplines have developed  methodological standards for conducting  systematic reviews  that summarize the state of knowledge on a given subject  in this essay we argue that methods for performing systematic reviews that are specifically tailored to legal analysis should be developed  we propose a simple four step process that could be used whenever someone is trying to make objective claims about the state of legal doctrine  and we illustrate the value of this method by applying it to doctrinal claims that have been made in recent legal scholarship  
 making money  coin  currency and the coming of capitalism this essay argues that christine desan s making money  coin  currency and the coming of capitalism intervenes decisively in debates over the origin of money  while making a fundamental contribution to the legal history of money  the philosophy of money  and the history of capitalism  desan shows money to be a mode of governance  created by rulers to extend their power  and maintained and managed by their successors  she argues that british politicians reinvented money at the end of the seventeenth century  creating the essential institutional basis for contemporary capitalism  the essay builds on desan s analysis  showing how the tools she develops to understand the origins and development of british money can help us explain the expansion of capitalism  and the transition to capitalism associated with the american revolution  
 making strategic choices  how and why indian groups advocated for federal recognition from 1977 to 2012 how and why do groups employ law strategically in different venues  this article combines theoretical and methodological insights from sociolegal and interest group studies to investigate how and why nonfederally recognized indian groups used administrative and legislative strategies for federal recognition from 1977 to 2012  by detailing the circumstances leading indian groups to employ varying strategies  it provides a more nuanced understanding of the dynamic interplay among the goals  motivations  and constraints influencing groups to use administrative and legislative processes over time  
 making trade policy great again  what policymakers should learn from trump s election donald trump s election as president of the united states  hereinafter  u s    of america offers a cautionary tale about how trade policy depends on the continuous support of citizens and politicians  trade liberalisation advocates should ask themselves whether traditional policies are so detached from the reality of citizens  quotidian concerns that they can be easily instrumentalised for electoral gain  there is a disconnect between international trade policies and domestic concerns  with many citizens seeing themselves as the losers of the international trade game  pro trade politicians and policymakers should acknowledge that trade policy benefits countries as a whole but makes some citizens richer and others poorer  revitalising consensus on trade policy among political circles and the community at large requires looking back  underlining the good things that trade liberalisation has achieved   but also looking forward  devising new ways of making trade policies more inclusive and equitative for everyone  
 malpractice in paediatric minimally invasive surgery   a current concept  results of an international survey this study aimed to assess malpractice in paediatric minimally invasive surgery  mis   and attitudes  prevention strategies and mechanisms to support surgeons while they are under investigation  an observational  multicentric  questionnaire based study was conducted  the survey questionnaire was sent via mail  and it comprised four sections  twenty four paediatric surgeons  average age 54 6 years   from 13 different countries  participated in this study  the majority had  15 years of experience in mis  three  12 5   surgeons reported a total of five malpractice claims regarding their mis activity  the reasons for the claims were a postoperative complication in 3 5  60   cases  a delayed failed diagnosis in 1 5  20   cases and the death of the patient in 1 5  20   cases  the claims concluded with the absolution of the surgeon in all cases  and monetary compensation to the claimant in two  40   cases  eleven  45 8   surgeons were invited as expert counsels in medico legal actions  medico legal aspects have a minimal impact on the mis activity of paediatric surgeons  in this series  claims concluded with the absolution of the surgeon in all cases  but they had a negative effect on the surgeon s reputation and finances  a key element in supporting surgeons while they are under investigation is always to choose a surgeon who is an expert in paediatric mis as legal counsel  a constant update on innovations in paediatric mis and appropriate professional liability insurance may also play a key role in reducing medico legal consequences  
 malpractice  criminality  and medical regulation  reforming the role of the gmc in fitness to practise panels a recent law commission review emphasised that medical fitness to practise panels  also called medical practitioners tribunals  are an important legal mechanism for ensuring that public trust in medical regulation is maintained when a complaint is made against a doctor  this article examines trends over time in panel outcomes to identify their effectiveness in ensuring public protection  although a rise in complaints  and a change from the criminal to civil standard of proof  has not led to more doctors being struck off the medical register  increasingly action is being taken to provide advice  issue warnings  and agree rehabilitative forms of action with doctors  it is argued that these trends are congruent with the broader adoption of a risk based approach to professional regulation  legal reforms to maintain public trust must ensure that the shift towards risk averse forms of professional accountability do not sacrifice public safety and due process for the sake of political pragmatic exigency  
 managing from the middle  frontline supervisors and perceptions of their organizational power frontline supervisors serve in a critical role  maintaining relationships between upper management and frontline workers  however  we still know relatively little about how subordinates view their power in relation to their supervisors and how frontline supervisors understand and exercise their own power  focusing on street level workers and frontline supervisors across a statewide community corrections agency  we explore perceptions  experiences  and assertions of power in the workplace  using focus groups with thirty two street level probation and parole officers and focus groups and field observations of seventy five frontline supervisors  we find that officers and frontline supervisors have widely differing views on the power of the frontline supervisory position  some of which are influenced by gender  while street level workers align frontline supervisors with policy creators  frontline supervisors view themselves as disempowered go betweens  frontline supervisors compensate for their perceived lack of power in policymaking and implementation by using micropower strategies to assert their power  this study extends street level bureaucrat theory to the role of frontline supervisors  who in practice are distant from the upper management roles with which they are typically categorized  
 marriages and other unions in private international law   separate but equal  many legal systems not only know the concept of marriage but also the one of non marital registered unions  even though the requirements concerning who can conclude the one or the other union differ  especially regarding the sex of the partners  at the conflict of laws level  most countries show the same approach  i e  providing two different rules for the validity of each institution  using the examples of belgian and the german law  both having very different substantive rules but very similar private international law rules  we show that this distinction itself leads to problems for international couples   even within the european union   and contradicts the general approach which private international law has regarding the characterization of unknown foreign concepts  inspired by the 1978 hague marriage convention and several national approaches  we propose one broad conflict of laws rule for marital and non marital unions  leaving substantive values to the public policy exception

 meanings of treason in a colonial context  indian challenges to the charges of  waging war against the king  and  crimes against peace  in november 1945  the british colonial authorities convened a court martial of members of the indian national army  which had fought alongside the japanese in the asia pacific war  three defendants were charged with waging war against the king    the equivalent of treason  set out in section 121 of the indian penal code  at the heart of the case was the question of allegiance  the chief defence counsel  bhulabhai desai  had the task of presenting a legitimate   i e   non treasonable   exception to the duty of allegiance to a state during a war  drawing on hobbesian themes  desai insisted that a specific event   the fall of singapore   had convinced the surrendered indian troops of the british army that britain was no longer capable of protecting their interests  further  he questioned the very premise of the waging war against the king  charge  by arguing that during a war of liberation the justice of the challenger eclipsed the security of the challenged  desai s approach influenced radhabinod pal  who would take these arguments to the international military tribunal for the far east  pal  like desai  took as his starting point the differing interests of the powerful states and their colonies  he argued that the allies  motives for creating the new charge of crimes against peace  were highly suspect  considering their own history of violence towards the non western world  would it not potentially immobilize the struggle against colonialism  and  pace hobbes  could not a colonized state s duty of allegiance to the society of states be relinquished  
 measuring multi level regulatory governance  organizational proliferation  coordination  and concentration of influence as regulation increasingly results from the interplay of a wide array of different actors operating at different levels  it has become crucial to focus on how these constellations of regulatory actors operate  although this research field presents huge potential for theoretical development  we still lack the measurement techniques to allow systematic comparative research  we contribute to filling this gap with four indices measuring crucial characteristics of multi actor regulatory arrangements   i  the scope of organizational proliferation   ii  the extent of coordination between regulatory actors   iii  the amount of influence that each individual regulatory actor has on the sector regulation  and  iv  the extent to which the regulatory influence is concentrated in the hands of one or a few actors  we argue that our indices are sufficiently systematic  reliable  and flexible to be applied in a variety of research contexts relating to multi level and multi actor regulatory governance  
 measuring the creative plea bargain a great deal of criminal law scholarship and practice turns on whether a defendant gets a good deal through plea bargaining  but what is a good deal  and how do defense attorneys secure such deals  much scholarship measures plea bargains by one metric  how many years the defendant receives at sentencing  in the era of collateral consequences  however  this is no longer an adequate metric as it misses a world of bargaining that happens outside of the sentence  through empirical research  this article examines the measure of a good plea and the work that goes into negotiating such a plea  through in depth interviews with twenty five public defenders in four states  i investigate the ways in which collateral consequences impact the negotiation of the plea  what emerges is a picture of creative plea bargaining that takes into account a host of noncriminal sanctions that fall outside of the charge and sentence  public defenders assess the priorities of their clients regarding both the direct and collateral consequences of the case and piece together pleas that meet these varied needs  the length of sentence after a plea does not tell the full story about whether a defendant got a good deal because a successful plea now encompasses much beyond the final sentence  these findings have broad implications for the way we think about assessing public defense offices and individual defenders  much of what goes into a plea particularly at the misdemeanor level is a product of the client s desire to avoid certain collateral consequences  and those desires generally do not enter the formal record or off the record negotiations with prosecutors  as a result  pleas that look bad on paper may actually be meeting the needs of the client  therefore  in order to assess pleas and the defenders who negotiate them  we must understand the limits of publicly available data and focus on creating a more robust data set by which to judge public defenders  additionally  this article provides a fuller picture of prevailing professional norms at the plea phase after padilla  lafler  and frye  as courts grapple with the role of the defense attorney during plea bargaining  it is critical that they understand that in many cases lawyers achieve optimal outcomes by providing advice and advocacy for their clients on concerns outside of the immediate criminal case  finally  this article serves as a renewed call for attention and funding for the holistic model of public defense  
 measuring the rule of law  a comparison of indicators the rule of law era has given rise to multiple indicators purporting to measure the concept  this article compares four major indicators of the rule of law and shows that their approaches to conceptualization and measurement differ  given their disparate conceptualizations and measurement strategies  one might expect a weak correlation between them  strikingly  however  all four indicators are highly correlated with each other  with the pair wise correlations between three of them exceeding 0 95   they are also correlated with the widely used measure of corruption  this suggests that the indicators might capture a more encompassing concept  like impartial administration  the article critiques the rule of law measurement enterprise as insufficiently linked to the underlying normative concept  it points to the reliance on expert perceptions and information constraints as a possible cause for the convergence  it concludes that measurement strategy  rather than differences in conceptualization  explains the convergence between the indicators  
 mechanisms of unexpected death and autopsy findings in friedreich ataxia a 36 year old woman with a clinical history of friedreich ataxia and hypertrophic cardiomyopathy was found unexpectedly dead at her home  the heart showed asymmetric left ventricular hypertrophy  with an interventricular septal thickness of 20 25mm  the remainder of the left ventricular wall measured 15mm   histologically  both ventricles had irregular areas of marked myocyte hypertrophy with associated interstitial fibrosis and focal myofibre disarray  there was neuronal loss within the dentate nucleus of the cerebellum  with vacuolation and axonal loss in the dorsal columns and spinocerebellar tracts of the upper cervical spinal cord  death was due to hypertrophic cardiomyopathy complicating friedreich ataxia  other causes of death in this condition include embolic stroke  cerebral haemorrhage  aspiration pneumonia  renal failure  diabetic ketoacidosis  myocardial infarction  generalised inanition and trauma  sudden death due to cardiac disease  resulting in presentation for medicolegal autopsy  may be the presenting feature at all ages  including childhood  
 media  marriage  and the construction of the lgbt legal agenda legal and sociolegal scholars have argued that social movement litigation often generates social change indirectly by drawing publicity and public attention to movement issues  yet some cases are more likely than others to receive coverage in the mainstream news media particularly those cases involving conflict or controversy  which resonate with established definitions of  newsworthiness   this article empirically examines bias in the news media s coverage of social movement litigation through a case study of the lgbt movement  which compares the content of the litigation dockets of three major lgbt civil rights organizations to the content of newspaper coverage of those organizations from 1996 2006  the time period examined in this study offers a unique opportunity to investigate bias in media coverage of movement litigation  this period marks the formative first decade after lgbt rights organizations began to take part in litigation for marriage equality  an issue which has since become an essential part of the lgbt movement s public narrative  as movement litigators during these years tentatively asserted the right for same sex couples to marry in a few select state courts  they were met with an intense conservative backlash targeting both same sex marriage as a goal and the impact litigation strategies being used to achieve it  in examining lgbt movement litigation during this period of intense controversy around same  sex marriage  this article illuminates the role of countermovements in shaping media constructions and broader popular interpretations of social movement litigation  findings from the study reveal that the news media reported more extensively on the lgbt movement s marriage equality litigation than on any other issue  this coverage was drastically disproportionate to the small percentage of marriage equality cases on the lgbt legal organizations  dockets during this time period  in addition  news articles on same sex marriage litigation were significantly more likely than other articles to discuss anti lgbt countermovement activity  these findings suggest that countermovement mobilization against same sex marriage  dubbed a  culture war  in the media  may have created conflict that reporters found particularly newsworthy leading the news media to focus attention on one of the lgbt movement s most contentious litigation campaigns  i explore the implications of these findings in shaping the course of social movement mobilization  countermobilization  and the possibilities for social change

 mental health symptoms predict competency to stand trial and competency restoration success purposealthough several studies have examined demographic and clinical variables associated with findings of incompetency to stand trial  ist   few studies have examined factors influencing competency restoration success  this study is among the first to longitudinally examine demographic variables and mental health symptoms  impact on both ist and competency non restoration  this study fills a gap in the competency to stand trial literature by utilizing the same defendants to examine progression through initial competency decisions to their eventual restoration outcomes  methodsthis study examined demographic variables and mental health symptoms differentiating defendants deemed competent to stand trial  not competent and restored  and not competent and not restored  we coded and analysed 237 competency evaluations consecutively conducted over a 3 year period  resultsspecific psychotic  e g   thought derailment  delusions  auditory visual hallucinations  and neuropsychological symptoms  e g   impaired executive functioning  impaired mental status  were independently associated with findings of ist and non restoration  additional analyses revealed an intellectual disability diagnosis and a greater number of psychotic and manic symptoms predicted a decreased likelihood of competency restoration  conclusionsthese findings suggest more severe symptom combinations  e g   psychotic and manic symptoms  are predictors of both initial findings of incompetency and non restorability  
 metamorphosis in hans kelsen s legal philosophy two major questions stem from the fundamental shift in hans kelsen s legal philosophy that takes place in 1960 and the years thereafter  first  the scope of the shift and  second  its explanation  on the first question  i argue that the shift is not limited to kelsen s rejection of the applicability of logic to legal norms  rather  it reaches to his rejection of the entire kantian edifice of his earlier work  on the second question  i argue that the explanation for the shift has a conceptual dimension as well as a historico biographical dimension  that is  i argue that kelsen s rejection of the principle of non contradiction vis a vis legal norms reaches to the kantian edifice in that the principle was presupposed in kelsen s earlier work and appears  expressis verbis  in his kantian filter   and i argue that certain historico biographical data are germane  including  quite possibly  the earlier revolution in kelsen s thought  that of 1939 40  
 michel foucault and the competing alethurgies of law law has an epistemic dimension  contributing to the social construction of reality  legal trials stage the constitution of knowledge  facts and other kinds of truth in accordance with specified rules of procedure and evidence  as legal cultures differ in their conceptions of fairness  of justice  and especially of the nature and depth of the truth envisaged at trial  there is a demand for analytical means that can contribute to a sophisticated comparison of legal procedures of truth production  some new categories can be found in lectures published in part very recently by michel foucault  whose genealogical sketches of juridical forms of truth making have not received the attention they deserve  foucault distinguishes between three basic forms of legal truth constitution  the test  the inquiry and the examination  as all of these practices are performed in a ritual  liturgical manner  foucault refers to them as  alethurgies   the critical reconstruction of his foray into the historical stages and transformations of legal truth manifestation not only enables a reassessment of foucault s legal thinking  but  more importantly  provides us with categorical devices that might be useful for the comparison of contemporary legal  especially procedural cultures

 minimizing the risk of fraudulent transfer avoidance  a good faith solvency opinion as the shield to protect a leveraged transaction avoidance of leveraged transactions as fraudulent transfers has proliferated in the aftermath of the recent financial crisis and during the resultant economic recession  when planning leveraged deals  such as buyouts  spinoffs  and intercorporate guarantees  corporate boards rely on solvency opinions prepared by outside financial advisors  if a leveraged transaction is challenged in court by a shareholder  the business judgment rule provides a highly deferential standard of judicial review of corporate decisions  as long the decision was well informed and not tainted by fraud  illegality  or self interest  if that same transaction is subject to fraudulent transfer avoidance  however  courts routinely employ a probing analysis  informed by 20 20  hindsight and according no deference to directorial decision making  highlighting that irreconcilable discrepancy in the standards of judicial review  this article argues that  under the current legal regime  the most reasonable solution from a transaction planning perspective is to structure the leveraged deal in reliance on a good faith solvency opinion procured from an independent expert  this article reviews examples of post financial crisis avoidance actions  identifies the most frequently recurring legal criticisms of solvency opinions  and provides tips for ensuring that a solvency opinion obtained contemporaneously with a transaction will minimize risk of avoidance in the future  
 minority mens rea  racial bias and criminal mental states the american criminal justice system relies upon jurors to regularly decode the mental states of criminal defendants  these determinations are often of black and hispanic defendants  making  minority mens rea  a centerpiece of the justice process  this article presents an empirical investigation of how jury eligible subjects decode minority mens rea  in a study involving over 1200 subjects  the article explores whether subjects assign fictional protagonists named jamal and lakisha more culpable mental states than they assign to protagonists named john and emily  the results show that  at least on this particular experimental task  racial bias does not affect the assessment of minority mens rea  an implication is that some decisionmaking contexts and tasks may dampen the effects of racial biases  the article thus argues that we should continue to examine distinct legal decisionmaking tasks in order to better understand how biases do  and do not  affect outcomes in the criminal justice system  
 misconceiving  seasons  in global food systems  the case of the eu seasonal workers directive this article discusses the eu seasonal workers directive alongside case study data of seasonal agricultural work in spain  the conceptual contribution is to critically consider seasonality  and the related assumptions around temporary labour migration for agricultural work  this consideration informs an analysis of the directive s policy approach alongside its three global objectives  it is argued that this directive is likely to fail to meet all three of these objectives  the assumed timeframe for labour demands does not correspond with unmet seasonal challenges  the lack of options for undocumented workers already in the eu may compound their marginalisation  the policy approach of circular migration and limited worker protections does not do enough to prevent new seasonal workers from falling into situations of vulnerability and undocumented status  
 mismanagement of nigeria s oil revenues  is the nigeria sovereign investment authority the panacea  although nigeria is blessed with abundant reserves of oil and gas  nigeria has persistently suffered economic hardship as a result of the gross mismanagement of her oil revenues  in an attempt to reverse this trend  the government of nigeria established a sovereign wealth fund  the nigeria sovereign investment authority  nsia   in 2011  the nsia has three objectives  saving of excess revenues accruing from oil exploitation  fiscal stabilization in times of economic stress and development of social infrastructure  this article assesses the nsia on the basis of some of the core revenue management principles espoused by the santiago principles  in particular  the article analyses the policy objectives of the nsia  the governance structure of the nsia including its operational management  the investment policies and guidelines of the nsia  and the transparency and accountability of the nsia  the overarching aim of the article is to determine the extent to which the constitutive statute of the nsia promotes the prudent management and investment of oil revenues in nigeria

 mock juror evaluations of traditional and ratings based eyewitness identification evidence compared to categorical identifications  culprit likelihood ratings  having the witness rate  for each lineup member  the likelihood that the individual is the culprit  provide a promising alternative for assessing a suspect s likely guilt  four experiments addressed 2 broad questions about the use of culprit likelihood ratings evidence by mock jurors  first  are mock jurors receptive to noncategorical forms of identification evidence  second  does the additional information provided by ratings  relating to discrimination  affect jurors  evaluations of the identification evidence  experiments 1 and 1a manipulated confidence  90  vs  50   and discrimination  good  poor  no information  between participants  evaluations were influenced by confidence  but not discrimination  however  a within participant manipulation of discrimination  experiment 2  demonstrated that evidence of good discrimination enhanced the persuasiveness of moderate levels of confidence  while poor discrimination reduced the persuasiveness of high levels of confidence  thus  participants can interpret ratings based evidence  but may not intuit the discrimination information when evaluating ratings for a single identification procedure  providing detailed instructions about interpreting ratings produced clear discrimination effects when evaluating a single identification procedure  experiment 3   across 4 experiments  we found no evidence that mock jurors perceived noncategorical identification evidence to be less informative than categorical evidence  however  jurors will likely benefit from instruction when interpreting ratings provided by a single witness  
 moral disengagement in legal judgments we investigated the role of moral disengagement in a legally relevant judgment in this theoretically driven empirical analysis  moral disengagement is a social cognitive phenomenon through which people reason their way toward harming others  presenting a useful framework for investigating legal judgments that often result in harming individuals for the good of society  we tested the role of moral disengagement in forensic psychologists  willingness to conduct the most ethically questionable clinical task in the criminal justice system  competence for execution evaluations  our hypothesis that moral disengagement would function as mediator of participants  existing attitudes and their judgmentsa theoretical bridge between attitudes and judgmentswas robustly supported  moral disengagement was key to understanding how psychologists decide to engage in competence for execution evaluations  we describe in detail the moral disengagement measure we used  including exploratory and confirmatory factor analyses across two separate samples  the four factor measure accounted for a total of 52 18 percent of the variance in the sample of forensic psychologists  and the model adequately fit the data in the entirely different sample of jurors in a confirmatory factor analysis  despite the psychometric strengths of this moral disengagement measure  we describe the pros and cons of existing measures of moral disengagement  we outline future directions for moral disengagement research  especially in legal contexts  
 moral foundations  intuitions of justice  and the intricacies of punitive sentiment research on punitive attitudes has  so far  focused largely on people s retributive attitudes toward offenders  however  a large theoretical body of research indicates that concerns about different types of offenses and victims may be just as important in structuring punitive attitudes  particularly  moral foundations theory suggests that distinct punitive attitudes may be based in intuitive moral concerns   moral foundations   about offenses that victimize individuals  groups  and the  divine   referring to bodily purity or sanctity  in this study  i develop measures of what i term  victim centered punitiveness   and use data from a nationwide survey of adult americans  n   915  to compare the sources of offender  and victim centered punitiveness  as expected  different moral foundations shape offender and victim centered punitiveness in different ways  suggesting that they have distinct intuitive  moral bases  other factors  including racial resentment  also have distinct effects on each type of punitiveness  
 more than misfortune  recognizing natural disasters as a concern for transitional justice natural disasters are often characterized by gross human rights violations  yet these injustices are rarely acknowledged and addressed through transitional justice processes  do systematic abuses in disaster contexts fall within the scope of transitional justice  in exploring this question  this article draws attention to a facet of injustice that has been ignored  arbitrarily discounted or inadvertently effaced  i suggest that misperceptions about natural disasters as inevitable  blameless misfortunes perpetuate neglect  in theory and in practice  of injustices associated with natural disasters  and draw on insights from the disaster studies literature to challenge this exclusion  engaging concrete examples of recent disasters to ground my theoretical claims  i contend that egregious  systematic abuses associated with natural disasters may represent significant concerns for transitional justice  
 nash bargaining solutions for international climate agreements under different sets of bargaining weights bargaining is a tool to share collaborative gains and to facilitate reaching agreement  to improve incentives to join an international climate agreement  ica   the nash bargaining solution can be used to distribute cooperative gains across signatories  in this paper  we examine how the formation of icas and their mitigation efficiency are impacted by the use of the nash bargaining solution  in a nash bargaining game with heterogeneous players  bargaining powers are unequal and may be driven by different characteristics of the players  we employ different sets of asymmetric bargaining weights in order to examine the effectiveness of climate coalitions that emerge as stable agreements  using the nash bargaining solution  we obtain results from the stability of coalition model  staco   we find that the nash bargaining solution can improve the participation incentives and performances of icas as compared to agreements that do not redistribute gains from cooperation  but its capacity to overcome free riding incentives is limited  however  if nash bargaining accounts for outside options of players  we find larger stable coalitions and higher global abatement levels  in fact  nash bargaining with outside options can stabilise the largest coalitions that can possibly be stable in our game  
 nasty weather and ugly produce  climate change  agricultural adaptation  and food waste food systems worldwide are threatened by climate change  as reflected  for example  in the diminished yields of fruits and vegetables and reduced production of global fisheries  this article discusses the threats of climate change on agricultural production and the need for agricultural adaptation  it posits that food insecurity must be considered in terms of climate change and its likely effects on food production  the article argues that agricultural mitigation and adaptation measures should must be pursued and communicated through the mechanisms of the paris agreement  in the united states  reducing food waste effectuated by the regulation on the culling of unattractive but edible produce represents a modest  yet necessary mitigation and adaptation opportunity  
 national constitutional courts in supranational litigation  a contextual analysis the article examines the role of national constitutional courts in supranational litigation  it firstly illustrates their value and situates well known judicial doctrines affecting their jurisdiction in the context of the normative claims  policy agenda and institutional framework promoted by the european union  against this background  it gauges the potential of national constitutional courts in countering the process of intergovernmental and technocratic encroachment of national constitutional democracies characterising the most recent evolutionary stages of the european integration process  it is claimed that constitutional courts are in the position of reinforcing  resisting or correcting union measures with a detrimental impact on national constitutional principles  after having identified in correction the approach more coherent with their constitutional mandate  the article highlights a disturbing paradox  in remaining faithful to their constitutional role  constitutional courts contribute to the sustainability of a comprehensive institutional setting corroding the idea of constitutional democracy on which they are premised  
 nationwide injunctions against the federal government  a structural approach when a court invalidates a federal government policy  it must then decide the scope of the remedy  a common remedy is an injunction a judicial order prohibiting enforcement of the policy  traditionally  lower federal courts enjoined the government only from enforcing the invalidated policy against the victorious plaintiff  leaving it in place against other members of the public  a nationwide injunction  however  forbids the government from enforcing the policy against anyone in the country  effectively taking the policy out of circulation  this note argues that nationwide injunctions contravene three core structural principles of the federal courts   1  the regional design of the courts of appeals without intercircuit stare decisis   2  the supreme court s holding in united states v  mendoza that the federal government is not subject to non mutual issue preclusion  and  3  the doctrine of intercircuit nonacquiescence  it concludes that nationwide injunctions against the federal government should be disfavored and that such injunctions should not extend beyond the circuit of the enjoining court  simply put  lower federal courts should not make nationwide law  
 naval mines  legal considerations in armed conflict and peacetime the purpose of this article is to examine the key elements of the legal framework in which naval mines are used both across the spectrum of conflict and during peacetime  the article will also consider the legal issues associated with the use of mines by states in international armed conflict  and address the distinct legal issues which arise in non international armed conflict  where the emergence of an increasing presence of non state armed groups has been a hallmark of the late twentieth and early twenty first centuries  the obligations placed upon states in peacetime  and under the law of neutrality  when the use and presence of naval mines is a relevant factor will also be analyzed  
 neither fish  nor fowl  honeybees and the parameters of current legal frameworks for animals  wildlife and biodiversity the regulation of animals falls into three main paradigms  animal health  animal welfare and conservation  this article argues that in the modern context there are several regulatory challenges which are not accommodated within those parameters including those presented by contemporary issues such as animal diseases and hybrid and feral animals  a case study of honeybees is used to explore these frameworks and their parameters and limitations in detail  the difficulties arising are not confined to idiosyncratic cases such as honeybees however  but also apply at a broader level  while some of these difficulties might be tackled through incremental changes to existing legislation  a more holistic framework which moves beyond historical assumptions about the nature of animals and their relationship with people therefore  will ultimately be needed  
 neoliberal penality and state legitimacy  politics of amnesty in turkey during the akp period general amnesty is an extraordinary policy mostly used in the aftermath of civil wars or regime transition to maintain political stability  in turkey  however  amnesties have historically been used to resolve the chronic problems of the criminal justice system  this radically changed after the justice and development party  akp  came to power in 2002  which has taken a sharp anti amnesty position  this shift should be understood as part of akp s neoliberal orientation in criminal justice policies that has increased the dose of punitiveness  emphasized individual responsibility of offenders  and enhanced the organizational efficiency of institutions  central to this neoliberal penal orientation is the party s neopopulist ideology constructed on an image of a strong state that  i  is capable of dealing with structural problems without having to recourse to extraordinary measures   ii  no longer sees criminals as victims of fate   iii  prioritizes victims  rights  our analysis contributes to the mounting literature on neoliberal penalty in two ways  first is by bringing the question of why states forgive at center stage when most work focuses exclusively on how and why states punish  second is by paying closer attention to how developing country governments with limited financial  logistical  and administrative resources manage the tensions and contradictions that neoliberal penal policies bring forth  our arguments are based on official reports  in depth interviews with legal professionals  and descriptive statistics on the criminal justice system  
 networking in the shadow of the law  informal access to legal expertise through personal network ties civil legal problems are common in everyday life  but the costs of obtaining legal representation create barriers to legal action and contribute to disparities in access to justice  some individuals  however  may have informal access to legal assistance through personal network ties with lawyers  enhancing their responses to justiciable problems  in this study  we draw from theories of social capital and network formation to examine the distribution and mobilization of network based legal expertise  using nationally representative survey data  we find that network based access to lawyers is widespread  and most people who have ties to lawyers expect to informally mobilize legal assistance when facing a problem  but people who are most likely to afford formal legal representation are also most likely to have informal access to lawyers  thus  while informal access to lawyers may shape responses to legal problems  it may also exacerbate inequalities in experiences with civil justice events  
 neuroticism in child sex offenders and its association with sexual dysfunctions  cognitive distortions  and psychological complaints studies in child sex offenders  cso  often report deviant personality characteristics  in our study  we investigated neuroticism in cso and tested the hypothesis that cso with high neuroticism show more serious abuse behavior and are more likely to exhibit sexual dysfunction and cognitive distortions  as compared to cso with low neuroticism  a sample of 40 cso  both child sexual abusers and child sexual material users  was split into two subsamples based on their neuroticism scores  obtained by the neo personality inventory revised  neo pi r  questionnaire  subsequently  we compared their scores in the multiphasic sex inventory  msi  questionnaire and symptom checklist 90 revised  scl 90 r   our results show that cso exhibited higher levels of neuroticism than controls  but were still in the normal range  in cso  neuroticism was associated with sexual dysfunction and cognitive distortions  rather than with more severe abuse behavior  moreover  neuroticism in this group was linked to a broad range of psychological problems and psychopathological symptoms  such as somatization or anxiety  our findings suggest that neuroticism even below the level of personality disorder is associated with a broader range of psychological problems in cso  which should be addressed in therapy   c  2017 elsevier ltd  all rights reserved  
 new human rights concept for old african problems  an analysis of the challenges of introducing and implementing indigenous rights in africa the adoption by some peoples in africa of the indigenous rights concept has brought about new challenges regarding the application of the concept to these peoples  the indigenous rights concept was shaped by the colonial experiences of indigenous peoples in the americas and australasia  the international understanding of the concept pre supposes the existence of a set of group rights belonging to peoples who are descendants of the earlier inhabitants of the territory on which a state is located  in contrast to other citizens of that state who are considered colonial settlers  the african commission on human and peoples  rights has attempted to overcome this challenge by evolving a description of indigenousness for africa  this article argues that  although the conceptual challenges that flow from the foreign origin of the concept have not been fully overcome  the african commission s description has successfully located africa within the global indigenous rights framework

 no judicial brexit of the german federal constitutional court the judgment of the german federal constitutional court on the legality of the omt decision of the european central bank was eagerly awaited  on the one hand  the federal constitutional court let the decision of the european central bank pass through the standards of the german basic law  on the other hand  it developed a modified position in co operation with the cjeu and created new kinds of protection obligations from the right to a democratic participation of the citizen  these protection obligations justify a responsibility for integration of the german state bodies accompanied by the european integration process  all in all the position of the federal constitutional court in its omt judgment is more open to integration than in the lisbon judgment  the obligation of the federal constitutional court to make a reference to the cjeu is underlined  by this the federal constitutional court is fully integrated in the european legal system and a judicial brexit was prevented  
 no minor matter  underage soldiers  parents  and the nationalization of habeas corpus in civil war america in 1901  major william birkhimer  one of the nation s foremost experts on military law  reflected on how radically the authority of the united states army had grown over the course of the nineteenth century  during the nation s early years  the public s fear and distrust of standing armies had prevented the establishment of a large national force  with americans preferring to rely instead on local and state militias  pervasive suspicion of concentrated military power  combined with a federalist system that granted individual states significant autonomy  left the united states regulars vulnerable to interference of a sort that professional military men deplored  to illustrate this sorry state of affairs  birkhimer described how recruiting officers who unwittingly enlisted minorsthough they had every reason  including the recruit s declaration  to deem them of legal agefound themselves ruthlessly prosecuted  and condemned by courts without apparent rhyme or reason  meanwhile  the hopeless federal government  unable to respond effectively to judicial challenges by the states  left its faithful officers hanging out to dry

 notes on the international court of justice  part 6  the fourth use of travaux preparatoires in the lagrand case  to prove the non preclusion of an interpretation under the customary international law on the interpretation of treaties as reflected in articles 31 32 of the vienna convention on the law of treaties  the travaux preparatoires of a treaty may be resorted to in order to confirm the meaning resulting from the application of the general rule in article 31  to remove an ambiguity  or to cure a manifestly absurd or unreasonable result  the international court of justice divined a fourth use of travaux preparatoires to prove the non preclusion of an interpretation in the lagrand case  this use provides some additional comfort to the interpreter of a treaty provision that the interpretation reached through an exercise under article 31 is not negatively affected by the travaux or is not definitely wrong  this use has also been extended by the court to the use of context as well as text in treaty interpretation  
 notice and takedown  online service provider and rightsholder accounts of everyday practice section 512 of the digital millennium copyright act established both  safe harbors  from liability for online service providers and the well known  no tice and takedown  process for removing online infringements of copyrighted material  in the ensuing two decades  the notice and takedown process has become a primary tool for raising and resolving copyright disputes in the united states  but despite its influence  there is little empirical research describing 512 s operation or its effectiveness  this article digests findings from a qualitative study  reported fully in the three study report  notice and takedown in everyday practice 1 that helps fill this gap  through detailed surveys and interviews with nearly three dozen respondents  we provide the first detailed account of how 512 is implemented and experienced by online service providers and large rightsholders  all respondents agreed that the 512 safe harbors and the ability to take down infringing material remain fundamental  but the online copyright enforcement ecosystem is also highly diverse  and all participants face challenges  the findings suggest that the notice and takedown system is important  under strain  and that there is no  one size fits all  approach to improving it  based on the findings  we suggest a variety of best practices and limited legal reforms

 obstruction of justice in the effort to eradicate corruption in indonesia corruption is a reality in indonesia and has a significant destructive force  not only does it harm the wealth of the state  but it also takes away the legitimacy of law enforcement by destroying the public s trust in law  this can lead to the destruction of democracy and modernization in indonesia  aware of the situation  or perhaps for political correctness  the post independence governments made the war on corruption a state of emergency  but it was not until the advent of the political era known to the indonesians as era reformasi in 2000 that the fight against corruption intensified with the enactment of law no  30 2002 creating the corruption eradication commission or komisi pemberantasan korupsi  hereafter referred to as kpk   since its creation  the commission has been hunting down corruptors like never before  but going after corrupt officials is not an easy task  as kpk gets tougher due to more legal backup and public s trust  corruptors find illegal ways to bend  or impede the law in order to get away with their heinous crime  this practice is known as obstruction of justice  this paper discusses the issue of obstruction of justice in the effort to eradicate corruption in indonesia  it sets out to answer the following questions  what does obstruction of justice in the corruption eradication effort look like in indonesia  and how can law enforcement agencies best deal with it  drawing on empirical data  the study reveals that an act is deemed obstructing justice if it is done intentionally to prevent the legal process from running smoothly  mens rea   although anyone is susceptible of committing an act of obstruction of justice  it is usually accomplished with the support of affluent people such as government and law enforcement officials  lawyers  and law makers  the study suggests that revising laws on corruption  continuing collaboration between law enforcement agencies  making use of the existing corruption  related laws  increasing law enforcement professionalism  and raising public awareness need to be embraced as future approaches to heighten the ongoing war on corruption   c  2017 elsevier ltd  all rights reserved  
 odd man out  a comparative critique of the federal arbitration act s article iii shortcomings arbitration is an issue of considerable national concern  yet as the supreme court continues to broaden the federal arbitration act s  faa   liberal federal policy favoring arbitration agreements   few viable challenges to the faa s expansion remain  one would be hard pressed to find a doctrinal framework so permissive of delegating judicial power to non article iii tribunals  meanwhile  the justices responsible for the faa s modern metastasis continue to vociferously question other congressional delegations of judicial power to non article iii bodies  those same justices have yet to address the potential article iii shortcomings of the court s faa jurisprudence  this note investigates that analytical incoherence  
 of handcuffs and signals  investment treaties and capital flows to developing countries this article examines the potential association of investment treaties with the quantity and cost of capital flows to developing countries  whereas previous research on the effect of bilateral investment treaties  bit  on capital flows has focused almost exclusively on direct foreign investment  dfi   this article examines total flows of all types  it also asks a question ignored by previous studies  do investment treaties affect the cost that a developing country must pay for the capital it receives  instead of viewing investment treaties as just international legal instruments prescribing rights and duties  the article also examines their role as information to international capital markets  relying on insights from the economics of information and signaling theory  it argues that investment treaties influence capital flows through the signals they send to international capital markets  accordingly  it creates a model of a  strong bit signal country  and proceeds to identify twenty six countries that fit the model  while identifying for comparative purposes fifteen countries deemed to be  weak signal bit countries   an analysis of capital flows to both groups of countries finds that the strong signal bit countries experienced significant increased capital inflows following the completion of their bit negotiation program and also reveals that they outperformed the weak signal bit countries in this respect  using data on sovereign credit ratings and world bank governance indicators on the rule of law  the author also finds that several countries experienced an improvement in both indicators following the conclusion of their bit programs  leading to the inference that such improvement might also be associated with a reduction in a country s risk premium and therefore a decline in its cost of capital  
 of spies  saboteurs  and enemy accomplices  history s lessons for the constitutionality of wartime military tribunals congress has recently authorized military commissions to try enemies not only for violations of the international law of war  but also for domestic law offenses  such as providing material support to terrorism and conspiring to commit law of war offenses  moreover  president trump has indicated support for further military trials  including trials against u s  citizens  such military tribunals lack the civilian jury and independent judge that article iii of the constitution prescribes  the constitutionality of such an abrogation of article iii s criminal trial guarantees has been debated during many of the nation s wars without clear resolution  and the constitutional question is now at the heart of a potentially landmark case  al bahlul v  united states  currently before the supreme court  in the rare cases where the supreme court has recognized exceptions to article iii s criminal trial protections  it has typically invoked functional and normative justifications  when it comes to adjudication of war related domestic law offenses  however  neither the government nor the appellate judges who have defended commission trials have offered any such functional or normative considerations sufficient to justify denial of the independent judge and jury that article iii guarantees  defenders of the military tribunals have instead relied almost exclusively upon historical claims of two kinds to defend the constitutionality of using military commissions in this context  this article addresses one of those historical claims namely  that the constitution should be understood to have preserved  rather than to have modified  the federal government s power to prosecute a war as it did during the revolutionary war  according to this argument  the constitution was ratified against  and should be presumed not to have called into question  a practice of military adjudication of offenses that were not violations of the international law of war  court martial proceedings  authorized by the second continental congress and approved by general george washington  against certain spies and against disloyal civilians who aided the british  the earliest congresses purportedly confirmed this constitutional understanding by enacting statutes permitting military trials for spying and for aiding the enemy statutes that have remained in the federal code ever since  this article offers the first comprehensive account of the revolutionary war precedents  it discusses how they were understood in the ensuin g decades and the ways in which they  and the post 1789 statutes  have been invoked and mischaracterized as authority in later wars  this history demonstrates that the received wisdom about these precedents is almost entirely mistaken  and that they provide little  if any  support for a new article iii exception for military adjudication of war related domestic law offenses  the article thus offers an object lesson in how a complex history can be misunderstood and distorted in the course of constitutional interpretation  particularly on questions of war powers  the pre constitutional history does  however  include one conspicuous aberration  a 1778 congressional resolution authorizing trial by court martial of civilians who provided a particular kind of aid to the british army  general washington relied upon this resolution in 1780 as authority to convene a court martial to try joshua hett smith for assisting benedict arnold in the plot to surrender west point to the british  this article shows why it would be a mistake to accord much interpretive weight to the smith case a striking deviation from washington s otherwise consistent conduct in crafting exceptions to article iii s criminal trial guarantees  
 offences against the administration of justice at the international criminal court although the international criminal court  icc  was established to prosecute the most serious crimes of concern to the international community  around a quarter of all indictments it has issued have instead been for offences against the administration of justice  covered under article 70 of the icc statute  most of these offences have related to witness interference  typically involving bribery  while rules addressing offences against the administration of justice or contempt of court are also a feature of other international criminal tribunals  and have given rise to a number of high profile cases  the situation at the icc can be distinguished  both in terms of the scale and gravity of offences and because the icc s relevant provisions are considerably more difficult to amend in response to challenges  this article critically examines some of these key challenges posed by article 70 proceedings  and considers their impact on the court s functioning  
 offenders with substance abuse who receive mandatory psychiatric treatment we examined the mandatory treatment referral rates before and after taiwan s penal code revision of 2006 and factors associated with the mandatory treatment in taiwan of criminals who engage in substance abuse  the 3 467 offenders who underwent forensic psychiatric assessments  based on taiwan s court sentence dataset  included 3 163 offenders with substance abuse related crimes  but only 412  13   received mandatory treatment  there were no changes in mandatory treatment referral rates before and after the revision  the three main factors that determined whether an offender received mandatory psychiatric treatment were an agreement by the forensic psychiatrist and the presiding judge attesting to the lack of legal responsibility during the commission of the offense  the presence of substance  related psychosis  and location of the court in a rural area  
 offensive searches  toward a two tier theory of fourth amendment protection this article examines the newly minted  trespass  test in fourth amendment law  which holds that police conduct qualifies as a search and triggers constitutional scrutiny when it involves  physical intrusion  onto a  constitutionally protected area   the trespass test portends a possible sea change  offering a new baseline of protection against searches that do not fit neatly within the familiar  reasonable expectations of privacy  framework of fourth amendment harm  going forward  fourth amendment law will have two tiers  a first tier that asks whether government agents have searched by physically intruding on a constitutionally protected area  and a second tier that asks whether government agents have searched by impinging on a person s  reasonable expectations of privacy   among scholars  there is a nascent but growing consensus that  intrusions  under the trespass test refer to violations of positive law  we disagree  instead  we argue that the test is concerned with government action that would be highly offensive or degrading to a reasonable person  not only does this construction better comport with the court s reasoning in  trespass search  cases  it also brings into focus blurry corners of fourth amendment law that are hard to justify on privacy grounds but easily explained as tacit applications of the trespass as  indignity doctrine  the article closes with an examination of dignity s role in fourth amendment law  we contend that dignity is a fundamental fourth amendment value because respect for dignity helps to preserve and strengthen popular sovereignty  dignitary protections safeguard important interests in autonomy  equality  and human flourishing  and they ensure that government agents  in discharging their duties  adhere to norms of civility and respect  bolstering their status as the people s servants and guardians  
 older lesbians  gay men and the  right to die  debate   i always keep a lethal dose of something  because i don t want to become an elderly isolated person  this article considers the right to die  debate from the perspectives of older lesbians and gay men  drawing upon data gathered for a phd in law  my argument is that older lesbians and gay men are multiply disadvantaged  a  by an increased risk of feeling that life is not worth living due to affective inequalities  inadequate informal and formal social support  and  b  by a denial of access to the right to die both under such circumstances and or if they wish to resist the normativities associated with a passive  medicalized death  i argue for the need to distinguish between a wish to die because of deficiencies in the care system and a wish to die in order to control how  when and where one s life ends  my analysis highlights the contextual contingencies of vulnerability  in relation to the right to die and interrogates the heterosexist and disciplinary reproductive normativities underpinning the notions of natural  deaths  
 on hostility and hospitality  othering pierre legranda pierre legrand s return to the pages of the american journal of comparative law after nearly twenty years is cause for reflection on the reasons for this prolific comparatist s absence from one of the discipline s leading scholarly fora  one reason is the widespread disdain aimed at legrand as a result of his persistent  sharply critical  and often pointedly personal crusade against the discipline s accepted approaches and their most prominent practitioners  this is partly the nature of the article he publishes in this collection  which features a no holds bared  uncomplimentary assessment of the work of james gordley  in this article i argue that legrand s exile is a poor response to his sharp tongued but profoundly important vision for our discipline  the better path  one i try to map here  would be to challenge legrand by exposing the ways in which his hostility for comparative law s  established scholars  clashes with the derridian critical theory that animates all of his work  
 on punishment severity and crime rates punishment severity and crime rates vary across jurisdictions  some countries have punitive sanctions and nevertheless experience relatively high crime rates  this article explores potential sources of the interjurisdictional heterogeneity in the optimal law enforcement model  paying particular attention to the possibility that the high crime despite high sanctions outcome can be socially optimal  the key conceptual issue is the interaction between detection efforts of enforcers and avoidance efforts of offenders  
 on the twenty fifth anniversary of lucas  making or breaking the takings claim in lucas v  south carolina coastal council  the united states supreme court established the premier categorical regulatory takings standard with certain limited exceptions  the lucas rule establishes that private property owners are entitled to compensation for a taking under the fifth amendment takings clause when a government regulation  denies all economically beneficial or productive use of land   today  lucas remains the controlling law on categorical regulatory takings  but in application  how much does lucas still matter  in reviewing more than 1 700 cases in state and federal courts  we identified that lucas claims were successful in just 1 6  of the cases  this does not mean lucas is unimportant  however  the small lucas claim success rate suggests the importance of being strategic in pleading takings claims  the problem of defining the denominator in the regulatory takings equation is essential to understand for litigants pursuing the lucas categorical regulatory takings analysis  based upon our research  we argue that lucas s holding incentivizes the private contractual agreements entered into by property owners to shrink the takings denominator and tilt the scales slightly in favor of the plaintiff  the ability of a property owner to reduce the denominator remains the loadstar for a lucas case winning strategy  this is important for not only theorists but also for practitioners to know as they litigate and conduct transactions in lucas s shadow  
 on the unexpected use of unenforceable contract terms  evidence from the residential rental market this article explores the prevalence of unenforceable and misleading terms in residential rental contracts  for this purpose  the study analyzes a sample of seventy residential leases from the greater boston area in terms of massachusetts landlord and tenant law  the article s findings reveal that landlords often use deceptive as well as clearly invalid provisions in their contracts  and regularly fail to disclose the vast majority of the mandatory rights and remedies that the law bestows upon tenants in their leases  building on psychological insights and on survey evidence  the article suggests that this drafting pattern may significantly affect tenants  decisions and behavior  in particular  whena problem or a dispute with the landlord arises  tenants are likely to perceive the terms in their lease agreements as enforceable and binding  and consequently forgo valid legal rights and claims  therefore  the article expects that such clauses will persist as long as monitoring and enforcement mechanisms do not sufficiently deter landlords from using such terms in their contracts  in light of this evidence  the article discusses preliminary policy prescriptions

 opposite of correct  inverted insider perceptions of race and bankruptcy previous data collected during the 2007 meltdown of the subprime mortgage market showed that african americans were approximately twice as likely to file chapter 13 bankruptcy than persons of other races  a significant policy issue given the generally less generous rules in chapter 13  we first update and replicate these findings with new data collected during 2013 2014 as the housing market recovered  results of the original study were not specific to the subprime crisis as the new data showed the same 2 1 racial disparity as the older data  suggesting that this disparity may be a relatively enduring part of the u s  bankruptcy system  to see if insiders were aware of this disparity  we sent surveys to a national random sample of consumer bankruptcy attorneys  they seemed to believe there was a racial disparity in bankruptcy  but they had the disparity exactly backwards  a majority  about 60   believed that whites were twice as likely to file chapter 13 when it is actually african americans who are twice as likely to do so  we also report on a convenience sample of respondents from amazon mechanical turk  these respondents have little or no knowledge of the u s  bankruptcy system but likely hold common american stereotypes about which groups tend to be responsible or irresponsible  their responses were largely similar to those of bankruptcy professionals  overall  mechanical turk respondents were slightly more accurate than bankruptcy professionals  the likely reason is that mechanical turk respondents stuck more closely to the national base rate  across studies  it seems that those inside the bankruptcy system have little knowledge of the racial disparities that exist within it  instead  they rely on common american stereotypes about who are responsible or irresponsible citizens  
 optimal remedies for patent infringement this paper derives optimal remedies for patent infringement  examining damages awards and injunctions  the fundamental optimality condition that applies to both awards and injunctions equates the marginal static cost of intellectual property protection with the marginal  dynamic  benefit from the innovation thereby induced  when the social value of the patent is sufficiently high  the optimal award induces socially efficient investment by giving the innovator the entire social value of her investment   c  2017 elsevier inc  all rights reserved  
 order and control in the environment  exploring the effects on undesired behaviour and the importance of locus of control purposethis study aimed at gaining more insight into the combined influence of environmental factors and personal vulnerability to environmental cues on cheating behaviour in a task related indoor setting  we propose that a disorderly environment increases cheating as it implicitly signals that undesirable behaviours are common  camera presence is expected to buffer these effects  we included locus of control  loc  as a personality variable  as we expected individuals with an external loc to be more susceptible by environmental cues  methodsseventy six students participated in a 2  orderly vs  disorderly environment x2  camera vs  no camera present  experiment with cheating as the main dependent variable  we established the individual participant s loc  rotter  1966  psychol  monogr   80  1  in a separate session  resultsfindings did indeed show that individuals with an external loc cheated more in a disorderly rather than an orderly environment  we also found an interaction effect with loc suggesting this effect was particularly present for participants having an external rather than internal loc  camera presence did not yield significant main or interaction effects  conclusionthese findings confirm the importance of environmental design for behaviour regulation as well as the moderating influence of personality makeup  
 originalism without text originalism is not about the text  though the theory is often treated as a way to read the constitution s words  that conventional view is misleading  a society can be recognizably originalist without any words to interpret  without a written constitution  written statutes  or any writing at all  if texts aren t fundamental to originalism  then originalism isn t fundamentally about texts  avoiding that error helps us see what originalism generally is about  namely  our present constitutional law  and its dependence on a crucial moment in the past  
 originalist methodology this essay sketches an originalist methodology using ideas from legal theory and theoretical linguistics  including the distinctions between interpretation and construction and between semantics and pragmatics  the essay aims to dispel a number of misconceptions about the methods used by originalists  among these is the notion that originalists rely on dictionary definitions to determine the communicative content of the constitutional text  although dictionaries may play some role  the better approach emphasizes primary evidence such as that provided by corpus linguistics  another misconception is that originalists do not consider context  to the contrary  the investigation of context plays a central role in originalist methodology  part i of this essay articulates a theoretical framework that draws on ideas from contemporary legal theory and linguistics  part ii investigates methods for determining the constitutional text s semantic content  part iii turns to methods for investigating the role of context in disambiguating and enriching what would otherwise be sparse semantic meaning  part iv describes an originalist approach to constitutional construction  the essay concludes with a short reflection on the future of originalist methodology  
 out of focus  zooming in on body cameras  privacy  and medical emergencies as the use of body worn cameras by police and law enforcement agencies becomes more widespread in the united states  local and state governments are beginning to grapple with how to regulate their use  this regulation requires local and state governments to consider a number of factors  not the least of which are the privacy concerns involved in deciding when police ought to record civilian encounters  in 2014  the california legislature began to consider a bill that  among other things  attempted to address such privacy concerns by barring officers from recording while responding to medical emergencies in public  though that bill ultimately died in committee  other states are beginning to think seriously about how best to regulate body worn camera usage  this note will explore the privacy concerns involved in recording medical emergencies in public and will argue against such a prohibition  instead  this note will ultimately argue that body camera policies should be tailored to meet the concerns and exigencies of each locale  and that  therefore  state should not over regulate body camera use  moreover  this note will argue that such prohibitions are wholly duplicative  as such privacy concerns  to the extent that they exist  are generally mitigated by state and federal sunshine law exceptions  
 out of many  one  strasbourg s ibrahim decision on article 6 this case comment considers the european court of human rights decision of ibrahim v united kingdom on 13 september 2016  relying on salduz v turkey  the applicants claimed  largely unsuccessfully  that denial of access to a lawyer during police questioning  and subsequent admission into evidence of statements made in the course of that questioning  violated fair trial rights protected by article 6 of the european convention on human rights  the comment suggests that the decision s unusually emphatic statements about article 6 s internal structure  have consequences for assessing violations in future applications  further  the decision creates greater room for public interest balancing in article 6 cases  the decision may thus undermine the article 6 guarantees  
 out of the institution  into the classroom  legal challenges to the use of restraint and seclusion in school settings in the united states the issue of restraint and seclusion of children with mental and developmental disabilities in schools has gained greater attention in the united states in recent years as more children with disabilities are attending mainstream schools  this article looks at how cases brought on behalf of children who have been subjected to such treatment fit or fail to fit within a well developed jurisprudence that provides constitutional protections for the rights of people with mental disabilities to be free from discrimination and from cruel and unusual punishment it examines this jurisprudence in light of article 16 s emphasis on the provision of age  and gender appropriate services to protect people with disabilities from exploitation  violence  and abuse   c  2017 elsevier ltd  all rights reserved  
 overseeing criminal justice  the supervisory role of the public prosecution service in china the chinese public prosecution service  the procuracy  is modelled on the soviet union system and has been accorded the controversial function of supervising other legal institutions in the criminal justice system  drawing upon my own empirical data on the prosecution of crime in china  this article critically examines the way the power of supervision operates from an internal perspective  it argues that the power of supervision has been used as an institutional asset to secure the interests of the procuracy by analysing its oversight of police investigations and court decisions  the way prosecutors perceive themselves  and the efficacy of the supervision in a comparative context  the current status of the procuracy dictates that it is unable to undertake the role of supervision to safeguard the criminal process  
 pan european personal data breaches  mapping of current practices and recommendations to facilitate cooperation among data protection authorities the emergence of frequent personal data breaches of a cross border and even pan european dimension coupled with the current lack of harmonized and systematic approaches to tackle them have motivated the need for further research leading to possible improvement of those cooperation challenges  in this respect  we report here on the organization  execution and analysis of the 1st pan european personal data breaches exercise that was conducted at the end of 2015 by the directorate general joint research centre in collaboration with the directorate general for justice and consumers of the european commission and the data protection authorities of seven eu member states  this cyber exercise aimed at promoting and improving collaboration between member states when cross border incidents of personal data breaches occur  by serving as training exercise  mapping existing procedures and by helping identify best practices to handle such incidents  this scientific initiative constitutes a direct support of the recently adopted general data protection regulation  analysis of results led to some very interesting findings  in particular  communication issues were the ones that were highlighted as the most important ones  there is an evident lack of a global communication list of competent officers from data protection authorities and this hinders cooperation  moreover  there are no established current practices on handling such incidents and accordingly their management is still performed in an ad hoc manner  the outcome of the exercise illustrated the need for putting in place systematic procedures  as well as tools and frameworks to support communication and interaction between all interested stakeholders   c  2017 apostolos malatras  ignacio sanchez  laurent beslay  iwen coisel  ioannis vakalis  giuseppe d acquisto  manuel garcia sanchez  matthieu grail  marit hansen  vasilios zorkadis published by elsevier ltd  
 parallel importation of patented products in thailand  the need for the new patent exhaustion regime in the light of the asean economic community  aec  this article considers the problem of parallel importation of patented products in thailand in the light of the asean economic community  aec   one of the objectives of the aec is to promote the free movement of goods and a single market within the southeast asia region  but  the exhaustion provision in section 36 7  of the thai patent act 1979 makes it difficult for thailand to achieve such an objective because it is unclear whether this provision is applied as national exhaustion or international exhaustion  also  this exhaustion provision can only apply to the petty patent and the patent for invention  but cannot apply to the design patent  so the design patent owner can prevent parallel importation of products embodying the registered design from other asean countries into thailand  in order to achieve the aec objective  this article argues that a regional exhaustion approach like that of the eu is appropriate for thailand  but the wording of the current exhaustion provision does not support the application of a regional exhaustion approach  hence  this article suggests that changes should be made to several provisions in the thai patent act 1979 in order to make them compatible with the regional exhaustion approach  such a change should ensure that the exhaustion provision can be applied to the design patent  also  the proposed change should ensure that if the products are manufactured by the holder of a compulsory licence in another country and imported into thailand without the consent of the patent owner  then the patent owner in thailand should be able to prevent it  the additional legal measure  which provides a means of access to the complaints procedures of the relevant safety authorities in the circumstance where the patented products imported from other asean countries are not safe  should be introduced  also  a change should be made to some border measures provisions in order to allow such provisions to apply where the imported products infringed the patent right in the same manner as they apply in the context of trademark and copyright

 parties  legal capacity in electronic commerce transactions the aim of this article is to scrutinise the uncertainty of the iranian electronic commerce law  iri ecl 2004  provisions especially on the issue of capacity of parties  issues of parties  legal capacity have been resolved in traditional contracts but they are still debatable in electronic commerce transactions  under uk law  contracts formed by minors for things other than necessities are unenforceable against the minor but enforceable against the merchant  seller  while according to us uniform commercial code in online contracts capacity is not recognized as a legal excuse to nullify a contract  at the mean time  contracts made by incapacitate person is considered null under iranian law  in spite of technical developments such as digital signatures and smart cards used in verifying the identity and capacity of parties in electronic commerce transactions  the legal certainty on capacity of parties is still questionable  the article also examines the application of traditional contract general rules on parties  legal capacity in iran to electronic commerce with reference to eu law  the eu law which is already at an advance stage serves a guide for future development of e commerce law in iran  
 partner abuse and its association with emotional distress  a study exploring lgbti relationships this study examines partner abuse in lbgti relationships  with focus on the associations with emotional distress and protective factors  two hundred and eighty seven participants took part  partner abuse  victimisation  comprised three factors  conflict orientated aggression  hostile ignorance and control of communication  and social control and possessiveness  including threats to possessions   perpetration factors were similar  significant differences across sexuality or gender were limited to the perpetration of abuse relating to suspicion and possessiveness  where men were more likely to report this than the other gender groups  and women were less likely to report this  of those reporting abuse in their current relationship  over half reported experiencing abuse in a primary relationship previously  with 60  reporting exposure to abuse as a child  partner abuse in their current relationship predicted current levels of increased emotional distress  with reduced satisfaction with the current relationship having an indirect impact on this association  resilience traits were not a predictor or mediator  the results demonstrate the similarity in abuse across lgbti communities despite the diversity of genders  sexualities and experiences within these groups  the results are discussed with regard to directions for future research and implications for practice   c  2017 elsevier ltd  all rights reserved  
 patent litigation in europe we compare patent litigation cases across four european jurisdictions germany  the uk  england and wales   france  the netherlands using case level data gathered from cases filed in the four jurisdictions during the period 2000 2008  overall  we find substantial differences across jurisdictions in terms of caseloads notably  courts in germany hear by far the largest number of cases  not only in absolute terms  but also when taking macro economic indicators into account and we further find important cross country variances in terms of case outcomes  moreover  we show empirically that a considerable number of patents are litigated across multiple european jurisdictions  and further  that in the majority of these cases divergent case outcomes are reached across the different jurisdictions  suggesting that the long suspected problem of inconsistency of decision making in european patent litigation is in fact real  finally  we note that the coming into force of the unified patent court in europe may  in the long term  help to alleviate this inconsistency problem

 penological developments in contemporary china  populist punitiveness vs  penal professionalism this article examines the penal development in china over the last six decades to understand the ways in which populist punitiveness functions in the chinese political and social contexts  it argues that populist punitiveness in china is a  top down  process whereby manipulative political elites play on public anxieties and fears of crime and social insecurity to serve different political objectives of the chinese communist party  while public sentiment was promoted and reflected in penal policy in revolutionary  1950s 1970s  and reform  1970s 1990s  china  their influence  in the post reform era  2000s    has been blocked or filtered by the political will due to the emergence of a series of moderate political agendas  a new penal politics that favors professional knowledge over public opinion to serve the country s soft governance strategy is now taking shape in contemporary penal regime to prevail china s policy making power and process   c  2017 elsevier ltd  all rights reserved  
 people with autism spectrum disorder in the workplace  an expanding legal frontier over the past two decades  there has been a significant increase in the number of children diagnosed with autism spectrum disorder  asd   recent estimates suggest that asd may affect as many as one out of every 68 children in the united states  an increase of over 78  since 2007  although some of this increase can be attributed to the enhanced awareness and focus on early intervention resulting from public education campaigns  much of the cause remains unknown  nearly half of all individuals diagnosed with asd possess either average or above average intelligence  but only a small percentage are employed  regardless of their level of educational attainment or individual qualifications  one study of adults with high functioning autism identified employment  as the single biggest issue or barrier facing them   in the next eight years alone  experts predict a 230  increase in the number of young people with asd transitioning to adulthood  as these numbers grow  there inevitably will be pressure to change the status quo and expand employment opportunities for them  at the same time  as a result of the amendments to the americans with disabilities act  litigants of all disabilities are increasingly successful in establishing coverage under the statute and increasing protection against disability discrimination in employment  taken together  there is little doubt that increasing numbers of individuals with asd will enter the labor pool over the next decade  this shift presents a tremendous opportunity both for people with autism to integrate into the workforce and for employers to tap into the talents and abilities of a sizable population of workers  at the same time  it unquestionably will create new legal challenges for employers attempting to accommodate this set of workers  many of whom will have unique needs  this article explores the legal issues that are likely to arise in the context of the employment of people with asd  recognizing that there is a great deal of diversity in functioning among people on the spectrum  its focus is on those who are sufficiently high functioning to be capable of holding mainstream  independent employment  
 petitioning for involuntary commitment for chemical dependency by medical services patients who have chemical dependency  cd  are commonly encountered on medical and surgical wards  often for illnesses and injuries sustained as a direct result of their substance abuse  when these patients are repeatedly admitted to the hospital in certain states that provide a legal framework to commit chemically dependent persons to a treatment facility  clinicians often wonder whether they should initiate that process  should consulting psychiatrists choose to initiate the commitment process  they put into motion a resource intensive  time consuming mechanism  with uncertain outcomes  both in the courtroom and at the bedside  petitioning for involuntary commitment to chemical dependency treatment of a patient from medical and surgical services is poorly understood  in this study  we examined a series of patients for whom petitions for judicial commitment in the state of minnesota were entered over a 12 month period  and evaluated the likelihood of commitment to treatment  the demographics of patients involved  and the outcomes for this series of patients  three vignettes are presented to illustrate the severity of these patients  illnesses and potential outcomes of the process  we further describe potential limitations of the commitment system and alternatives to cd commitment that could be explored further  
 pharmaceutical federalism there is growing interest in states regulating pharmaceuticals in ways that challenge the u s  food and drug administration s  fda  federal oversight  for example  in 2013  maine enacted a law to permit the importation of unapproved drugs  reflecting concerns that federal requirements are too restrictive  while in 2014 massachusetts banned an fda approved painkiller  reflecting concerns that federal requirements are too lax  this article provides an account of this recent state interest in regulating drugs and considers its consequence s  it argues that these state regulatory efforts  and the nascent litigation about them  demonstrate that the preemptive reach of the fda s authority extends into medical practice regulation in some circumstances  it then begins to explore implications outside of the preemption context  arguing that state regulatory efforts may also help to inform our general understanding of both the scope of the fda s jurisdiction and the relationship between the fda and the states  
 piling on  an empirical study of parallel derivative suits using a sample of all companies named as defendants in securities class actions between july 1  2005 and december 31  2008  we study parallel suits relying on state corporate law arising out of the same allegations as the securities class actions  we test several ways that parallel suits may add value to a securities class action  most parallel suits target cases involving obvious indicia of wrongdoing  moreover  we find that although a modest percentage of parallel suits are filed first  over 80 percent are filed after a securities class action  termed follow on parallel suits   we find that parallel suits and  in particular  follow on parallel suits sometimes target individual officers not already named as defendants in the securities class action  suing more officers  however  does not positively correlate with an increase in settlement incidence  monetary recovery amounts  or attorney fees  parallel suits sometimes result in settlements when the corresponding class action is dismissed  however  only rarely do the parallel suit settlements provide monetary recovery for investors  we find that follow on parallel suits often result in nonmonetary  corporate governance settlements  particularly for frequent filing plaintiffs  attorneys  corporate governance settlements correlate with significantly lower attorney hours and attorney fees for the plaintiffs  attorneys  we conclude that such settlements are used to justify fees in cases in which there is no monetary recovery  
 police officers  ability to detect lies within a deception paradigm this study aimed to examine police officers  accuracy in classifying guilty and innocent participants using 3 interviewing styles  evidence focused  relationship focused  and control   in a modified version of russano  meissner  narchet  and kassin s  2005  deception paradigm  participants who had violated a rule  i e   cheating while solving problems  were considered guilty  whereas those who had followed the rule were considered innocent  after interviewing 234 adult men  11 experienced male police officers accurately classified over 90  of them as guilty or innocent  of 160 participants who did not admit to cheating  140  87 5   were correctly classified  there was no statistically significant relationship between interviewing style and police officers  identifications of guilty deniers  i e   liars  and innocent deniers  truth tellers   however  interviewers were more likely to believe guilty deniers in the evidence focused condition  and they tended to believe innocent deniers in the relationship focused condition  these findings suggest that the ability to detect deception might be influenced by interviewing style  
 police reports of mock suspect interrogations  a test of accuracy and perception a 2 phased experiment assessed the accuracy and completeness of police reports on mock interrogations and their effects on people s perceptions  in phase 1  16 experienced officers investigated a mock crime scene  interrogated 2 innocent suspects 1 described by the experimenter as more suspicious than the other and filed an incident report  all 32 sessions were covertly recorded  the recordings were later used to assess the reports  in phase 2  96 lay participants were presented with a brief summary of the case and then either read 1 police report  read 1 verbatim interrogation transcript  or listened to an audiotape of a session  results showed that  a  police and suspects diverged in their perceptions of the interrogations   b  police committed frequent errors of omission in their reports  understating their use of confrontation  maximization  leniency  and false evidence  and  c  phase 2 participants who read a police report  compared to those who read a verbatim transcript  perceived the process as less pressure filled and were more likely to misjudge suspects as guilty  these findings are limited by the brevity and low stakes nature of the task and by the fact that no significant effects were obtained for our suspicion manipulation  suggesting a need for more research  limitations notwithstanding  this study adds to a growing empirical literature indicating the need for a requirement that all suspect interrogations be electronically recorded  to provide a more objective and accurate account of what transpired  this study also suggests the benefit of producing verbatim transcripts

 political parties  voting systems  and the separation of powers this article aims to show that whatever the formal arrangements on the separation or  fusion  of executive and legislative powers whether presidential  parliamentary  or semi presidential the way any constitution operates in terms of concentrating or dispersing power is significantly a function of both the political party and electoral systems in place  they can not only fuse what a constitution s executive legislative relations provisions separate  but also separate what they fuse  as a result  the same set of institutional relations can function quite differently in separation of powers terms depending on party and electoral system contexts  in so doing  the article broadens and deepens the insight that the original madisonian framework of institutional competition between the president and congress has been rewritten by the subsequent  unanticipated development of the modern political party system  so that concentration or dispersal of political power unified or divided government depends mostly on electoral outcomes  it broadens the insight by showing this is true of all forms of government and not only the u s  presidential system  it deepens it by drilling down one layer further and taking into account how party systems and electoral outcomes are themselves affected by the method of voting employed  the article seeks to counter the tendency of constitutional lawyers to focus on interbranch relations alone and to overlook other important institutional variables in thinking about separation of powers and constitutional design more generally  it also aspires  through the use of comparative and historical examples  to enhance our understanding of the u s  system of  separation of parties  not powers   
 political rents under alternative forms of judicial review opponents of bills that are approved in the legislature frequently pursue subsequent judicial challenges based on constitutional grounds in order to overturn them  such challenges may occur through a specific legal case as in the u s   concrete judicial review  or through the petition of an opposition party at the constitutional court as in many parliamentary democracies  abstract judicial review   while the decision making process of high court justices has been widely studied  the effect of anticipated judicial review on the composition of bills introduced in the legislature has received limited attention  this paper theoretically analyzes how the institutions of concrete and abstract judicial review influence the political rents associated with a bill when the justices decide solely based on the bill s ideological component  the results indicate that abstract review may lead in equilibrium to a greater diffusion of rents across the political spectrum through its anticipatory effect  while the rents under concrete review are more concentrated among the legislative winning coalition  when this is the case  abstract review improves the equilibrium payoff of the party that would be left out of the legislative winning coalition under concrete review and favors those parties that command large rents in the status quo   c  2017 elsevier inc  all rights reserved  
 polygamous marriage  monogamous divorce could the constitutional right to marry also encompass polygamy  that question  which has long intrigued legal scholars  has taken on even greater significance in the wake of obergefell v  hodges  this article answers that question in a novel way by scrutinizing the practice of plural marriage through the lens of economic game theory  exploring the extreme harms that would befall the state should polygamy become law  more specifically  the article delves into the ex ante consequences of legalization  not on practicing polygamists  as is typically the focus   but on sequential bigamists   that is  those who never intend to have more than one spouse at any given time but who nonetheless marry more than one person in their lifetime  the article concludes that the state has a compelling economic interest in limiting marriage to two people  if polygamy were to become the law of the land  states could no longer prohibit bigamy  in turn  separating couples would lose one of the strongest incentives they currently have to choose formal divorce proceedings over the seemingly simpler option of mutual desertion  the threat of criminal charges for bigamy  in essence  a sequential bigamist could then marry multiple times in his lifetime without ever divorcing and  at the same time  without risking a criminal charge of bigamy  such actions   dubbed  sequential polygamy    would compromise the state s interest in protecting its citizens from financial harms  after all  divorce proceedings provide the state with an opportunity to intercede into the process  thereby obtaining some assurance that those who are leaving a marriage are not doing so at their financial peril  with the legalization of polygamy  however  bigamy becomes a thing of the past  eroding the state s ability to encourage divorce as a means of safeguarding the health and safety of its citizens  most concerning is the impact this change would have on those living in poverty   the people likely to be hardest hit by any societal shift away from formal divorce  finally  any attempts by the state to distinguish between bigamy and polygamy  for example  by permitting plural marriage but only if all spouses consent   would fail to ameliorate the resulting harm to its citizens  
 post sovereignty and the european legal space the political constitution of the european polity has become strained in recent years by insistent pressures on its institutional capacity to resolve social problems  the article examines the eu s polity crisis in the context of the development of a distinctive modern conception of secular constitutional authority  focused on the ideal of sovereign self determination  as the work of neil maccormick illustrates  the eu provides a radical challenge to the on going capacity of the concept of sovereignty to provide a framework to address problems of legitimacy  the article explores the nature of this challenge  its historical context and its consequences with reference to debates over the nature of constitutional pluralism  it sets out a path to the renewal of the european constitutional debate through a re consideration of secular constitutional authority and the necessity of its connection to the idea of sovereignty  the article seeks to re engage in the task of questioning sovereignty   
 posting of workers across the eu  an empirical investigation this paper investigates the effects of the intra european posting of workers on domestic labour markets in the years 2007 2009  instrumental variables related to neighbouring countries  populations are used to address the endogeneity between posting and labour market features  contrary to conventional wisdom  we find that an intensification of posting inflows is not likely to displace domestic workers  at any educational levels  instead  an increase in posting from abroad may raise domestic labour costs  no significant effects are found on sending country labour market variables  results point towards the development of possible synergies between domestic and posted workers  so that posting can actually improve labour efficiency and put upward pressure on labour costs  
 power relations in employment disputes this article reconceptualizes the operation of power relations in employment disputes  we draw on foucault s theory of neo liberal governance to inform our analysis of empirical data exploring how low income workers make decisions about whether to engage with the employment tribunal system  particular focus is placed on the ways the state governs employment disputes to achieve ideologically driven objectives  we conclude  first  that power relations in employment disputes operate across a range of institutions and individuals  and that the state s role is powerful and ongoing  secondly  that power relations operate to shape not just the objective context that workers find themselves in when experiencing an employment dispute but also workers  subjective moral codes about appropriate courses of action to take  and thirdly  that despite the powerful influence of the state  workers continue to hold non economic values that guide their perception of the appropriate basis for relations between employers and workers  
 preservation  primacy  and process  a more consistent approach to state constitutional interpretation in iowa between 2010 2015  the iowa supreme court decided multiple cases under article i  section 8 of the iowa constitution  however  the court s reasons for deciding issues under the iowa constitution were less than principled  the iowa supreme court s current practice of spontaneously interpreting the iowa constitution raises significant jurisprudential problems  it does not necessarily require lawyers to adequately argue  brief and preserve state constitutional issues for appeal  it does not prioritize federal or state constitutional claims in any order  and the approach seems arbitrary on its face  a more principled approach to state constitutional interpretation could remedy these issues  the primacy approach is an approach to state constitutional interpretation under which state supreme courts decide issues under the state constitution when the parties adequately argue and brief the state constitutional issue  this note argues that the iowa supreme court should adopt the primacy approach to state constitutional interpretation to continue the court s role as an important part of the united states  federalist system and an imperative protector of iowans  individual rights  to improve the efficiency of state constitutional interpretation  and to improve the process by which the iowa supreme court reaches issues under the iowa constitution  
 presidential administration and the durability of climate consciousness president obama took executive actions to address climate change that far exceeded previous presidents  efforts to pursue policy objectives through presidential administration  this note does not focus on the obama administration s major climate change regulations and international agreements  which have already attracted much attention  rather  this note identifies a concerted but inconspicuous effort to embed climate consciousness throughout the executive branch  elevating climate change as a key decisional criterion for federal departments and agencies  this note explains how the obama administration s efforts exhibited a delicate interplay with the judicial and legislative branches  responding to a judicial demand for rigorous administrative reasoning about climate change while sidestepping congressional hostility to climate change action by finding a narrow zone of congressional inattention  although conventional wisdom counsels that subsequent presidents may easily reverse polfcies advanced through presidential administration  the obama administration s efforts to advance climate consciousness may prove surprisingly durable due to formal legal constraints  bureaucratic inertia  and public bacldash  
 pressured into a preference to leave  a study on the  specific  deterrent effects and perceived legitimacy of immigration detention immigration detention is formally not a punishment  but governments do use it to deter illegal residence  this study examines whether and how immigration detention affects detainees  decision making processes regarding departure  thereby possibly resulting in de facto specific deterrence  semistructured face to face interviews were conducted in the netherlands with 81 immigration detainees  and their case files were examined  evidence is found for a limited  selective deterrence effect at the level of detainee s attitudes  most respondents considered immigration detention a painful and distressing experience  but only a minoritymostly labor migrants without family ties in the netherlandsdeveloped a preference to return to their country of citizenship in hopes of ending their exposure  including repeated exposure  to the detention  in line with defiance theory  we find that eventual deterrent effects mostly occurred among detainees who also attributed some measure of legitimacy to their detention  among some detainees  the detention experience resulted in a preference to migrate to a neighboring european country  
 preventing neonatal abstinence syndrome within the opioid epidemic  a uniform facilitative policy the united states is currently in the midst of an opioid epidemic that has  hit states in southern new england particularly hard with massachusetts as one primary example  one of the many unfortunate consequences of the epidemic is a dramatic upsurge in cases of opioid use disorder by pregnant women  often resulting in children born with neonatal abstinence syndrome  neonatal abstinence syndrome is a clinical syndrome that occurs when a newborn suffers withdrawal symptoms as a consequence of abrupt discontinuation of prenatal substance exposure  the expenses of treating  monitoring  and rehabilitating these chemically dependent newborns are predominantly shouldered by state taxpayers and are extremely costly  with a mean cost per stay exceeding  90 000 for pharmacologically treated cases  this article illustrates a policy  grounded in facilitative principles  designed to reduce the rate of neonatal abstinence syndrome in the commonwealth of massachusetts  early identification of opioid misuse during pregnancy is the threshold requirement of the proposed solution s success  another key component of the policy necessitates implementation of a standardized protocol to be adhered to uniformly throughout public hospitals statewide  the article concludes by reemphasizing the importance of acting promptly and assertively to protect society s most vulnerable members from the opioid epidemic  
 preventing violence  exploitation and abuse of persons with mental disabilities  exploring the monitoring implications of article 16 of the united nations convention on the rights of persons with disabilities article 16 of the united nations convention on the rights of persons with disabilities includes the right to be free from all forms of violence  exploitation and abuse  in pursuance of this aim  article 16  3  imposes an obligation on states parties to  ensure that all facilities and programmes designed to serve persons with disabilities are effectively monitored by independent authorities   effective independent monitoring is viewed as a key mechanism to help safeguard people from violence  exploitation and abuse  this is highly pertinent in the wake of the highly publicized abuse of patients in care homes and hospitals in england in the last few years  this article examines the monitoring requirements of article 16 and  by drawing on the author s research into the care quality commission  the national health and social care regulator and mental health monitor  in england  assesses the extent to which independent inspection of hospitals and care homes can play a part in realizing article 16 3  to prevent violence  abuse and exploitation of persons with mental disabilities  the potential scope and reach of article 16 is extremely wide  this brings with it great potential but  at the same time  significant challenges for achieving effecting monitoring  some of these challenges are explored and the paper concludes with some consideration of how monitors inspectors  such as the care quality commission in england  can strengthen their protection for people with mental disabilities  in line with the ethos and aspirations of the crpd   c  2017 elsevier ltd  all rights reserved

 prison work programs in a model of deterrence this article considers the social desirability of prison work programs in a model in which the function of imprisonment is to deter crime  two types of prison work programs are studied voluntary ones and mandatory ones  a voluntary work program is socially beneficial  if prisoners are paid a wage that just compensates them for their disutility from work  the deterrent effect of the prison sentence is unaffected  but society obtains the product of the work program  but a mandatory work program is superior to a voluntary work program  if prisoners are forced to work without compensation  the deterrent effect of the prison sentence rises  allowing society to restore deterrence and save resources by reducing the probability of detection or the sentence length  and also to obtain greater output than under the optimal voluntary work program  in an extension of the basic analysis  however  in which prisoners vary in their disutility from work  a voluntary work program may be superior to a mandatory work program because prisoners with relatively high disutility from work can elect not to work

 probabilistic compliance uncertain legal standards are pervasive but understudied  the key theoretical result showing an ambiguous relationship between legal uncertainty and optimal deterrence remains largely undeveloped  and no alternative conceptual approaches to the economic analysis of legal uncertainty have emerged  this article offers such an alternative by shifting from the well established and familiar optimal deterrence theory to the new and unfamiliar probabilistic compliance framework  this shift brings the analysis closer to the world of legal practice and yields new theoretical insights  most importantly  lower uncertainty tends to lead to more compliant positions and greater private gains  in contrast  the market for legal advice tends to reduce compliance over time a trend that a regulator may counter either by clarifying the law or by reiterating the law s continuing ambiguity  if detection is uncertain  the probabilistic compliance framework reveals why  contrary to the prevailing view  the standard damages multiplier should be used to counter detection uncertainty but not legal uncertainty  the article also reconciles economists  and lawyers  understanding of probabilities  highlights the challenges of modeling risk bearing costs resulting from uncertain legal commands  and provides theoretical support for gain based sanctions beyond the limited settings where the complete deterrence theory has justified their use thus far  
 procedural events  judge characteristics  and the timing of settlement we draw on a unique  detailed dataset of civil cases adjudicated at a major belgian court and use the competing risks framework to examine how the timing of settlement depends  first  on the completion of key procedural events and  second  on the characteristics of the adjudicating judge  congruent with recent research that emphasizes the importance of information flows  we find that the time to settlement is negatively associated with the completion of those procedural events that most effectively facilitate the revelation of new factual information  consistent with both rational choice and behavioral theories of litigation  other procedural events are unassociated or even positively associated with the time to settlement  finally  exploiting the de facto random nature of within chamber assignment of cases to the serving judges  we find robustly statistically significant evidence of a judge gender effect   c  2017 elsevier inc  all rights reserved  
 procedural normative system of the international court of justice on the basis of a thorough empirical analysis  the article comes to a number of theoretical conclusions which have never previously been discussed in the literature  in particular  it demonstrates that the court s procedure is governed not only by  procedural law  but also by norms which are non legal  moreover  it clearly circumscribes which norms in the documents relating to the functioning of the court are procedural and which lack this character  in their entirety  provisions governing the court s procedure form a  normative system   with the law being only one of its elements  the court s procedural norms originate both from the traditional sources of international law as well as from sources which  according to the usual classification  do not necessarily belong to that category  the procedural norms that are derived from all of these sources  while not tending towards uniformity in terms of their characteristics and effect  nevertheless form a system which operates as a whole  the procedure of the international court of justice does not fit neatly within the general scheme of  legal versus non legal norms   neither can one readily apply the theory of traditional sources of international law to a procedural system which brings together heterogeneous elements and must therefore be explained keeping in mind its own logic and nature  
 producing the product  a case study of law and its absence in this article  we seek to develop socio legal studies through a rupturing of the ideas behind the social and the legal  ideas that are most often presumed to exist and are used to explain that which is already there  the ubiquity of law and the omniscience of society have become givens  we use a product called shared ownership as a case study  arguing that the product was given life by a legal document  the lease  which itself represented the translation of a range of different perspectives and audiences  albeit not the consumer   and which  itself  has been translated  most notably in a 2008 high court decision  that decision counterintuitively found that the lease had created an assured shorthold tenancy  albeit a long one  but  despite its threat to the product  has been largely ignored  we discuss the processes of  and reasons for  the translation through which that ignorance has been induced  
 project safe neighborhoods in chicago  looking back a decade later project safe neighborhoods  psn  is a federally funded initiative that brings together federal  state  and local law enforcement to reduce gun violence in urban centers  in chicago  psn implemented supply side gun policing tactics  enhanced federal prosecution of gun crimes  and notification forums warning offenders of psn s heightened criminal sanctions  prior evaluations provide evidence that psn initiatives have reduced crime in the first few years of their operation  but over a decade after the program was established  we still know little about whether these effects are sustained over an extended period of time  this article examines psn chicago  an anti violence program in operation since 2002  consistent with a previous evaluation  we find that several program components were associated with reductions in violence in the initial target areas  these associations  however  are concentrated in the first few years of the intervention  we also examine the effect of psn in several subsequent expansion areas and find no detectable effects  we suggest that the effects of psn were diluted as the program expanded to larger areas of the city without an increase in funding or resources  still  we recommend that future research consider psn s strategies in chicago that appeared effective in the early years and leverage those insights for future programs  
 promises and pitfalls of evidence based policymaking  observations from a nonpartisan legislative policy research institute this article is concerned with evidence based policymaking and the potential for research in psychology and other social science disciplines to contribute to this process  policymaking is complex and incorporates many factors and voices  rigorous empirical evidence is one potential factor in this process  but the degree to which it is built into  sought after  or accepted in policymaking varies considerably  from the vantage point of psychologists within a nonpartisan legislative policy research organization in the united states  we offer observations on building credibility  communicating effectively  and avoiding common pitfalls that researchers in psychology and other social science disciplines may encounter as they engage in this process  we also draw from our experiences in this setting to outline key features of research design and process that can enhance the policy relevance of research evidence  finally  we highlight the field of early childhood education as one example of a long term exchange between research and policy  briefly reviewing early work in this area before moving into recommendations for future directions to address policy relevant questions

 promoting dialogue between history and socio legal studies  the contribution of christopher w  brooks and the  legal turn  in early modern english history although history  legal history  and socio legal studies significantly overlap in concerns  methods  values and history  and a common tradition  these commonalities are frequently overlooked  in seeking to promote greater dialogue between these disciplines  this article examines their complex interaction  arguing that the work of socio legal scholars  historians  and legal historians would benefit from greater cross fertilization  it focuses on the legal turn  in recent history writing on early modern england  particularly christopher w  brooks s ground breaking analysis of the nature and extent of legal consciousness throughout society  and the central role of law and legal institutions in the constitution of society  it then outlines some areas of common interest and  having highlighted the increasing convergence between history  legal history  and socio legal studies  concludes that greater dialogue would enhance our understanding of the role of law in society  and of society  and would be of more than mere historical interest  
 property is only another name for monopoly the existing system of private property interferes with allocative efficiency by giving owners the power to hold out for excessive prices  we propose a remedy in the form of a tax on property  based on the value self assessed by its owner at intervals  along with a requirement that the owner sell the property to any third party willing to pay a price equal to the self assessed value  the tax rate would reflect a tradeoff between gains from allocative efficiency and losses to investment efficiency  likely in the range of 5 to 10 percent annually for most assets  we discuss the detailed design of this system from an economic and legal perspective  
 prosecution of the offence of female genital mutilation cutting in norway more than 50 cases of female genital mutilation cutting  fgm c  have been reported to the norwegian police over the last 10 years  none has resulted in a conviction  lack of convictions relative to the number of estimated cases of fgm c and girls at risk is an issue discussed in many european countries  in the study reported here  20 out of 53 documented cases in the norwegian police register have been analysed  and 20 policemen and 5 doctors interviewed  the study finds that there are many obstacles for police work when it comes to producing evidence that can be strong enough for building a case for the courts  medical forensic experts as well as the child protection services have important roles in the building of a case  this article analyses the challenges that they face  and their collaboration and interaction with the police  the processes of investigation and the action taken by the different systems are stressful and painful for the families and can be experienced as punishment by both guilty and innocent parents  the processes themselves can have a deterrent effect  the study finds that there are greater risks for traumatic stress and painful reactions when families have both cut and uncut daughters  
 prosecutor risk  maturation  and wrongful conviction practice in this article we rethink the connection between prosecutorial experience and conviction psychology that undergirds much of the academic literature about wrongful convictions  the conviction psychology account of prosecutorial behavior asserts that prosecutorial susceptibility to cognitive biases deepens over time  thereby increasing the risk that prosecutors will become involved in wrongful convictions the longer they stay in the profession  our interviews with more than 200 state prosecutors call into question the basis for this asserted correlation between prosecutorial experience and risk of misconduct  the prosecutors we met consistently reported that  all else equal  prosecutors tend to become more balanced  rather than more adversarial  over time  hence  the prosecutors who present the greatest risk of producing a wrongful conviction are those who are either inexperienced or resistant to the normal maturation process  for this reason  we suggest that wrongful conviction researchers and database designers pay closer attention to the variables associated with prosecutorial experience and resistance that might affect the development of prosecutorial maturity and the consequent risk of wrongful convictions

 psychopathy  criminal intentions  and abnormal appraisal of the expected outcomes of theft purposeimpaired emotional learning is one of the hallmark features of psychopathy  the abnormal processing of cues of reward and punishment  and its impact in decision making  has mostly been supported by laboratorial studies  in this report  we have analysed the effect of psychopathy in the formation of attitudestowards committing theft  and its impact in the intention to reoffend after release  methodsa self report instrument to characterize the predictors of the intention to reoffend was developed and administrated  along with the triarchic psychopathy measure  to a sample of 91 male inmates convicted for theft  resultsthe perceived rewards of theft mediated the association between psychopathic traits and the intention to reoffend  the analysis of the expectancy and value components of the attitude towards theft showed that psychopathic traits are associated with reduced expectancy of negative outcomes and increased expectancy of positive outcomes as a consequence of reoffending  conclusionsour results add support to the role of disrupted expectancy value learning and increased reward sensitivity as mediators of the increased probability to reoffend in psychopathy  
 pubertal development  social factors  and delinquent involvement among south korean male adolescents despite the growing attention paid by western criminologists to the effects of pubertal timing on youthful misconducts  criminology in the asian context has been slow to incorporate both pubertal timing and its interplay with other social risk factors into its research agenda  to bridge this gap  the present study examines the mechanisms underlying the association between pubertal development and delinquency among a sample of south korean male adolescents  the results indicate  as with western findings  that early pubertal development does increase delinquent behaviors  the relationship is linear and partially mediated by parental attachment and risk taking  parental attachment also moderates the effects of early pubertal development on delinquency  based on the results  implications for policy and research are discussed   c  2017 elsevier ltd  all rights reserved  
 public oversight systems for statutory auditors in the european union we provide a comparative overview of the process of implementation  harmonization and stabilization of public oversight systems for statutory auditors across the european union  eu  after directive 2006 43 ec  we build on institutional change theory to identify potential determinants as to why some countries still lag in this harmonization process  oversight systems are a key institutional factor to guarantee the quality of financial information  essential to maintain investors  confidence and deep and stable capital markets  thus  the harmonization of these systems has long been an objective of the eu  our analyses serve to identify  analyse and compare how eu countries have incorporated european wide requirements into their national legal systems  particularly  we study   1  basic characteristics of the system and bodies for public oversight   2  organizational structure   3  financing  4  transparency   5  supervisory  and  6  disciplinary mechanisms  we show that significant diversity still exists across systems and that both the incentives for institutional change and the distance between pre existing systems and the directive are important explanatory factors of the achieved level of harmonization  
 public participation in china s environmental lawmaking  in pursuit of better environmental democracy for a country without a mature representative democracy  the development of public participation mechanisms in lawmaking processes is of paramount importance and deserves research  in china  public participation in lawmaking through a one stage disclosure and comment process is now routine  and the revision of the environmental protection law beginning in 2012 gave birth to a new mechanism featuring a two stage disclosure and comment process  expanding public participation can benefit environmental democracy by bringing environmental insights and interests into environmental lawmaking  balancing economic and environmental interests and strengthening public participation in the implementation of law  recent environmental lawmaking activities with the new public participation mechanism show positive progress towards a more transparent and inclusive lawmaking process  but also limitations regarding the effective interaction between the public and the legislature  the meaningful consideration of public comments into legislative decisions  and the mobilisation of civil society and environmental ngos  china needs both short and long term measures to address the problems and thus fully realise the benefits of public participation  
 public reason and religion  the theo ethical equilibrium argument for restraint most public reason theorists believe that citizens are under a  duty of restraint   citizens must refrain from supporting laws for which they have only non public reasons  such as religious reasons  the theo ethical equilibrium argument purports to show that theists should accept this duty  on the basis of their religious convictions  theists  beliefs about god s nature should lead them to doubt moral claims for which they cannot find secular grounds  and to refrain from imposing such claims upon others  if successful  this argument would defuse prominent objections to public reason liberalism  this paper assesses the theo ethical equilibrium argument  with a specific focus on christian citizens  i argue that christians should seek theo ethical equilibrium  but need not endorse the duty of restraint  i establish this in part through examining the important theological concept of natural law  that discussion also points to more general and persistent problems with defining  public reasons

 purpose  policing  and the fourth amendment fourth amendment cases are replete with references to  purpose   typically  these references pertain to the motivations of individual officers and occasionally to those of public institutions  that courts pay attention to purpose is unsurprising  across many areas of law  an alleged wrongdoer s intentions are often critical to determining liability  a remedy  or both  purpose analysis in fourth amendment cases  however  is surprisingly confused  the supreme court has  without explanation  advanced separate frameworks for analyzing purpose objective  subjective  and programmatic  the only consistent thing about the three approaches is that they all fail to ensure that law enforcement agents behave transparently and honestly  the failure is particularly worrisome because of the increasingly salient role that purpose analysis has played in recent supreme court cases  this article contends that courts and policy makers should use purpose as an ex ante institutional design principle  this would be in stark contrast to its current role as a judicial device for ascertaining an actor s past motivations  a single enforcement bureaucracy should not be responsible for too broad a range of functions  particularly if those functions implicate very different levels of state coercion for example  enforcing felony narcotics laws as opposed to traffic laws  modern police departments tend to have sprawling mandates that sometimes make it impossible for policy makers and officers to differentiate and rank distinct goals  mandate sprawl is particularly problematic because it creates opportunities for pretextual searches and seizures police have access to a broad range of rationales to justify conduct actually carried out for impermissible motives  were enforcement bureaucracies required to differentiate enforcement activities by purpose  it would go a long way in curing this problem  
 qualitative methods for law review writing typical law review articles not only clarify what the law is  but also examine the history of the current rules  assess the status quo  and present reform proposals  to make theoretical arguments more plausible  legal scholars frequently use examples  they draw on cases  statutes  political debates  and other sources  but legal scholars often pick their examples unsystematically and explore them armed with only the tools for doctrinal analysis  unsystematically chosen examples can help develop plausible theories  but they rarely suffice to convince readers that these theories are true  especially when plausible alternative explanations exist  this project presents methodological insights from multiple social science disciplines and from history that could strengthen legal scholarship by improving research design  case selection  and case analysis  we describe qualitative techniques rarely found in law review writing  such as process tracing  theoretically informed sampling  and most similar case design  among others  we provide examples of best practice and illustrate how each technique can be adapted for legal sources and arguments

 racial anxiety many have embraced evidence from the mind sciences that our behaviors are often influenced by our implicit biases rather than our conscious beliefs  this is one reason why implicit bias has become a staple in trainings for judges  lawyers  police officers  teachers  and health care providers  while understanding that implicit bias is important  social science research demonstrates that implicit bias alone does not fully account for the racial dynamics that undermine student achievement and trigger disproportionately harsh discipline  diminish the efficacy of health care and affect morbidity and mortality rates  trigger harsher prison sentences  result in child removal  and lead to unnecessary uses of force by police against civilians  following the  behavioral realist  approach to provide the most empirically accurate understanding of human behavior  in this essay  we introduce  racial anxiety  as an additional lens for understanding racial disparities of all types  in the social psychological literature  racial anxiety refers to the concerns that often arise both before and during interracial interactions  people of color experience racial anxiety when they worry that they will be subject to discriminatory treatment  white people  on the other hand  experience it when they worry that they will be perceived as racist  racial anxiety can influence behaviors and judgments in ways that contribute to significant and unwarranted racial disparities even in the absence of both conscious and implicit racial bias  additionally  in concert with implicit racial bias  racial anxiety can aggravate interracial dynamics in ways that create significant harm  this essay explores how racial anxiety operates  discusses its probable effects on police civilian and doctor patient interactions  and highlights interventions for mitigating its effects  
 rational faith  the utility of fairness in copyright the biggest debate in copyright law is also the most fundamental  for what purpose does copyright exist  there are two schools of thought about the appropriate answer to this key question  the first  dominant school focuses on economic efficiency  while the second emphasizes fairness and other moral concerns  as evidenced by scholarly response to the blurred lines litigation and mark lemley s recent piece   faith based intellectual property   proponents of each school are often at odds with each other  there is little middle ground  this  either or  view of efficiency and moral rights is detrimental to a productive scholarly debate about the value of copyright  more importantly  it is wrong  scholars like jeanne fromer  christopher buccafusco  and david fagundes have recently pointed out that moral concerns are not necessarily inconsistent with  and could in some circumstances even promote  utilitarian ends  here  i reframe the debate by suggesting that the dichotomy between moral rights and utility should be abolished altogether  drawing on insights from neuroscience  psychology  and organizational behavior  i demonstrate that when it comes to creation  fairness a moral rights concern often is utility in a very real sense  the evidence suggests that treating creators fairly acts as a powerful motivator for creative work  results in objectively more creative output  and aligns well with public and legal decision makers  moral intuitions  in other words  the most efficient copyright system is a fair one  this conclusion has implications for both copyright scholarship and policy  on the scholarship side  it builds a tangible bridge between utilitarian and moral rights camps  moral rights advocates previously accused of blind faith in the value of fairly administered rights can now respond that their faith is rational  on the policy side  i explain how novel fairness enhancing mechanisms like individualized permissive use and an increased focus on distributive concerns in applying the fair use doctrine can increase the overall efficiency of the copyright system a proposition that should appeal to scholars on both sides of the debate  
 rationing criminal justice of the many diagnoses of american criminal justice s ills  few focus on externalities  yet american criminal justice systematically overpunishes in large part because few mechanisms exist to force consideration of the full social costs of criminal justice interventions  actors often lack good information or incentives to minimize the harms they impose  part of the problem is structural  criminal justice is fragmented vertically among governments  horizontally among agencies  and individually among self interested actors  part is a matter of focus  doctrinally and pragmatically  actors overwhelmingly view each case as an isolated  short term transaction to the exclusion of broader  long term  and aggregate effects  treating punishment like other public law problems of regulation suggests various regulatory tools as potential solutions  such as cost benefit analysis  devolution  pricing  and caps  as these tools highlight  scarcity often works not as a bug but as a design feature  criminal justice s distinctive intangible values  politics  distributional concerns  and localism complicate the picture  but more direct engagement with how best to ration criminal justice could help to end the correctional free lunch at the all you can eat buffet and put the bloated american carceral state on the diet it needs  
 re claiming disability  identity  procedural justice  and the disability determination process this research highlights the crucial role of an intimate link between a disabled person s self identity and the perceived fairness of legal procedures  in doing so  it brings to the foreground a wholly ignored aspect of procedural justice  earlier researchers have failed to delve into the role identity politics plays in the relationship between the institutions and the beneficiaries of their services  and the way different members of a group understand and define themselves  this research explores the way people with disabilities in the united states  with different kinds of disability identities  experience and evaluate the procedure of claiming social security benefits  the findings suggest that disabled people who identified with the social model of disability  as opposed to the medical individual models  hold a critical view of the procedure for retaining benefits  they felt they had no control over it  could not voice their opinions  were mistreated by representatives  and had to present an image that was not necessarily true of their disability  they also saw the procedure as discouraging them from participating fully in the labor market  and consequently integrating better in society  an idea that was not present among disabled people who identify with medical individual models  exposing this relationship between the way people perceive themselves and the way they experience and evaluate legal procedures can contribute to the creation of better policies  while improving communication between the state and members of the disability community  along with other marginalized groups

 reckless discrimination if there are known  easily adopted ways to reduce bias in employment decisions  should an employer be held liable for discriminatory results when it fails to adopt such measures  given the vast amount we now know about implicit bias and the ways to reduce it  to what extent is an employer who knowingly fails to do so engaging in intentional discrimination  this article theorizes a  recklessness  model of discrimination under title vii  arguing for liability where an employer acts with reckless disregard for the consequences of implicit bias and stereotyping in employment decisions  legal scholars have argued that title vii should  and in some ways does  reflect a negligence model under which an employer may be held liable for failing to meet a duty of care to prevent discrimination at work  yet the law of title vii disparate treatment requires  intentional  discrimination a term that courts have interpreted more broadly than a conscious purpose to discriminate  but more narrowly than a mere failure to prevent  societal  discrimination  this article is the first to propose recklessness as the bridge between the theory of negligence and the requirement of intent as defined by title vii jurisprudence  in doing so  the article seeks to revive the importance of social science research on bias research that was limited in its evidentiary role by the u s  supreme court s 2011 decision in wal mart v  dukes  decades of scientific research have documented how implicit bias and automatic stereotyping affect decision making in discriminatory ways  years of efforts by employers to reduce bias and increase diversity in their workforces have demonstrated what interventions work  most recently  technology has allowed some employers to easily and dramatically reduce the biasing effects of subjectivity from their hiring decisions by  for example  using algorithms instead of people to screen applicants  this vast body of research and experience developed over a half century has shifted the baseline knowledge about the risks of bias infecting employment decisions  this article contends  today  an employer who continues to rely on unchecked subjective decision making that leads to disproportionate employment outcomes by race or gender is acting so recklessly that its behavior amounts to intentional disparate treatment under title vii  
 reconceiving resilience  a new guiding principle for financial regulation  most postcrisis financial regulation is expressed to be in the pursuit of increasing the resilience of the global financial system   resilience  features in the formal title of the basel iii reforms to bank capital adequacy rules  this article explores the meaning of resilience from social ecological systems science and applies it to international finance  we conclude that postcrisis financial regulation has in fact sought to build a stronger  more robust system  not a more resilient one  the regulation imposed on global systemically important financial institutions is designed to make these institutions too strong to fail  not give them the capacity to reorganize themselves  or transition to a new equilibrium  in the face of major external shocks  this article challenges the fundamental thinking behind seven years of postcrisis financial regulation and suggests we need far more rigorous research into what a truly resilient international financial system would look like and how it would be regulated  
 reconceiving the roles of religious civil society organizations in transitional justice  evidence from the solomon islands  timor leste and bougainville in transitional justice  tj  scholarship  civil society is ordinarily conceived as a unified  homogeneous and secular entity that is simultaneously distinct from and complementary to the state  this article complicates these assumptions by examining the roles of faith based organizations and actors in tj processes in timor leste  the solomon islands and bougainville  it shows that civil society activity in these contexts is diverse and heterogeneous and that the lines dividing state  society and religion  and those separating civil society from states and societies  are difficult to draw  we argue that tj scholars would do well to pay close attention to the structural differences that exist within different societies  and which shape the contributions that civil society organizations make to tj practices  
 reconceptualising specialist environment courts and tribunals specialist environment courts and tribunals  secs  are  in the main  reflective of highly dynamic forms of adjudication  mixing judicial forms with powers more traditionally found in the executive  however  despite their novel legal nature the literature on secs is predominantly promotional and it fails to address the challenges to legitimacy and governance engendered by these institutions  nor does it evince a robust theory of environmental adjudication  these omissions not only impoverish the discourse but practice unsupported by theory is creating an unstable edifice  to illustrate this point the difficulties experienced in new zealand are examined  the argument is made that only by confronting the challenges created by secs can we begin to lay the foundations for a new theoretical model capable of explaining and accommodating environmental adjudication  
 reconciling regulatory space with external accountability through wto adjudication   trade  environment and development this article argues in favour of broadening the trade and environment debate in the world trade organization  wto  to include a developmental perspective  wto litigation involving environmental regulation touches upon the issue of global justice and the power asymmetries structurally embedded in the global economy  the recognition of the wto as a legitimate global institution  therefore  depends on its ability to reconcile the respect for the right to regulate with the need to give due regard to the interests and concerns of foreign constituencies affected by domestic regulation  by imposing other regarding obligations  wto law can act as a mechanism of external accountability of powerful states vis a vis affected foreigners  especially where asymmetric relations and different stages of economic development are involved  the article applies this framework to analyze the legal reasoning of the appellate body in the us tuna ii dispute between the us and mexico   a dispute illustrating the complex intertwinement between economic  environmental and developmental issues  it concludes that the use of the concepts of even handedness  and calibration  under article 2 1 of the technical barriers to trade agreement and article xx of the general agreement on tariffs and trade did not enable the appellate body to strike an adequate balance between the right to regulate and external accountability  while in the original report the appellate body used even handedness  to impose only a minimal level of external accountability on the us  in the compliance report  the appellate body has gone too far by failing to defer to the us risk assessment amidst scientific controversy and uncertainty  
 reconsidering positivity theory  what roles do politicization  ideological disagreement  and legal realism play in shaping us supreme court legitimacy  to what degree is the legitimacy of the u s  supreme court currently at risk  perhaps the most widely accepted view of how the supreme court acquires and maintains its legitimacy is positivity theory  which claims that the legitimizing symbols of judicial authority protect the court s legitimacy from dissatisfaction with its rulings  although research has shown that belief in legal realism does not itself threaten the court s legitimacy  positivity theory suggests that portrayals of the court as embroiled in politicsthat is  as just another political institutioncan undermine institutional legitimacy  still  some recent research recognizes that ideological disagreement poses a serious threat to the legitimacy of the supreme court  missing from extant literature is a reconciliation of how these three determinantsideological dissatisfaction  legal realism  and perceptions of judicial politicizationcombine to structure judicial legitimacy  understanding the difference between perceptions of an ideological court versus a politicized court for institutional legitimacy is our central purpose in this article  we discover that the greatest threats to the court s legitimacy lie in beliefs that judges are just ordinary politicians  not in ideological dissatisfaction or legal realism   we conclude by drawing out these findings  implications for the upcoming highly politicized battles over nominations to the high bench  
 reconsidering procedural consolidation for multinational corporate groups in the context of the recast european insolvency regulation procedural consolidation  as a solution to the rescue of insolvent multinational corporate groups   mcgs    is said to be able to preserve group value for creditors  this article explores the desirability of procedural consolidation in the eu in the light of theories of corporate rescue law  cross border insolvency law  multinational enterprises and relevant eu cases with reference to the european insolvency regulation  it argues that  based on current cross border insolvency rules in the eu  there is an inherent difficulty for procedural consolidation in balancing the goal of preservation of group value and the goal of certainty  the article also considers the new  group procedural co ordination proceedings  offered by the recast european insolvency regulation and argues that it may help to supplement the gap left by the procedural consolidation in the eu  copyright  c  2017 insol international and john wiley   sons  ltd  
 redefining contractual capacity  the un convention on the rights of persons with disabilities and the incapacity defence in english contract law how can the incapacity defence in contract law coexist with the concept of universal legal capacity advanced by the un convention on the rights of persons with disabilities  crpd   in the absence of clear guidance from the crpd on the link between legal capacity and mental capacity  and given the silence of this convention on the concept of contractual capacity  this article stresses the need to redefine contractual capacity in a manner that responds not only to economic interests  eg upholding the security of transactions  but also to social interests  including the protection of values such as dignity   the discussion insists that incapacity and disability must never be conceptually equated and calls for a definition of contractual incapacity that moves beyond the medical condition of individuals  whether this is known by or apparent to the other contracting party  and which considers the circumstances of the transaction  these arguments are explored in the context of english contract law  focusing on the question of contractual validity when a party lacked the mental capacity to understand the transaction and the other party was unaware of the incapacity and acted in good faith  
 redirecting the analysis in hospital mergers there is currently a glaring gap between the economic tools available in antitrust analysis and the practical application of such tools by antitrust attorneys and judges  this disconnect is blatantly evident in the context of hospital mergers  where courts are allowing anticompetitive hospital mergers to go forward and harm consumers by facilitating more expensive  lower quality medical services  for years  courts and lawyers have relied on structural methods of analysis  such as market shares and hhis  in mergers within all industries  however  such methods are arbitrary and burdensome  primarily because traditional methods typically create overly broad geographic markets that allow anticompetitive mergers to go unnoticed  a more reliable framework is available to courts and lawyers in the form of direct competitive effects analysis  tools such as diversion ratios and willingness to pay can be calculated using publicly available data and is not bound by any strict geographic boundary  such tools therefore lead to more robust and accurate results in determining whether a hospital merger may pose harm to patients and health plan enrollees  although some courts have already relied on direct effects analysis to enjoin hospital mergers in the last decade  the focus on direct effects by economists has far surpassed utilization by courts and lawyers  because of its significant and easily attainable benefits  the legal system should increase reliance on direct effects analysis to more effectively argue  adjudicate  and evaluate hospital mergers to better protect consumers  
 reforming investor state dispute settlement  a  comparative and international  constitutional law framework as a result of the steep increase in investment arbitrations  and the problems this has brought to the fore  many reform efforts in international investment law focus on changes to investor state dispute settlement  isds   reform proposals  however  diverge widely  ranging from exiting the system completely to institutionalizing it further through the creation of an appellate mechanism or a permanent investment court  and do not proceed on the basis of a normative framework that is globally consented  this risks achieving needed systemic reform  the present article sets out the contours of such a normative framework  it suggests that the criticism of isds has its origins in frictions with constitutional principles  namely democracy  the rule of law  and human rights  reform proposals  as a consequence  should be developed by reference to principles of  comparative and international  constitutional law  such a framework can be used to formulate a number of concrete proposals for isds reform  in particular increased institutionalization of isds and the implementation of other mechanisms that allow states to ensure that isds develops in line with the principle of democracy and respect for the rule of law and for the protection of human rights  
 reforming the governance of international financial law in the era of post globalization international financial law  ifl  is evolving from a situation of acquiesced anarchy  characterized by coordination dilemmas  compliance gaps  and unwarranted independence of regulators  towards a more ordinate and coordinated framework  the conceptual crisis of the new international financial architecture  nifa  and the failure of the system of global division of regulatory labour between international financial institutions  ifis   international setting bodies  and national regulatory authorities have revealed a vacuum of power and mandate  hints of a shift in the global governance of financial markets are acknowledged in the reform of the financial sector assessment program  fsap  and in the potential role of the reports on observance of standards and codes  roscs   jointly administered by the ifis  the central role of the financial stability board  fsb  as global coordinator has significantly reinforced the functions of monitoring and rationalizing implementation  i e  with a creative result  of international regulatory standards  in combination with surveillance mechanisms by the international monetary fund  imf   in addition  fsb s constituency under the g 20 may render its political mandate as more acceptable by members and stakeholders at large  however  although the framework created in the aftermath of the financial crisis may allow for more coordinated solutions  effective action by governments is missing  this notwithstanding  ifl has largely achieved authoritative characters  in so far as it can determine outcomes and compel obedience  proceeding from ernst ulrich petersmann s posture that international economic law has failed to effectively protect public values and to ensure participatory democracy and global justice  while international law has historically protected individuals from governmental intervention and power abuse  the legitimacy of ifl is critically investigated  to this extent  the author addresses the superseded theory of transnational regulatory networks  trns   which has been partially resumed by the informal international lawmaking  in law  project  the compensatory approach advocated by the global administrative law  gal  scholarship  and a democratic striving approach  with a view to the upcoming scenario of  post globalization   as embodied by the trump presidency and by the brexit  the author envisages a renovated role of the intergovernmental  ministerial  cooperation within the fsb for the protection of global financial stability as public good  
 reforming wto civil society engagement civil society organizations are often seen as playing a crucial role in helping to mitigate the exclusion of weaker states  giving voice to marginalized communities  and raising environmental and developmental concerns within the trade system  the politicization and demystification of the global trade agenda by civil society also opens up space for a more diverse set of actors to influence trade negotiations  this article examines the evolution of the wto secretariat s engagement with civil society within this context and argues that the dominant mode of engagement  as manifest in wto public forums and civil society participation in ministerial conferences  is no longer fit for purpose  rather it reflects an outmoded strategy that once served to underscore the existence and value of the wto as an international organization and works to neutralize political contestation and publicly promote the benefits of free trade  it is now in need of reform  
 reframing ameliorative waste tension arises when two individuals have a property interest in the same thing  particularly when those interests span different time periods  divided ownership gives rise to the possibility that individuals with different interests will have different opinions regarding how that property should be used  property law must thus determine which interest holder s preferences should be honored  the doctrine of waste is one means by which the law attempts to govern multiple interest holders  rights  this article addresses the most controversial form of waste ameliorative waste which occurs when the current interest holder  without the consent of the future interest holder  makes a material alteration to the property and that alteration increases the market value of the property  most modern american commentators and courts examine ameliorative waste from an economic perspective  focusing on changes in the property s valuation  in stark contrast  the analytical framework for similar questions under roman law  early common law  and modern civil law systems centers around the type of alteration involved  each side of this dichotomous analysis views its rule as applying to all waste creating situations  assuming that a one size fits all approach creates just results for the many scenarios in which ameliorative waste arises  this article compares and critiques both the value based and the alteration based approaches  and evaluates the merits of each framework  the article concludes that both systems have substantial shortcomings and proposes an alternative framework that balances decision making authority between the two interest holding parties based on the particular context of their situation  
 regional clustering of chemicals and waste multilateral environmental agreements to improve enforcement illegal trade in chemicals and waste has brought severe negative impacts to human health and the environment  fragmentation of multilateral environmental agreements  meas  has challenged implementation due to disconnects and inconsistencies between regimes that causes inefficiencies  overlapping norms  and duplication  since the late 1990s  there have been proposals to cluster meas organizationally and functionally to create synergies between them  this paper evaluates whether the proposition on clustering of meas has worked in practice through an empirical case study of the  mea regional enforcement network  ren    mea ren sought to cluster at the organizational and functional elements of the basel convention  the rotterdam convention  the stockholm convention  and the montreal protocol in south and southeast asia  regarding organizational clustering  through co organizing regional network meetings cross mea learning was enhanced and costs were saved  but co locating regional offices proved more challenging  for the clustering of functional elements  mea enforcement was ultimately strengthened through several joint initiatives across meas  however  not all functions could be clustered as anticipated  including data reporting due to incompatibility between the conventions and overall workloads  the paper concludes with recommendations for future environmental enforcement  
 regional integration through law and international courts   the interplay between de jure and de facto supranationality in central america and the caribbean the article proposes an innovative theoretical framework outlining preconditions for regional international courts  rics  to act as engines of supranationality in different institutional and socio political contexts  in so doing  the article nuances the theoretical approaches to supranationality and supranational adjudication  the article focuses on the central american court of justice  cacj  and the caribbean court of justice  ccj   both courts have been branded institutional copies of the court of justice of the european union  cjeu   they have even borrowed key jurisprudential principles from the luxembourg court with the goal of expanding the reach of central american and caribbean community laws  yet  both the cacj and the ccj have thus far failed to foster supranationality in their respective systems  this is because the conditions allowing rics to become engines of integration lie  for the most part  beyond the direct control of the judges  most notably  with other institutional  political  and societal actors  such as national judges  regional organs  legal and political elites  as well as academics  the article thus suggests that rics can become engines of supranationality only to the extent to which they are supported by a set of institutional  political  and societal pre conditions allowing for the concrete enforcement of the rulings of the ric at the regional and national levels  
 registered cartels in austria  an overview cartels were legal to a large extent in austria until the country s eu accession in 1995  we examine archival material on registered horizontal cartels to learn about their inner working  applying content analysis to legally binding cartel contracts  we comprehensively document different collusion methods along the lines described by stigler  j political econ 72 44 61  1964   quota cartels employ regular reporting schemes and use compensation mechanisms for departures from set quotas  specialization cartels divide markets  and rely the least on information exchange and punishment  price and payment condition cartels primarily aim to prevent secret price cuts  requiring information provision upon request  allow for discretionary decision taking and  sometimes immediate  punishment  these stylized facts on the contractual arrangements suggest that the possibility to write legally binding agreements was employed to address the usual obstacles to sustain collusion  
 regulating arbitration enabled by supreme court decisions that grant contract drafters broad authority over the procedures used to resolve legal claims  agreements to arbitrate have proliferated in consumer and employment contracts  as arbitration has spread  so have demands for congress and federal administrative agencies to regulate it  but when does arbitration warrant regulation through new legislation and administrative action  the most prominent policy arguments for regulating arbitration focus on its effects on consumer welfare and democratic governance  by and large  the standard policy arguments for regulating arbitration do not grapple with arbitration s effects on specific regulatory statutes  this article explains arbitration s effects on the implementation and enforcement of federal regulatory statutes and argues that controlling these effects should be a central focus of efforts to regulate arbitration through new legislation and agency action  in hundreds of statutes  congress has created financial incentives for private litigants to enforce its laws  the enactment of incentives for private civil litigation allows litigants to assert claims that would be too expensive to prosecute under ordinary procedural rules  and  more importantly  allows congress to calibrate enforcement of federal law  by establishing stronger incentives for private enforcement of a statute e g   provisions that shift attorneys  fees to successful plaintiffs and provide enhanced damages congress drives enforcement of the statute  by providing weaker incentives  congress directs enforcement elsewhere  arbitration can dramatically alter the returns from enforcement of statutes with incentives for private civil litigation  in doing so  it may subvert or completely undermine congressional efforts to mobilize and calibrate private enforcement of federal law  these  enforcement effects  threaten congress s ability to accomplish substantive regulatory objectives through private civil litigation but have received only passing attention in discussions about the policy response to arbitration  to illustrate how greater attention to them would impact efforts to regulate arbitration  the article analyzes the consumer financial protection bureau s proposed arbitration regulation under 1028 of the dodd frank act and shows how it falls short of ensuring that certain consumer financial protection laws administered by the agency are enforced in the manner and to the extent contemplated by congress  
 regulating big data  the guidelines of the council of europe in the context of the european data protection framework in january 2017 the consultative committee of convention 108 adopted its guidelines on the protection of individuals with regard to the processing of personal data in a world of big data  these are the first guidelines on data protection provided by an international body which specifically address the issues surrounding big data applications  this article examines the main provisions of these guidelines and highlights the approach adopted by the consultative committee  which contextualises the traditional principles of data protection in the big data scenario and also takes into account the challenges of the big data paradigm  the analysis of the different provisions adopted focuses primarily on the core of the guidelines namely the risk assessment procedure  moreover  the article discusses the novel solutions provided by the guidelines with regard to the data subject s informed consent  the by design approach  anonymization  and the role of the human factor in big data supported decisions  this critical analysis of the guidelines introduces a broader reflection on the divergent approaches of the council of europe and the european union to regulating data processing  where the principle based model of the council of europe differs from the approach adopted by the eu legislator in the detailed regulation  eu  2016 679  in the light of this  the provisions of the guidelines and their attempt to address the major challenges of the new big data paradigm set the stage for concluding remarks about the most suitable regulatory model to deal with the different issues posed by the development of technology   c  2017 alessandro mantelero  published by elsevier ltd  all rights reserved  
 regulating excessive speculation  commodity derivatives and the global food crisis evidence suggests that commodity derivatives speculation contributed to extraordinary patterns of grain price volatility that led to a global food crisis in 2007 11  people in countries throughout the world are increasingly dependent on international commodity markets for access to food  almost everywhere  now  the value of food is determined by a single condensed symbol of its worthits price  persuaded of the need to ensure that this measure of value is not put at risk of distortion in the pursuit of financial profit  governments in the us and in the eu are now implementing new regulations designed to curb excessive  levels of speculation in derivative markets  carrying out an analysis of these regulatory measures  the article demonstrates that both sets of reforms suffer from a critical limitation  they are predicated on an inaccurate understanding of how activity in commodity derivative markets can impact on underlying food prices  if the new regulations for commodity derivative markets are not up to the task  as this article argues that they are not  a more fundamental revision of global economic structures may be required if the basic needs of human beings are not to be subsumed to the interests of financial capital in the years to come  
 regulating milk  women and cows in france and the united states animal milk  most commonly cow s milk  is one of the most heavily regulated commodities in both france and the united states  with the increasing popularity of breastfeeding and the possibility of pumping  freezing  and storing breast milk  a cottage industry has emerged for people wishing to buy  sell  or donate milk produced by humans  yet the legal landscape for human milk remains inchoate  prompting public health officials and medical professionals to call for tighter regulation  animal and human milk are typically viewed as two distinct substances with little in common beyond a name  in contrast  this article highlights the analogies between the two liquids as well as the female bodies that produce them  to do so  it draws on historical and comparative perspectives france and the united states  human milk in the twenty first century and animal milk in the nineteenth and twentieth centuries  similar political forces and cultural norms are at stake in milk regulation then and now  here and there  more precisely  the article shows that the campaign for increased oversight of human milk is driven by motivations similar to those which inspired cow s milk reform in the nineteenth century  economics  sexual control  and scientism  through this regulatory agenda  the providers of milk human lactating mothers and animal lactating mothers are commodified in surprisingly analogous ways  
 regulating the visible hands  development of rules on state owned enterprises in trade agreements the rise of modern state capitalism has cast doubt on the current global economic system and its assumption of a clear division between state and market  at the core of this systemic challenge are the state owned enterprises of the 21st century  unlike their predecessors  the state owned enterprises of today have been transformed into powerful tools for global competition  shrouded under corporate veils  with the existing legal framework both unyielding and unprepared to accommodate these new developments  the momentum for reform soon reached its zenith  the trans pacific partnership s chapter on state owned enterprises  the first stand alone chapter on the subject  should be analyzed in this context  it consolidates and updates preexisting rules by introducing a bright line definition of what state owned enterprises are and incorporates tools to enhance the enforceability of the rule  despite the significant accomplishments of the new rule and the rationale for the changes  the rule suffers from several shortcomings  this note provides a legal analysis and critical evaluation of the rule  focusing on how it departs from the preexisting rule and highlights the factors that undermine its effectiveness  to breathe life into this theoretical analysis and evaluation  the note also provides a case study of how the rule will affect a potential new entrant  south korea  
 regulation through deregulation  sharing economy companies gaining legitimacy by circumventing traditional frameworks the  sharing economy  is a term describing organized economic activity that may supplant the traditional corporate centered model and encourages peer to peer transactions  it is a system of sharing underused assets or services  for free or for a fee  directly from individuals  bypassing traditional  middle men   the sharing economy provides much of its services through on demand platform  such as mobile apps  and matches customer needs with providers to immediately deliver these goods and services  does the  sharing economy  share its risk with its consumers  should the sharing economy be regulated  what effect does the lack of regulation have on its consumers  and would implementation of more regulations change those effects  this note uses home sharing and ridesharing companies in san francisco as case studies to explore these questions  by comparing the hotel and the taxi industries  regulations with the emerging regulatory frameworks surrounding airbnb and uber  this note argues that these companies have been left to  self regulate   self regulation has not proven to be effective  and as a result  the health and safety of consumers has been put in jeopardy  this note argues that the regulatory regimes in place prior to the rise of the  sharing economy  should be revisited and appropriately restructured for these newly emerged business models  
 regulation  managing the antinomies of economic vice and virtue in the quarter century that social   legal studies has been published  regulation has emerged as a new  and for many exciting  interdisciplinary field  the concept itself requires a wider view of normativity than the narrow positivist one of law as command  it is certainly protean  ranging over many fundamental questions about the changing nature of the public sphere of politics and the state  and its interactions with the private  sphere of economic activity and social relations  as well as the mediation of these interactions  especially through law  this survey aims to outline and evaluate some of the main contours of the field as it has developed in this recent period  focusing on the regulation of economic activity  regulation is seen as having emerged with the withdrawal by governments from direct provision of many economic and social services  to be replaced by corporatist bureaucracies and quasi public agencies managing the complex public private interactions of financialized capitalism  the arguments for smart  regulation have  in an era fixated on neo liberalism  generally legitimized delegation of responsibility to big business  its advocates  having been drawn into policy fields  have perhaps too often lost their critical edge  and allowed it to become instrumentalized  reflecting the technicist character of its practice  
 relationality  culpability and consent in wartime  men s experiences of forced marriage rights based approaches to forced marriage in wartime document forms of harm women experience  to the exclusion of men s experiences  such framing problematically reiterates a binary of women men  victim perpetrator and consent coercion  arguably  this delineation is useful in supporting projects of culpability and legal redress  however  what does such vocabulary obfuscate or render invisible  we draw from the experiences of men demobilized from the lord s resistance army  lra  and presently living in northern uganda to consider how relationships and social accountabilities are governed in settings of coercion  we argue that forced marriage in wartime cannot be understood without examining the multiple relationalities on which it is contingent  we broaden the remit of men s relationships to women in the lra to consider how men s relations to each other and to their children shaped their experiences of marriage during the war  we conclude by reflecting on concepts of consent and culpability in coercive settings  
 relations between attorney temporal structure and children s response productivity in cases of alleged child sexual abuse purposeprevious research has demonstrated that attorney question format relates to child witness  response productivity  however  little work has examined the extent to which attorneys provide temporal structure in their questions  and the effects of this structure on children s responding  the purpose of this study was to address this gap in the literature to identify methods by which attorneys increase children s response productivity on the stand without risking objections from opposing counsel for calling for narrative answers   methodsin this study  we coded criminal court transcripts involving child witnesses  5 18years  for narrative structure in attorney questions and productivity in children s responses  half of the transcripts resulted in convictions  half in acquittals  balanced across key variables  child age  allegation severity  the child s relationship to the perpetrator  and the number of allegations  resultsprosecutors and defence attorneys varied substantially in their questioning tactics  prosecutors used more temporal structure in their questions and varied their questioning by the age of the child  these variations had implications for children s response productivity  conclusionsresults indicate that temporal structure is a novel and viable method for enhancing children s production of case relevant details on the witness stand  
 religion and judging on the federal courts of appeals we construct a database of federal appellate cases involving religious liberties decided between 2006 and 2015  expanding and improving an existing database covering up to 2005  the data are used to investigate the role of religion in judicial decision making  we find that jewish judges are significantly more likely than their non jewish colleagues to favor claimants in religious liberties cases  but we find no significant effects for other minority religions  our findings confirm previous findings in the literature  but we go a number of steps further than existing studies in uncovering the sources of jewish judges  influence  we conclude that the effect of jewish judges comes through their increased concern for the separation of church and statenot through their heightened solicitude for the interests of religious minorities in practicing their religion or through preferential treatment of jewish claimants  further  our analysis of cases not involving religion shows that the pro claimant effect of jewish judges is attributable not to a general liberal attitude but to a particular secular concern for the separation of church and state  finally  we are the first researchers to go beyond individual effects and investigate the panel effects of judges  religious affiliation  our findings in this regard have suggestive implications for identifying the mechanism of panel effects  
 religion at work  evaluating hostile work environment religious discrimination claims studies rarely address religious discrimination in the workplace  though claims have more than doubled in the last 20 years  the present studies investigated whether social psychology can help predict perceptions of hostile work environments  hwes  faced by workers on the basis of their religion  that is  the present research examined whether and how self referencing  similarity  and social identity affect how people perceive complainants and harassers in religious hwe cases and if those perceptions affect legal decisions such as whether discrimination occurred  in study 1  evaluators read case summaries of jewish or muslim workers facing workplace religious discrimination  in study 2  evaluators read case summaries focused on the alleged harasser  who was either mormon or evangelical christian  the present studies found that self referenced  subjective assessment as to whether religious discrimination occurred predicted objective legal judgments made after reading jury instructions  in addition  the subjective objective legal judgment relationship was generally stronger when the evaluator and the complainant were perceived as more similar or shared an in group status  overall  these studies demonstrated that the experimental paradigm used to explain self referencing and perceptions of sexual harassment can be applied to religious discrimination claims  and also expanded that paradigm by investigating the roles of perceived similarity and social identity  each played an important role in the legal decision making process and evangelical christian evaluators were especially shown to protect an evangelical christian supervisor accused of harassing a secular employee  implications for handling and reducing the number of religious discrimination incidents in the workplace are discussed

 renegotiating social citizenship in the age of devolution the period 2012 to 2016 saw important developments in the role of the united kingdom s devolved legislatures in shaping the social rights of citizenship  near uniformity in social security is being eroded  with competences devolved to scotland and northern ireland proceeding with limited divergence from great britain  this turn to regionalism is linked with dissatisfaction with british government approaches  this article examines developments from a social citizenship perspective  welfare state regionalism is a challenge to marshall s perceived unitary view of citizenship  yet  it is argued  moves towards divergence are driven by regional differences of perspective on citizens  social rights and reciprocal obligations in a way that emphasizes the continued relevance of marshallian theory  the democratization of political rights gave birth to social rights in the early twentieth century  today  the regionalization of democratic citizenship enables alternative visions for social citizenship to be articulated and begin to shape welfare services at devolved level

 reorienting the process due  using jurisdiction to forge post settlement relationships among litigants  courts  and the public in class and other aggregate litigation the 1966 revision of rule 23 has shaped our political and legal imagination  building on the 1950 ruling of mullane v  central hanover bank and trust company  which approved the possibility of binding absentees nationwide through representative litigation  rule 23 expanded the groups eligible for class treatment  aggregation responded to felt social needs for banks to pool trusts  school students to enforce school desegregation injunctions  and consumers to pursue monetary claims too small to bring individually  key to the legitimacy of doing so for rule 23 s drafters was  the homogeneous character  of claims  permitting an identity of interests between the representative and absent members of the class  the 1966 rule 23 put judges in charge twice  first  to determine the shape of the class and the adequacy of the representation and second  if a compromise was proposed  to assess again whether representative plaintiffs had proffered a fair and adequate resolution  rule 23 gave a limited role to absentees  many of whom were in mandatory classes from which no exit was possible  added on late in the drafting was a mandate to provide notice at the outset that class actions were pending  that notice was required only for a subset of cases  individuals with monetary stakes were given formal opportunities to  opt out  even if  as a practical matter  individual lawsuits were not likely feasible  while not producing a mass of opt outs  notice requirements have pushed the processes of class actions into the public realm  class actions gained a visibility not only because of the stakes and the judicial decisions on certification and settlement but also through mass mailings that brought the idea of class actions into the homes of millions of potential beneficiaries of lawsuits  aspirations and utility thus combined to reframe constitutional understandings of the  process due  by legitimating the authority of courts to deal in the aggregate without individuals affirmatively consenting to participate when cases began  but what fifty years of experience with class actions and related forms of aggregation including multi district litigation  mdl  and bankruptcy have made plain is that an aggregate litigation s life span often continues after settlement or trial  new information can emerge about difficulties in effectuating relief as can conflicts among claimants  whose  homogeneous character  may diminish after resolution  thus  aggregate litigation in practice has come to have three phases certification  resolution by settlement or trial  and implementation of remedies  critics of class actions  aiming to disable their use  rely on problems of implementation to argue against certification at the outset  and they invoke due process rights of both defendants and absent plaintiffs  a new law of due process is also emerging in the arena of personal jurisdiction as the supreme court circumscribes the ability of courts to decide claims involving non resident defendants  i bring that doctrine into discussions of class actions  first because the supreme court expanded the ability to aggregate litigants in 1950 through expanding jurisdiction and second because the court s decisions reflect unease with adjudicative authority not founded on relationships among the forum and those whose rights are decided  the concern about ensuring that defendants are  at home  parallels class action notice  as both seek forms of affiliation between litigants and the jurisdictions deciding their rights  the supreme court has used its new personal jurisdiction law to circumscribe the scope of courts  reach  here i propose to borrow its concerns for the opposite purpose to build affiliations so to expand the authority of courts during aggregation s third phase  aggregation s pooling of resources has new importance today  as tens of thousands of civil litigants appear in state and federal courts without lawyers  revising its practices is one way for democratic polities to help all classes of persons have access to court based remedies  in 1950 in mullane  the supreme court approved what has been called  jurisdiction by necessity  to license state courts to determine the rights of all claimants when lawsuits had a nexus with the forum and notice was provided  in this century  the court should likewise recognize the necessity of giving judges jurisdiction to oversee aggregation post settlement so as to monitor implementation  respond to conflicts  and assess distributional equities  and  just as the 1966 rule drafters turned to notice as a means of doing  something  to connect litigants with courts  notice can again be put to work during aggregation s third phase to provide the  publicity   to borrow from jeremy bentham  that makes connections possible and that forces the practices of courts  lawyers  and auxiliary personnel before the public  
 res interpretata  erga omnes effect and the role of the margin of appreciation in giving domestic effect to the judgments of the european court of human rights this article argues that articles 1  19 and 32 of the european convention on human rights  echr  provide for a principle of res interpretata  which has also been confirmed in the case law of the european court of human rights  ecthr   this engenders a legal obligation under international law for the contracting states to take the full body of the court s case law into account when performing their obligations under the convention  it further argues that the principle of res interpretata is confirmed and operationalized in the ecthr s more recent case law on the margin of appreciation  where the court seeks to facilitate a more direct and timely involvement of its jurisprudence in the legal systems of the contracting states  therefore  while the erga omnes effect for the judgments of the ecthr is not expressly provided by the echr  the principle of res interpretata and the margin of appreciation doctrine de facto translate to introduce such an effect  after analysing the relevant case law and explaining the nuances of the court s different approaches to incentivizing domestic courts  on the one hand  and domestic policymakers  on the other  the article will elaborate on the extent to which the obligations imposed on states through the principle of res interpretata can reach  while pointing out some dangers inherent in the trends analysed  and cautioning the court to be careful not to compromise its role under article 32 of the echr of upholding the interpretation and application of convention rights  the article concludes with a relatively positive assessment of the developments discussed  
 reshaping amnesty in uganda for over 15 years  the state of uganda granted amnesty to thousands of people from various rebel groups through the passing of the amnesty act 2000  this landmark legislation purported to offer a formal promise from the state that recipients of amnesty would not be prosecuted for their participation in armed rebellion  over 13 000 former lord s resistance army  lra  combatants availed themselves of this amnesty  that is  until one lra commander  thomas kwoyelo  aka latoni   was arrested  his application for  and ultimate denial of  the amnesty certificate that was granted to thousands of other lra fighters  has significant consequences for the amnesty project in uganda  in 2015  the supreme court of uganda ruled that kwoyelo was not entitled to amnesty because of the grave nature of the acts he is alleged to have committed  this important ruling significantly departs from the local understanding of amnesty in uganda  what it was  what it covered  and what it protected the recipient from  this article proceeds to examine the creation of the amnesty act  its legislative history  the intricacies of kwoyelo case  and the supreme court judgment itself  ultimately  this article argues that the kwoyelo judgment redefines the prevailing meaning of amnesty  with potentially far reaching social and legal consequences for post conflict uganda  
 responsive regulation in public private partnerships  between deterrence and persuasion design build finance maintain operate  dbfmo  contracts are a particular type of public private partnership whereby governments transfer the responsibility for the design  construction  financing  maintenance  and operation of a public infrastructure or utility service building to a multi headed private consortium through a long term performance contract  these arrangements present a typical principal agent problem because they incorporate a carrot and stick approach in which the agent  consortium  has to fulfill the expectations of the principal  procurer   this article deals with a neglected aspect in the literature related to the actual use of the sticks or sanctions in dbfmos and assesses to what extent and under which conditions contract managers adopt a deterrence based enforcement approach or switch to a persuasion based approach  specifically when the contract clauses require the use of  automatic  deterrence  an empirical analysis of four dbfmos in the netherlands shows that the continuation of service delivery  the need to build trust  and the lack of agreement on output specifications play a role in the willingness of the procurer to apply a more responsive behavior that uses persuasion  even when deterrence should be automatically applied   c  2016 john wiley   sons australia  ltd 
 restricted linking of emissions trading systems  options  benefits  and challenges with over 17 emissions trading systems  etss  now in place across four continents  interest in linking etss is growing  linking etss offers economic  political  and administrative benefits  it also faces major challenges  linking can affect overall ambition  financial flows  and the location and nature of investments  reduces regulatory autonomy  and requires harmonization of ets design elements  this article examines three options that could help overcome challenges by restricting the flow of units among jurisdictions through quotas  exchange rates  or discount rates  we use a simple model and three criteria abatement outcome  economic implications  and feasibility to assess these  restricted linking  options  quotas can enhance cost effectiveness relative to no linking and allow policy makers to retain control on the extent of unit flows  exchange rates can create abatement and economic benefits or unintended adverse implications for cost effectiveness and total abatement  depending on how rates are set  due to information asymmetries between the regulated entities and policy makers setting the exchange rate  as well as uncertainties about future developments  setting exchange rates in a manner that avoids such unintended consequences could prove difficult  discount rates  in contrast  can ensure that both cost effectiveness and total abatement are enhanced  overall  restricted linking options do not achieve the benefits of full linking  but also avoid some major pitfalls  as well as offering levers that can be adjusted  should linking concerns prove to be more significant than anticipated  
 restrictions on the use of force at sea  an environmental protection perspective the restrictions on the use of force at sea exist in different branches of international law  the law of the sea and environmental law  mainly applicable during peacetime  and international humanitarian law  ihl   as the law applicable in times of armed conflict  different rules from these areas must be compared and analyzed to determine the common principles applicable to restricting the use of force at sea for the purposes of environmental protection  taking into account the particular problems of protecting the marine environment in the context of the use of force  the law of the sea and international environmental law should be applied to restrict means and methods of using force at sea during armed conflict  the detailed concepts and approaches in the law of the sea and environmental law may complement ihl  and the precautionary principle of international environmental law should be triggered to address the lacunae in ihl protecting the marine environmental during armed conflict  
 retaliatory arrests and the first amendment  the chilling effects of hartman v  moore on the freedom of speech in the age of civilian vigilance in the age of civilian vigilance  smartphone technology and social media have enabled individuals to record and share videos of police interactions with citizens at an unprecedented rate  sometimes providing indisputable evidence of police misconduct for the world to see instantly  the probative value and public shock factor of some of these videos have also opened the door to retaliatory arrests  in the 2006 case hartman v  moore  the u s  supreme court ruled that a plaintiff must show the absence of probable cause to establish a retaliatory prosecution claim  the court did not hold whether this heightened pleading standard applied to retaliatory arrests  leaving open a circuit split on the issue  i argue that extending the hartman standard to retaliatory arrest claims would create a chilling effect on free speech  particularly in the context of speech opposing or challenging police action  specifically  extending hartman s heightened pleading standard to retaliatory arrest claims would chill speech in two ways   1  it would increase the likelihood of arrests of those who speak out  and  2  it would discourage others from speaking out upon seeing those arrests  these are unacceptable consequences because the freedom of individuals to speak out without the fear of arrest is core to the principles of a free nation  
 rethinking judicial review of arbitration mandatory arbitration is everywhere in the daily life of most americans   when they sign a cell phone contract  buy a cable subscription  or sign up for a checking account  for most americans  there is no avenue to acquire these basic goods and services without giving up the right to litigate disputes before a court of law  the increased use of mandatory arbitration clauses is not an accident  buoyed by the supreme court s expansive interpretation of the federal arbitration act over the last few decades  businesses have used mandatory arbitration clauses to insulate themselves from liability by  for example  including class action waiver provisions in arbitration agreements that can make it financially impossible for plaintiffs to bring substantive claims  a key aspect of the current arbitral system is that arbitrators  decisions are subject to extremely limited judicial review  which is an underlying assumption of both supreme court jurisprudence and scholarship in this area  this note seeks to question that assumption  first  it considers traditional rationales for limited judicial review of arbitral decisions and argues that these justifications fail to take into account the realities of the current arbitral system  second  borrowing from administrative law  it offers a proposal for how states could tailor a system of increased judicial review of arbitration decisions that would better promote fairness while preserving the positive effects of arbitration  
 rethinking subsidy disciplines for the future  policy options for reform subsidies are a critical instrument in the toolbox that governments use to achieve a variety of policy goals  in an increasingly interdependent world  addressing the negative externalities of subsidies while maintaining their market correcting function and the policy space for development is an imperative from a sustainable development perspective  in light of the changes in the global economy and emerging social and environmental concerns  the present article seeks to assess the adequacy of existing international subsidy disciplines and suggest possible areas for improvement and reform  recent steps on agricultural export subsidies in wto at the nairobi ministerial in december 2015  and in the transpacific partnership  tpp  negotiations ending in late 2015 on fisheries subsidies  notably  a result of  soft law  pressures   agricultural export subsidies  and state owned enterprises suggest that progress can be made  three groups of policy options are identified  firstly  revisit international disciplines by creating  under the wto agreement on subsidies and countervailing measures  a narrowly defined category of non actionable subsidies with clear boundaries  as well as a category of subsidies subject to absolute prohibition or a presumption of prohibition  secondly  the procedures for establishing  monitoring  and resolving disputes for the various types of subsidies should be adjusted by strengthening the role of a neutral decision maker while restricting the option for unilateral action  finally  a key consideration in the field of subsidies is that of obtaining better data and measuring impacts  the establishment of an independent platform for data collection using common standards and definitions is recommended  where appropriate  the article seeks to identify gaps in priorities and concerns over subsidy disciplines between advanced and developing economies  inevitably  the article is more of a summary than a treatise  the goal was to spark discussion and thinking  leading eventually to action  
 rethinking the nineteenth century domestication of the sharia  marriage and family in the imaginary of classical legal thought and the genealogy of  muslim  personal law in late colonial india this article situates the personal law  in late colonial india in the nineteenth century genealogy of the idea of family law   in doing so  it also looks at a case between indian muslim spouses before the judge and islamic modernist syed mahmood  involving the doctrine of the restitution of conjugal rights  the case was conducted in the shadow of a question about whether marriage was a status or contract that had a much wider resonance in the late nineteenth century anglo common law world  the overall goal of the article is to critically reconsider a common view about legal modernization in the long nineteenth century islamicate world as a process of domesticating the islamic shara tradition to the sphere of family affairs and personal status  working along a distinct path from other new scholarship that is moving past this thesis  i suggest that domestication should be seen as part of what some have called the globalization of classical legal thought after 1850  because the era of domestication continued to be an important point of reference for later exponents of political islam the article also argues that seeing the categories of personal law and family law genealogically has implications for the problem of translation that has often made scholars reticent about striking an equivalence between islamic law  and shara  or beyond the islamicate world  between modern law  and afro asian juridical tradition   
 rethinking the regulation of environment impact assessment and precaution in mauritius as a small island developing state  mauritius needs to manage its natural assets with a precautionary approach  especially as the tourism industry is one of the main pillars of its economy  while the precautionary principle has no statutory value in mauritius  it serves as a guiding principle in environmental decision making  since 1993  the assessment of impact has been mandatory under the environment protection act  epa  for major development activities  to avoid activities that may have a significant adverse impact on the environment and society  the local impact assessment procedure currently includes two categories of undertakings listed in the epa  namely the environment impact assessment  eia  and the preliminary environment report for undertakings with less environmental and socio economic impact  this article examines the mauritian eia regulatory mechanism and seeks to strengthen the eia process with a precautionary approach  to achieve more effective regulation and implementation  
 rethinking the wrongness constraint on criminalisation orthodox thought holds that criminalisation should be subject to a wrongness constraint  that is  that conduct may be criminalised only if it is wrongful  this article argues that this principle is false  at least as it is usually understood  on the one hand  the wrongness constraint seems to rest on solid foundations  to criminalise conduct is to facilitate its condemnation and punishment  to coerce citizens against it  and to portray it as wrongful  all of these actions are presumptively impermissible when the conduct that they target is not wrongful  on the other hand  the article argues that the wrongness constraint is nevertheless unsound  although it is presumptively impermissible to criminalise non wrongful conduct  this might yet be permissible  given sufficient countervailing reasons  moreover  there are realistic cases   specifically  some cases of over inclusive criminalisation   in which such countervailing reasons exist  
 rethinking water governance  moving beyond water centric perspectives in a connected and changing world from the  water centric  perspective that is common within the world s large and diverse water community  water is of central importance  and improving water governance is self evidently essential  some water problems can be addressed using water centric approaches such as watershed management  unfortunately  evidence is mounting that suggests that many other water problems cannot because their causes and drivers  at scales from local to global  are partly or wholly external to those traditionally considered within the water sector  water governance in these cases needs to better account for a range of external connections that strongly influence water related outcomes of concern and contribute to governance failures  these connections frequently manifest through external actors  drivers  and institutions  we address this issue by critically reflecting on the limitations of water centric perspectives  surveying the water governance literature to identify external connections that can influence water governance  examining the extent to which four major approaches address actors  drivers  and institutions that connect water governance to other sectors and decision making situations  integrated water resources management  water security  water energy food nexus  water resilience   and considering key conceptual and practical challenges of moving beyond water centric approaches where this is warranted  building on emerging thinking within the water community  we propose that key open questions requiring urgent attention relate to reconciling water centric and non water centric approaches  thinking critically about boundary judgments  and re thinking conceptual and practical approaches to water governance to better account for external connections  the article contributes to emerging conversations about the future of water governance in an increasingly complex  connected and rapidly changing world  
 retooling and coordinating the approach to prosecutorial misconduct prosecutorial misconduct has stubbornly remained a troubling feature of the american criminal justice system  judges and scholars have bemoaned its persistence  and some have warned that it threatens to reach epidemic proportions  the problem is that the current approaches we deploy to surface  investigate  and stop such misconduct are inadequate to the task  too often  the courts  scholars  and the public misread the scope of the problem  they want to treat responses to prosecutorial misconduct as a product of individual bad actors  these individual  bad apples  are viewed as outliers and disconnected from office leadership  but the misconduct is rarely just an individual failure and more often encompasses an array of key players throughout the prosecutor s office  prosecutorial misconduct flows from an environment that tolerates it  oversees it  and encourages it  so  rooting out the problem of misconduct necessarily involves more than weeding out a few bad individuals  it requires new ways of defining the conduct and coordination of the responses to capture the scope of this misconduct  this article explores the dimensions of prosecutorial misconduct and challenges the prevailing notion that misconduct is a singular act by a corrupt individual  it contends  instead  that the chronic increase in instances of prosecutorial misbehavior stems from our failure to understand the scope and frequency of misconduct coupled with our tendency to minimize or cover up the behavior of prosecutors  this article proposes treating misconduct as obstruction of justice as a preliminary step toward recognizing and signaling the gravity of the stakes involved  it then calls for better coordination  more thorough data gathering  and more focused state and federal intervention to investigate and deter misconduct  
 reversing a withdrawal notification under article 50 teu  can a member state change its mind  the purpose of this article is to determine whether a member state of the eu may revoke its notice to withdraw from the union under art 50 teu  the answer to this question has significant practical implications for brexit  both domestically and across europe  the present article suggests that interpreting art 50 teu with reference to art 31 and art 32 of the vienna convention on the law of treaties permits a more systematic analysis of the subject than what has been offered so far by commentators and the english courts  based on this analytical framework  the article confirms that a notice to withdraw issued under art 50 teu is in fact reversible  contrary to the position taken by the english courts in miller

 revised practical guidance for first responders managing the dead after disasters the proper and dignified management of the dead is one of the three pillars of the humanitarian response to disasters  along with the rescue and care of survivors and the provision of essential services  first launched in 2006  the widely used publication management of dead bodies after disasters  a field manual for first responders offers practical and easy to follow guidelines  it has become the go to guide not only for non experts confronted with dead bodies in the aftermath of a catastrophe  but also for those responsible for disaster planning and preparedness in countries with well developed forensic services  ten years after the publication of the 2006 manual  a revised edition has been released  the inclusion of a decade of experience in its field implementation  as well as the incorporation of recent scientific developments in mass fatality management  makes the revised manual an invaluable resource for first responders confronted with the realities of dead body management following a disaster  
 revisionism as a logic of institutional change how does a treaty based organisation account for its shifts in policy and procedure  with the european union s history in focus  the paper observes a pattern of evolution by which departures from existing practice are justified as moves to better honour commitments already held  this logic of change as fidelity has long been the usual way of doing transnational politics in post war europe  the concept of revisionism  borrowed from the study of innovation in purposive organisations more generally  elucidates its place in the early european community  the paper goes on to examine how more recent developments  especially visible in the euro crisis  challenge this logic of change and threaten to displace it  it concludes by discussing what this implies for the political nature of the eu  and whether the revival of the revisionist method is plausible or desirable  
 revisiting the  interests of justice  policy paper the prosecutor of the international criminal court  icc  is empowered with a unique discretionary tool to forego an investigation or prosecution in  the interests of justice   taking into consideration the gravity of the crime and the interests of victims  the 2007 policy paper on the  interests of justice  emphasizes that the exercise of the prosecutor s discretion under article 53 1  c  and 53 2  c  icc statute is exceptional in its nature  and that there is a presumption in favour of investigation or prosecution  a contention embraced by the majority of scholars and ngos  contrary to this background  this contribution aims to emphasize the inherently pluralistic elastic nature of the expression  highlighting the need for revision of the policy paper in order to address the never ending quest for legitimacy  
 revisiting the legal nature of  un signing  an unratified treaty  broader implications of the us  withdrawal from the tpp this article focuses on the legal issues arising from treaty withdrawal after signing but before ratification  as is the case in the united states  hereinafter  u s    withdrawal from the trans pacific partnership agreement  hereinafter  tpp    this article attempts to shed light on the definition of  withdrawal   or  un signing   because it can make a practical difference to the fate of the tpp  more specifically  we consider the legal nature of the u s  withdrawal and its broader implications for the other signatories  first  is the u s  still acting within the framework of the tpp or is it already out  second  what impact does this u s  action have on the legal status of the other original signatories of the tpp  third  is the u s  liable for violating its obligation to not frustrate the object and purpose of the treaty at hand  finally  what can the 11 original signatories learn from the exit of the u s  to revive the tpp without u s  involvement  our major arguments are that the u s  still remains an original signatory to the tpp  despite its notorious notification of withdrawal in january 2017  on the other hand  other original signatories that have already ratified are not exempt from the interim obligation of not frustrating the object and purpose based solely on  undue delay  caused by the u s  s unilateral notification of withdrawal  in addition  other original signatories are not eligible to claim damages against the u s  due to their acquiescence  and the u s  cannot claim damages for the subsequent actions of other original signatories because the current situation was created by the u s  itself finally  the other original signatories have several options to avoid a similar incident in the future  
 revisiting the public safety exception to miranda for suspected terrorists  dzhoichar tsarnaev and the bombing of the 2013 boston marathon this comment examines the application of the public safety exception to miranda to cases of domestic terrorism  looking particularly at the case of dzhokhar tsarnaev and the 2013 boston marathon bombing  by comparing the department of justice s war on terror policies to the warren court s rationale for miranda  this comment argues that courts should require law enforcement officers to have reasonable knowledge of an immediate threat to public safety before they may properly invoke the quarles public safety exception  
 rights  damage and loss this article is an exploration of the relationship between the concepts of rights  damage and loss  the focus of the analysis is on the law of negligence  though some of the claims have wider ramifications  the article is divided into three main sections  first  on the relationship between rights and damage  second  on the relationship between rights and loss  and third  on the relationship between damage and loss  in each section  a separate  but related  claim is made   i  that a concept of damage is a necessary component of a plausible rights based conception of negligence law   ii  that a right not to suffer loss is conceptually impossible  and  iii  that damage and loss are fundamentally different concepts

 ropes of sand  state antitrust statutes bound by their original scope many state antitrust statutes passed around the turn of the twentieth century contain language that ostensibly limits their jurisdiction to their state s borders  courts typically equate this language  as well as the jurisdictional limits of some early antitrust statutes without explicit limits  to the dormant commerce clause boundaries present during these statutes  enactment  however  courts disagree considerably on the historical limits of state antitrust jurisdiction and thus  promulgate a variety of standards that purportedly limit state antitrust statutes to their original scope  this note argues that these standards  which focus on the goods  transactions  or effects related to trade restraints  are ill suited for determining the original scope of these statutes  when analyzing state antitrust statutes  early courts frequently held that the fate of state enforcement turned on whether the restraint itself crossed state borders  even when it exclusively affected interstate transactions  accordingly  this note argues that modern courts should adopt a  restraint focused  standard as a more historically faithful approach to understanding the scope of early antitrust statutes  
 rule 24 notwithstanding  why article iii should not limit intervention of right the supreme court recently decided in town of chester v  laroe estates  inc  that intervenors of right under federal rule of civil procedure 24 a   2  must demonstrate independent article iii standing when they pursue relief different from that requested by an original plaintiff  this decision resolved  in part  a decades long controversy among the courts of appeals over the proper relationship between rule 24 intervention and article iii standing that the court first acknowledged in diamond v  charles  but the court s narrow decision in town of chester hardly disposed of the controversy  and courts of appeals are still free to require standing of defendant intervenors and  it stands to reason  plaintiff intervenors even if they do not pursue different relief  with this debate yet unresolved  this note takes a less conventional approach  in addition to arguing that the supreme court s precedents implicitly resolved this question before town of chester  this note argues that the nature of judicial decisions raises two concerns that a liberal application of rule 24 a   2  would mitigate  first  this note argues that stare decisis limits the right of litigants to be heard on the merits of their claims and defenses in a way that undermines the principles of due process  second  this note argues that the process of judicial decisionmaking is fraught with potential epistemic problems that can produce suboptimal legal rules  after considering these two concerns  this note argues that rule 24 a   2  is a better and more practical way to mitigate these problems than are rule 24 a  2  s alternatives  
 rules and values in virtual optimization of california hydropower optimization models for california s hydropower system are designed to be decision support tools and aids for climate adaptation decision making  in practice  they fall short of this goal  one potential explanation is that optimization models are not more successful because they are built on  and depend on  a misrepresentation of law and politics  the legal reality of california s hydropower system is a web of networked jurisdictions of multiple federal and state agencies  with varying levels of coordination  long periods of legally obligated stability with rigid rules  and prone to conflict  but with multiple procedures for conflict resolution  barriers to climate adaptation from that mix vary according to where a given dam is located  the virtual institutional arrangements represented in optimization models are not a simplification of existing arrangements  instead  they are a dramatic replacement  that replacement is deliberate and reasoned  as seen in two optimization models supported by the state of california  calvin and inform  the operation of the optimization function of computer models depends on a virtual system of rules that are centrally controlled  coordinated  nimble  and without the possibility of conflict  let alone conflict resolution   but that smooth virtual system comes with a real cost  institutional economics suggests that this mismatch between existing formal law and represented law may upend the results of models  since value is determined from institutional context  
 sacred spaces  sacred words  religion and same sex marriage in england and wales this article provides an analysis of the ways in which the spatial and illocutionary requirements of english marriage law which regulate the spaces in which marriages may be solemnized and the words the parties being married must speak have been used to maintain distinctions between same sex and opposite sex couples  it shows how religious opponents of same sex partnership recognition have relied upon historically entrenched differences between the spatial and illocutionary aspects of  civil marriage  and  religious marriage  to argue in favour of the enactment of law that enables organized religions to exclude same sex couples from religious premises and ceremonies that are open to opposite sex couples for the purpose of solemnizing marriage  it extends recent international debates about how faith based discrimination against same sex couples is accommodated by legislators and legitimized by law  and concludes with a consideration of how english law could be amended to end discrimination based on sexual orientation

 saving the brent benchmark the price of brent crude oil has been a widely used but seriously flawed benchmark since its inception in the early 1980s  declining production of the crude streams that make up brent and the small and ever diminishing number of physical transactions in these crude oils have compelled repeated expansions of brent s definition  towards the end of 2017  troll crude oil will be added in a further effort to prolong the life of the benchmark  this article explains the many difficulties brent has faced  and proposes a clear way to resolve the difficulties permanently  however  the article also describes the unwillingness of most players in the oil market to take the initiative to implement a fundamental revision  the article urges the international organization of security commissions to establish a committee to oversee the health of brent and to ensure the long term future of the benchmark  
 saving title ix  designing more equitable and efficient investigation procedures in 2011  the department of education s office of civil rights  ocr  issued guidance on title ix compliance  this guidance has resulted in the creation of investigative and adjudicatory tribunals at colleges and universities receiving federal funds to hear claims of sexual assault  harassment  and violence  ocr s enforcement efforts are a laudable response to an epidemic of sexual violence on college campuses  but they have faced criticism from administrators  law professors  and potential members of the trump administration  this note suggests ways to alter current title ix enforcement mechanisms to placate critics and to maintain ocr enforcement as a bulwark against sexual violence on college campuses  
 searching for prohibited items in mental health hospitals  a randomised controlled trial of two metal detecting technologies weapons and other items with potential to cause harm are usually prohibited in mental health hospitals and other psychiatric facilities  detecting such prohibited items  pis  can be problematic  particularly if concealed  and metal detectors are commonly used to search for such items  our study compared two types of metal detection  continuous wave detection  cwd  by hand held metal detector  hhmd  and magnetic anomaly detection  mad  by a static pole device  in the study  real and dummy pis were hidden on test subjects and in a simulated body cavity  the results showed mad to be significantly superior to cwd in detecting small concealed pis containing ferrous metal  the mad pole found 100  of the real pis on the test subjects and in the simulated body cavity  the cwd hhmd found only 5 2  of the real pis  and these were limited to those on the test subjects  as it detected none in the simulated body cavity  in addition  the time taken to search by mad pole was shorter than time taken to search by cwd hhmd  
 searching for the common law  the quantitative approach of the restatement of consumer contracts in 2012  the american law institute asked us to serve as reporters for a new restatement of consumer contracts  recognizing that many innovations in american contract law in the past generation occurred in the area of consumer transactions  the project seemed timely and challenging  we discovered that many of these innovations are controversial and seemingly subject to conflicting approaches in the case law and heated debates among commentators  we also discovered that prior attempts to devise a unified set of rules have largely failed  we therefore decided to take a new approach to our search for  and restatement of  the emerging rules  in addition to identifying the majority rules  we used an empirical approach that involved collecting  coding  and systematically analyzing the entire body of court decisions on relevant questions  we identified the degree of support that different rules garnered in courts and the rate at which they were adopted or rejected over time  we thus discovered which rulings and rationales serve as guiding precedent  we based the blackletter rules in the final draft of the restatement of consumer contracts on these findings  complementing them with qualitative support   in this essay  we present our empirical approach to searching for the law and legal precedent  discuss its conceptual and normative foundations  and describe some of the doctrinal debates it helped resolve  
 secondary use of personal data  a welfare analysis the european commission is currently overhauling the most important instrument for the regulation of cross border flows of personal data  the data protection directive of 1995  directive 95 46 ec   among the most tedious legal issues is the use of personal data for secondary purposes  such use occurs if data collected for one purpose  such as credit granting  are later used for another purpose  e g  insurance contracting   while secondary purposes are regulated under the current regime  the implementation across european countries differs  i analyze these differences and discuss cases from germany  ireland and the netherlands  moreover  using theory it is analyzed what type of regulatory regime could be welfare enhancing for consumers

 security sovereignty and the preemption of low risk detainees  a look into tattlelab  torture techniques used at guantanamo bay this study conceptualizes a new sovereign power following controversial interrogation practices used at guantanamo bay  i conceptualize this new sovereign  referred to as security sovereignty  as a new style of governance that draws commonalities and differences with logics of security and sovereignty  while security logics aim to preempt future danger and sovereignty seeks to violently retaliate against those that break the law  security sovereignty uses violent measures against low level risks that have not been charged or convicted of wrongdoing  this new concept can be used to help explain why high ranking officials in the bush administration authorized controversial interrogation methods against low value detainees at guantanamo bay and cia black sites  indeed  president bush and high ranking officials at guantanamo bay created a secret interrogation program at guantanamo bay  referred to as  battlelab  interrogations by major general michael dunlavey  to develop the most sophisticated psychological and physical torture techniques  battlelab experimentation techniques were used on select detainees to develop useful truth extraction methods that could later be used on high value targets captured on the battlefield  such practices included severe sleep deprivation  the use of psychosis inducing drugs  forced enemas and medications  and prolonged iv feedings that resulted in involuntary bowel movements  this study uses battlelab experimentations as substantive support to theorize a new sovereign power that exercises the absolute right to torture detainees that do not pose a threat to u s  national security   c  2017 elsevier ltd  all rights reserved  
 seeing red  disgust reactions to gruesome photographs in color  but not in black and white  increase convictions jurors are often exposed to emotionally disturbing gruesome photographs of victims of extreme violence  judges must determine whether the informational value of these photographs outweighs their prejudicial effect on jurors and are left to their assumptions about juror psychology to do so  the current research draws upon the affect infusion model  aim  forgas  1995  to investigate the affective mechanism through which gruesome photographs might operate  a mock jury experiment presented online adults  n   193  with murder trial evidence that included verbal descriptions of the victim s injuries and neutral photographs in all conditions  participants were randomly assigned to view  a  only the nongruesome photographs or additional gruesome photographs of the victim in  b  color  or  c  black and white  b w   color gruesome  vs  nongruesome  photographs increased convictions via the disgust they elicited  consistent with the aim  this was especially so for mock jurors with relatively higher awareness of their bodily sensations  the effects of gruesome photographs in color on disgust and verdicts were eliminated  however  when the same photographs were presented in b w  a second experiment  n   354  replicated these results and also revealed that viewing color gruesome photographs significantly reduced mock jurors  sensitivity to a manipulation of defense evidence strength especially among jurors with relatively higher bodily awareness  thus  gruesome photographs can increase convictions via direct and indirect affect infusion  presenting gruesome photographs in b w might reduce jurors  emotional reactions while maintaining their probative information  
 seeking certainty  judicial approaches to the  non  treatment of minimally conscious patients a modest  but growing  body of case law is developing around the  non  treatment of patients in the minimally conscious state  we sought to explore the approaches that the courts take to these decisions  using the results of a qualitative analysis  we identify five key features of the rulings to date  first  the judges appear keen to frame the cases in such a way that these are rightly matters for judicial determination  secondly  the judges appraise the types and forms of expertise that enter the courtroom  seeming to prefer the  objective  and  scientific   and particularly the views of the doctors  thirdly  the judges appear alert to the reasonableness of the evidence  and  indeed  the parties  and will look favourably on parties who are willing to co operate  but the judges will not simply endorse any consensus reached by the parties  rather  the judges will reach their own decisions  those decisions must be taken in the best interests of the patient  fourthly  the judges approach this assessment in different ways  a balancing exercise is not consistently undertaken and  even in those cases in which it is  the weight accorded to particular factors varies  as we discuss  the consistency and predictability of the law in this area is open to question  finally  however  we cautiously suggest that some consistent messages do begin to emerge  the courts  apparent preference for certainty in diagnosis and prognosis provide pointers for how cases might be decided  
 seeking shelter in personal insolvency law  recession  eviction  and bankruptcy s social safety net many legal systems understand consumer insolvency laws as social insurance  providing relief and a  fresh start  to over indebted households who fall through gaps in the social safety net  personal insolvency law in england and wales in practice functions similarly  but in terms of legal principle and policy is ambivalent   sometimes emphasizing household debt relief other times creditor wealth maximization  this article assesses  in the context of novel debt problems brought to prominence by recession and austerity  the extent to which the law has embraced personal insolvency s social insurance function  the discussion is framed particularly by the escalating united kingdom housing crisis and the case of places for people v  sharpies concerning consumer bankruptcy s  non protection of debtors from eviction  the analysis illustrates how tensions between conceptual understandings and personal insolvency law s practical operation undermine the law s ability to fulfil its potential to produce positive policy responses to contemporary socio economic challenges  
 self help  reimagined we will never have enough lawyers to serve the civil legal needs of all low  and moderate income  lmi  individuals who must navigate civil legal problems  a significant part of the access to justice toolkit must include self help materials  that much is not new  indeed  the legal aid community has been actively developing pro se guides and forms for decades  but the community has hamstrung its creations in two major ways  first  by focusing these materials almost exclusively on educating lmi individuals about formal law  and second  by considering the task complete once the materials have been made available to self represented individuals  in particular  modern self help materials fail to address many psychological and cognitive barriers that prevent lmi individuals from successfully deploying the substance of the materials  in this article we make two contributions  first  we develop a theory of the obstacles lmi individuals face when attempting to deploy professional legal knowledge  second  we apply learning from fields as varied as psychology  public health  education  artificial intelligence  and marketing to develop a framework for how courts  legal aid organizations  law school clinics  and others might reconceptualize the design and delivery of civil legal materials for unrepresented individuals  we illustrate our framework with examples of reimagined civil legal materials  
 semantics or sustainability  socio legal research in family law  or sociology of law and family justice this article first addresses the question of semantics in the rapidly developing field of law and society in the united kingdom  and suggests that the various terminologies  sociology of law  socio legal studies  empirical legal studies  and more  indicate lively development rather than confusion  and should be a source of congratulation not concern  the second part of the article takes the development of the study of family justice as an example in addressing the issue of sustainability through methodological development and methods of communication which may provide the key to an ongoing contribution to the understanding of law in society  
 sexual misconduct in prison  what factors affect whether incarcerated women will report abuses committed by prison staff  more than 80 000 prisoners each year are sexually victimized during incarceration  but only about 8  report victimization to correctional authorities  complicating reporting is the fact that half of the perpetrators are staff members  given the restrictive and highly regulated prison environment  studies that examine reporting behaviors are difficult to conduct and to date information available relied on those who have reported or hypothetical victimization studies  this study uses an ecological framework and archival data from a class action lawsuit of sexual misconduct to determine predictors of reporting  relying on a subsample of 179 women  chosen because they have all experienced at least 1 penetration offense  we use bivariate and multivariable mixed effects logistic regression analyses to examine individual  assault  and context level predictors of reporting on 397 incidents of staff sexual misconduct  the final model revealed that that 6 predictors  age at time of assault  physical injury  multiple incidents  perpetrator with multiple victims  the year the abuse began  and the number of years women have left on their sentence  account for 58  of the variance in reporting  disclosure to inmate peers and or family and friends was significant in the bivariate results  these findings indicate the need for stronger and more systematic implementation of prison rape elimination act guidelines and remedies that create and enforce sanctions  including termination  for staff violating policy and state law  
 shape shifters  searching for the copyright work in kinetic living art in kelley v  chicago park district  the seventh circuit held that the changeable nature of a living wildflower garden meant it lacked sufficient  stable fixation  to be a copyright work  this article challenges that conclusion  explaining how the court incorrectly distorted the statutory definition of fixation  it argues that a more persuasive explanation for kelley is an assumption that gardens are fundamentally precluded from being a copyright  work   this article interrogates that assumption  it closely probes the meaning  boundaries  and importance of the  work  in copyright  and the difficulties in defining it  in doing so  the article expands nascent  but growing  scholarship on the copyright work itself as a discrete area of enquiry  the definition of the copyright work is elusive  and it is suggested that it may only be possible to define it as the intellectual conception of an author that emerges from copyright s exclusionary filtration process  however  the article identifies other pressures that contain the copyright work  it argues that works must also be identifiable  a condition problematized by kinetic creations  and it notes that a persistence in conflating the work and copyright s enumerated subject matter has the practical effect of binding the work to those listed items  the article then considers the broader implications of kelley for copyright in kinetic contemporary art  particularly when that kinesis is generated by living elements  the article argues that copyright works can be kinetic  and that kinetic works can be fixed  provided the work is identifiable in the changeable creation  it then investigates some of the broader practical and policy ramifications flowing from conferring copyright on gardens and other creations incorporating elements of living kinesis  and explains how the theoretical possibility of copyright  and moral rights  in gardens is probably eclipsed by a number of practical obstacles  all of which are ultimately founded on an anxiety about enclosing and maintaining certainty in subject matter  
 sharing is daring  an experiment on consent  chilling effects and a salient privacy nudge privacy law rests on the assumption that government surveillance may increase the general level of conformity and thus generate a chilling effect  in a study that combines elements of a lab and a field experiment  we show that salient and incentivized consent options are sufficient to trigger this behavioral effect  salient ex ante consent options may lure people into giving up their privacy and increase their compliance with social norms   even when the only immediate risk of sharing information is mere publicity on a google website  a right to be forgotten  right to deletion   however  seems to reduce neither privacy valuations nor chilling effects  in spite of low deletion costs people tend to stick with a retention default  the study suggests that consent architectures may play out on social conformity rather than on consent choices and privacy valuations  salient notice and consent options may not merely empower users to make an informed consent decision  instead  they can trigger the very effects that privacy law intends to curb   c  2017 elsevier inc  all rights reserved  
 sherman vs  goliath   tackling the conglomerate dominance problem in emerging and small economies hong kong as a case study this article explores a competition problem that has been long neglected in the two major competition law jurisdictions  the united states and the european union  conglomerate dominance or aggregate concentration  with their continental scale  the u  s  or the eu economies are unlikely to be dominated by conglomerates  however  conglomerates have been found to be common in small economies and emerging economies  conglomerates no doubt have their advantages  yet they also pose some serious economic power issues and distort competition in a variety of ways  the latter of which has been relatively unexplored in the literature  this article catalogs these issues and distortions and proposes two sets of responses to them  direct regulation of conglomerates and competition law enforcement  these two sets of solutions to some extent alleviate the detrimental effects of conglomerates  however  they do not get to the root of the problem  domination of an economy by large conglomerates  using hong kong as an example  this article illustrates the application of these two sets of solutions and their limitations  
 shielded from justice  how state attorneys general can provide structural remedies to the criminal prosecutions of police officers the recent string of police shootings involving unarmed civilians has prompted national outcry over the actions of law enforcement officials  many state and local law enforcement agencies today are reexamining the way prosecutors handle these incidents  in most jurisdictions today  district attorneys are responsible for investigating such cases  which is problematic given the reciprocal relationship that exists between district attorneys and law enforcement agencies  specifically  district attorneys rely on police officers to make arrests  interrogate suspects and testify at trial  in turn  police officers rely on district attorneys to translate their arrests into convictions  this relationship creates a real or perceived conflict of interest  which can severely undermine public confidence in the criminal justice system  state attorneys general  however  may provide structural solutions to this problem  to illustrate this  this note conducts a broad survey of the five major categories of actions that state attorneys general can use during investigations into police shootings  this note also offers recommendations as to how state attorneys general can improve on current practices to ensure fair investigations and outcomes  recommendations include appointing a special prosecutor from a different district  launching a conflict of interest inquiry  cooperating with the federal government in devising a national database of police shootings  and reexamining the legal parameters of the use of force  
 shifting sands  consent  context and vulnerability in contemporary sexual offences policy in england and wales although the consent threshold remains fundamental to the demarcation of acceptable from unacceptable forms of behaviour within contemporary sexual offences law and policy  there has clearly been a shift in recent years in england and wales towards more contextual  understandings and interpretations thereof  in many respects  this is a welcome development  which has the potential to at least partially redress the problematic assumption of a disembodied  individualistic and self determining chooser  which critics maintain has underpinned many conventional  liberal  accounts of autonomy  at the same time  however  there are risks associated with this turn to context that require vigilance  more specifically  this shift has opened the door to greater reliance upon the often closely associated concepts of vulnerability and exploitation  in this article  i will argue that  while these concepts can be valuable in highlighting and challenging the constraining conditions under which  sexual  choices may be made  they can also be deployed in the service of moral and political interventions that entrench precariousness in the name of protection and or increase surveillance in pursuit of responsibilization  to assess their impact  therefore  it is necessary to explore the concrete implications of this turn for those most immediately involved  in the following discussion  i will do so first by highlighting some of its perhaps unintended  but certainly undesirable  effects in the specific contexts of sexual assault and sex work policy  having done so  i will move on to explore what we might learn more broadly from this experience about the benefits  blind spots and backfire in using vulnerability as a lens and lever for the pursuit of social justice  
 should chimpanzees have standing  the case for pursuing legal personhood for non human animals examples abound of national and international legal developments that indicate growing concern and respect for animals  however  a key barrier remains  animals are not recognized as legal persons and therefore do not have standing to pursue independent legal action  this significantly limits the scope for legal redress when animals  interests are harmed  this article examines recent attempts in the united states and europe to establish standing for animals via strategic litigation and the barriers that have so far undermined this project  the article argues that  despite their lack of success to date  cases that seek to establish standing for animals should continue to be pursued  societal views about the value of animals  lives are continually evolving such that these cases may soon be successful  furthermore  even if unsuccessful  these cases help in creating the socio cultural space required to redefine the human animal divide and potentially transform animals into rights bearers  
 sino foreign recognition and enforcement of judgments  a promising  follow suit  model  due to the upsurge in cross border transaction  the movement of judgments between jurisdictions has become a hot topic  unfortunately  china s legislation and practice in this area has long lagged behind that of other countries  though china is not the only party to blame for the lack of a favourable sino foreign recognition mechanism  encouragingly  in recent years some foreign courts have taken the initiative to recognize chinese judgments  which chinese courts have then responded to positively  forming a  follow suit  circle in practice  a new opportunity has thus arrived for promoting sino foreign judgment recognition  and both chinese and foreign courts should seize it  as it appears to be the most efficient and practical among possible solutions  including future domestic legislation or international treaties  
 sitting duck or scaredy cat  effects of shot execution strategy on anxiety and police officers  shooting performance under high threat purposelaw enforcement may require police officers to inhibit intuitive responses to high threat and thereby affect their emotional reaction and operational effectiveness  upon this premise  the current study reports two experiments which compare the impact of two relevant shot execution strategies on police officers  shooting performance under high threat  including  1  fire at an armed assailant and then step away from the assailant s line of fire  fire step   or  2  step away from the assailant s line of fire and then fire  step fire    methodin experiment 1  15 experienced police officers performed both shot execution strategies against a stationary assailant who occasionally shot back with coloured soap cartridges  high threat   while we measured their state anxiety  movement times and shot accuracy  in experiment 2  the same 15 officers remained stationary and fired at the assailant who now performed both shot execution strategies in random order  thereby providing an indication of the risk  i e   chance to get hit  associated with performing either strategy  resultsexperiment 1 showed that officers preferred using the step fire strategy and that using this strategy resulted in lower levels of anxiety  increased time for aiming and more accurate shooting than the fire step strategy  experiment 2  however  indicated that the step fire strategy also increases one s chance of getting hit  conclusionsfindings suggest that inhibition of preferred responses under high threat  as in the fire step strategy  may increase state anxiety and negatively affect shooting performance in police officers  future work is needed to reveal underlying mechanisms and explore implications for practice

 small and smart  the role of switzerland in the cartagena and nagoya protocols negotiations this paper looks at switzerland to examine the role of a small state during the negotiations of the cartagena and the nagoya protocols to the convention on biological diversity  the influence of this small country was substantial at some point in the negotiation processes and on important features of the protocols  the main explanatory factors for this influence are identified as the competence and the tactical skills of the swiss delegations as well as the flexible and timely mandates they received  this was reinforced by the way the position formation process was organized at the domestic level  namely a lead ministry strongly committed to the process and an efficient coordination between domestic actors  including the delegations  the swiss delegations were thus able to support the progress of the negotiations  and in parallel to secure some of their interest  by assuming entrepreneurial and intellectual leadership strategies in function of the evolution of domestic and international constraints and opportunities  
 social rights and the function of employing entities in the concept of the employer  2015   jeremias prassl develops an elegant model for finding who bears labour and employment law duties  it offers a logical complement to the multi factor test for determining who is an  employee   this is meant to ensure the effectiveness of social rights in employment  particularly where modern economic arrangements have outpaced legal analysis  this review article summarises prassl s essential argument  that an employing entity exists if it exercises any of a number of functions  such as starting and ending a contract  receiving the  fruits  of labour  providing work and pay  or managing the internal or external enterprise  it then examines prassl s three contexts for its application   i  subcontracting or agency work   ii  private equity  and  iii  corporate groups  overall  prassl s theory is consistent with the purposive approach to an employment relation  authoritatively required by autoclenz ltd v belcher  and the modern theory of enterprise risk and responsibility  it represents a valuable advance of the global discussion on social rights and the function of employing entities  
 sociocultural context and application of criteria for capacity to marry we write to comment on the contribution of glezer and devido  which we found to be a cogent synopsis of the extant scholarship on the capacity to marry  the article raises several important matters that merit further consideration  in this commentary  we expand the discussion  emphasizing cultural and regional contexts  we submit that this is an important policy area  given the lack of capacity criteria for marriage both domestically and internationally  
 soldiers as victims at the eccc  exploring the concept of  civilian  in crimes against humanity the inspiration for this article came from a call for amicus curiae briefs issued in april 2016 by the office of the co investigating judges in the extraordinary chambers in the courts of cambodia  eccc   the call sought guidance on  whether  under customary international law applicable between 1975 and 1979  an attack by a state or organization against members of its own armed forces may amount to an attack directed against a civilian population for the purpose of constituting a crime against humanity under article 5 of the eccc law  we argue that customary international law justifies a finding that an attack on members of the armed forces can constitute crimes against humanity  in particular  the article focuses on the importance placed on the persecution element of crimes against humanity in the post second world war jurisprudence  and the broad interpretation of the term  civilian   the article also examines the jurisprudence of contemporary international courts  finding that in some cases the courts have interpreted the term  civilian  as incorporating hors de combat  however  the international criminal tribunal for the former yugoslavia  icty  and international criminal court  icc  have moved towards a more restrictive interpretation of the term  civilian   potentially excluding members of the armed forces  we argue that this move is regressive  and against the spirit in which the offence of crimes against humanity was created  the eccc has an opportunity to counter this restrictive approach  thereby narrowing the protection gap which crimes against humanity were initially created to close  
 some misunderstandings about legislation and law what is legislation  what is law  a great deal of ink has been spilled on these questions  in this essay i wish to investigate the answers that have been provided in international law  two theses are advanced  first  there is a misunderstanding in international law about what legislation is  it is mistakenly thought that legislation is general  this misunderstanding can  for instance  be discerned in the popular claim that the united nations security council has begun to  legislate  on the international plane  the second thesis attempts to specify how this misunderstanding has come about  in international law writing one commonly finds a more basic mistake about what law is namely  the mistaken view that law is general  if these two theses are true  the literature on international law making stands in need of revision  
 someone else s deal  interpreting international investment agreements in the light of third party agreements this article considers whether an international investment agreement  iia  between two states parties can be interpreted in the light of a  third party iia   defined as a party s iia with a third state  a party s model iia or an iia between other states parties   a significant number of tribunals have been willing to interpret the iia before them with reference to third party iias  drawing inferences from differences or similarities in their texts  however  the use of third party iias in this manner often reflects an erroneous application of the customary rules of treaty interpretation set out in articles 31 33 of the vienna convention on the law of treaties  vclt   these conclusions have significant implications for international investment law and state practice  if investment tribunals continue to look to third party iias beyond the parameters of the vclt  beyond consent of the disputing parties and beyond the common intention of treaty parties  contemporary developments in treaty drafting may have unintended or even perverse consequences  
 somewhere between rhetoric and reality  environmental constitutionalism and the rights of nature in ecuador today  numerous constitutions provide for a rights based approach to environmental protection  based as they are on an instrumentalist rationality that seeks to promote human entitlements to nature  the majority of these rights remain anthropocentric  although there are growing calls within academic and activist circles to reorient rights alongside an ecocentric ontology  only one country to date has taken the bold step to bestow rights on nature in its constitution  the ecuadorian constitution of 2008 announces the transition from a juridical anthropocentric orientation to an ecocentric position by recognizing enforceable rights of nature  this article critically reflects on the legal significance of granting rights to nature  with specific reference to ecuador s constitutional experiment  it first provides a contextual description of rights in an attempt to illustrate their anthropogenic genesis  and then explores the notion of environmental rights  the following part traces the discourse that has developed over the years in relation to the rights of nature by revealing aspects of an ecocentric counter narrative  the final part focuses specifically on the ecuadorian constitutional regime and provides  i  a historical contextual discussion of the events that led to the adoption of the rights of nature   ii  an analysis of the constitutional provisions directly and indirectly related to the rights of nature  and  iii  a critical appraisal of whether those provisions  so far  measure up to the rhetoric of constitutional ecocentric rights of nature in that country  
 sovereignty as autonomy many philosophers  past and present  have attempted to eradicate the notion of sovereignty  the most interesting and most ambitious attempt to do so  comes from those philosophers who claim that sovereignty is in principle incompatible with the rule of law  the purpose of this paper is to repel this latter attack  in order to do so  i investigate the analogy between sovereignty and individual autonomy  the resulting conception of sovereignty   sovereignty as autonomy   shows that sovereignty and the rule of law are utterly compatible  at the same time  this conception conserves what i believe to be the normative core of our modern notion of sovereignty  when speaking of sovereignty  we invoke the perspective from which a political community can consciously understand itself as an autonomous agent  
 spatial language  question type  and young children s ability to describe clothing  legal and developmental implications children s descriptions of clothing placement and touching with respect to clothing are central to assessing child sexual abuse allegations  this study examined children s ability to answer the types of questions attorneys and interviewers typically ask about clothing  using the most common spatial terms  on off  outside inside  over under   ninety seven 3  to 6 year olds were asked yes no  e g    is the shirt on     forced choice  e g    is the shirt on or off     open choice  e g    is the shirt on or off or something else     or where questions  e g    where is the shirt    about clothing using a human figurine  clothing  and stickers  across question types  children generally did well with simple clothing or sticker placement  e g   pants completely on   except for yes no questions about  over   suggesting children had an underinclusive understanding of the word  when clothing or sticker placement was intermediate  e g   pants around ankles  and therefore neither completely on nor off   children performed poorly except when asked where questions  a similar task using only stickers and boxes  analogous to forensic interviewers  assessments of children s understanding  was only weakly predictive of children s ability to describe clothing  the results suggest that common methods of questioning young children about clothing may lead to substantial misinterpretation  
 stabilization and the impact of changing patterns of energy investment more than a decade of investor state tension in which states sought to rebalance arrangements with international investors in the light of rising commodity prices is now a matter of history in the energy industry  1 some of the disputes that resulted from that fractious period continue in arbitration or litigation proceedings  and plenty of new disputes have emerged since  but those that had their roots in actions by states seeking what they saw as a fairer deal with investors benefiting from high rents are increasingly rare on the time lagged landscape of investment disputes  during this period  the interplay between investors and states took on at least one new feature that continues to play a role in the very different investment context of today  what we might call a diversification of both investors and states became evident  with an influx of new states aspiring to market their wares to international energy investors  especially in oil and gas  their novelty lies not in their statehood but rather as new entrants in the competition for investment capital characteristic of states with actual or prospective reserves of petroleum  many have rapidly evolving economies after a period of prolonged conflict  meaning that guarantees offered are particularly vulnerable to a review in the near to medium term  indeed  a number of them have been willing to commence that process of review even before production of the resource has commenced  at the same time  the kind of offer held out by such states has been particularly attractive to a new kind of energy investor  either private equity investors on the one hand  or small  explorationfocussed companies on the other  neither being likely to be motivated by the decades long view of an investment typically associated with an international oil company  ioc   for them  stability guarantees are no less important but they serve a different purpose  and are linked to an exit strategy in the foreseeable future  this combination of players new market entrants and their rather unconventionally short term approaches to the stability of long term contractual arrangements have raised questions about the adequacy of traditional guarantees of contract stability  yet  it has attracted little attention in the writings on energy disputes  in this article  i want to revisit this twin feature of recent and current energy investment and consider its significance for the notion of stabilisation in long term petroleum contracts  
 starting out on a judicial career  gender diversity and the appointment of recorders  circuit judges  and deputy high court judges  1996 2016 this article is a quantitative study of those who are appointed recorders and circuit judges  and who are authorized or appointed as deputy high court judges  it considers the period 1996 2016  being the twenty years that straddle either side of the creation of the judicial appointments commission  jac   a key focus is the gender diversity of these appointments and how this has changed over time  including whether the transfer of appointments to the jac has made a difference to gender diversity or whether increases in the proportions of female judges are attributable solely to a changing demographic among the pool of lawyers from which such judges tend to be appointed  who are appointed to these positions is significant both because of the importance of the positions themselves  but also because they comprise the pool from which  as a practical reality  the senior judiciary is appointed  
 state aid control in south east europe  waiting for a wake up call the south east european  see  countries  having signed stabilisation and association agreements with the european union  are required to establish an operationally independent state aid monitoring authority  to harmonise their legislative framework with that of the eu  and to demonstrate a credible enforcement record  this paper analyses whether these requirements for eu accession have been achieved so far  the authors conducted a comparative cross country analysis and tried to identify common problems and enforcement trends  as the paper elucidates  the see countries have largely met the eu requirements by harmonising their national state aid acts and corresponding by laws with eu law  however  these rules are applied in a different socio economic context and by national authorities of dubious independence from the government  which results in a modest enforcement record  as may be derived from the pre accession experience of the countries of central and eastern europe  the effectiveness of state aid control mechanisms is conditioned by the credibility of the country s eu perspective  and the south east european countries have only just started their european journey  
 state ownership in terms of transition  curse or blessing this article argues that the institutional framework within transition economies  including the lack of a liquid capital market and a competitive product market  in addition to the focus on public benefits and socioeconomic development  favors state owned companies in terms of a non market based system notwithstanding the popular concept of transaction costs and corporate efficiency  despite the apparent costs of state ownership  including political considerations  soft budget constraints  and weak profit motivations  there is a rational choice for state ownership in cases when private firms are not able to deliver the same quality of goods at a lower cost  therefore  this article offers another insight into questions of corporate efficiency and alternative governance models of state ownership in transitional economies based on the example of kazakhstan  it attempts to determine whether the models of state ownership existing in transition economies diminish institutional shortcomings and have important implications for capital costs  
 state ownership of petroleum resources  an obstacle to shale gas development in the uk  shale gas development in the uk has been slow due to various challenges to the industry  one of them is the state ownership of shale gas resources  which leaves private landowners without any rights to shale gas resources under their land  this article explains why the private ownership of petroleum resources contributed to the rapid shale gas development in the usa and how the different ownership model is a potential barrier to the development in the uk  it is argued that as long as private landowners have no incentive to support shale gas production on private land  shale gas development is delayed by the landowners  reluctance to provide energy companies the right to access their land  therefore  in order to enhance the cooperation between landowners and energy companies  and thus support the shale gas development in the uk  landowners  rights and interests should be better taken into account in the regulatory framework  
 state power and diffusion processes in the ratification of global environmental treaties  1981 2008 there have been many explanations for why countries ratify global environmental treaties  they range from neorealist theory  to hegemony theory  world society theory  and network embeddedness theory  drawing on hegemonic transition theory  this paper provides evidence that prior to the fall of the soviet union  strong and weak countries ratified a treaty if the usa or the ussr ratified the treaty first  after the fall of the soviet union  countries  proximity to world society institutions increased the likelihood of ratifying a treaty  and only weaker countries emulated the ratifications of the usa and russia  however  weaker countries also emulated economic  religious  and language peers  diplomatic ties  and neighbors as well  in contrast  more powerful countries ratified treaties more independently  we studied the ratifications of eight universal environmental treaties by 166 countries between 1981 and 2008 and showed that as the geopolitical context changed  the diffusion process changed  the paper argues that the hegemonic transition which took place in the late 1980s and early 1990s was an enabling event that helped to explain the new roles that major powers assumed in the 1990s and 2000s and opened the door to the ascendency of global institutions and broader participation in the environmental regime  
 status courts this article identifies and analyzes a new type of specialized  problem solving  court  status courts  status courts are criminal or quasi criminal courts dedicated to defendants who are members of particular status groups  such as veterans or girls  they differ from other problem solving courts  such as drug or domestic violence courts  in that nothing about the status court offender or the offense he or she committed presents a systemic  problem  to be  solved   in fact  status courts aim to honor the offender s experience and strengthen the offender s association with the characteristic used to sort him or her into court  this article positions status courts as both a troubling and promising development in the evolution of problem solving justice  in particular  and criminal justice reform  generally  it reveals that status courts institutionalize the notion that certain offenders  by virtue of their inclusion in a particular status group  deserve better treatment than others  this  moral sorting  provides an expressive release that may  counterintuitively  disincentivize widespread systemic reform  and yet  while status courts present cause for concern  they also advance a positive  and possibly transformative  notion  that some individuals commit criminal offenses  at least in part  because of the influence of external factors beyond their control  in this way  status courts challenge the retributive notion that criminal offenders are wholly independent  rational actors and counterbalance the othering effect of many current criminal justice practices  because the rise of retributive ideals played a prominent role in ramping up the penal machinery over the past few decades  embracing this new  contextualized conceptualization of criminal offenders beyond the status court context can temper the tendency to over incarcerate  
 statutory interpretation and the many virtues of legislation the question of statutory interpretation is closely connected to convictions we have in our political theory  this article explores one such connection  focusing on the relationship between the respect owed to legislative decisions and our interpretive practices  it develops two arguments in this regard  the first argument traces the way varying understandings of modern legislation and alternative accounts of the value of legislative practices entail different modes of statutory interpretation  the second argument criticises existing theories of statutory interpretation for assuming a monolithic account of the value of legislation and suggests that different approaches to statutory interpretation might be appropriate for dealing with different exercises of legislative power  
 still underwater  the need for temporary foreclosure and mortgage relief for victims of future natural disasters over four years ago  superstorm sandy decimated new york and new jersey  homes were destroyed  individuals were displaced  and the costs of repairing damaged properties were enormous  many superstorm sandy victims could not maintain their monthly mortgage payments  and as a result faced foreclosure  this note proposes that new jersey adopt legislation providing temporary foreclosure and mortgage relief to victims of future natural disasters  part ii of this note describes fema s origination and its role in assisting natural disaster victims  part iii outlines superstorm sandy s destructiveness and its impact on homeowners  part iv explains the national flood insurance program and specifically why so many superstorm sandy victims had underpaid flood insurance claims   part v describes hud s role in helping natural disaster victims and the state sponsored programs in new york and new jersey that used grants from hud to assist superstorm sandy victims  parts vi and vii outline additional problems  such as foreclosure  that superstorm sandy victims faced while trying to return to their homes  part viii examines new jersey legislation that provides temporary foreclosure and mortgage relief for superstorm sandy victims  finally  part ix describes the terms of this note s legislative proposal and the policy basis for enacting temporary foreclosure and mortgage relief for victims of future natural disasters  
 structuring pre plea criminal discovery ninety seven percent of federal defendants plead guilty  and they rely on prosecutors for much of the information about the governments case on which the decision to plead is based  although federal prosecutors routinely turn over most necessary discovery to the defense  the law does not require them to turn over any discovery before the guilty plea  this can lead to innocent defendants pleading guilty and to guilty defendants pleading guilty without information that could have affected the agreed upon sentence  this article argues that the lack of a judicially enforceable pre plea discovery regime flouts structural protections that due process is supposed to provide  defendants who plead not guilty and go to trial get a jury to adjudicate guilt and a judge to preside over the proceedings and pronounce sentence  the judge and jury hear an adversarial presentation of the evidence  and the judge at sentencing can consider an even broader spectrum of information about the defendant and the crime  but defendants who plead guilty effectively act as their own judge and jury  unfortunately  because prosecutors are not required to provide any pre plea discovery  the defendant who pleads guilty may not have nearly as much information as the judge and jury would have had at trial and sentencing  the supreme court has employed a balancing test to determine whether a particular procedure comports with due process  this article proposes tailoring that test to the pre plea discovery context  the proposed test would ask  1  whether the defense is getting sufficient information before the guilty plea to promote accurate sorting of the innocent from the guilty and reasonably informed and consistent sentencing   2  whether there are there clear rules that allow judges  before a guilty plea  to regulate prosecutors decision not to disclose  and  3  whether the production of pre plea discovery in a given case imposes undue costs on society  one hopeful development is that several district courts  pursuant to congressionally granted authority  have promulgated local rules for pre plea discovery  although the constitution does not require it  i argue that congress should adopt several of these time tested rules to give both clear standards to prosecutors and authority to judges to enforce liberal pre plea discovery  
 stuck  the law and economics of residential stagnation america has become a nation of homebodies  rates of interstate mobility  by most estimates  have been falling for decades  interstate mobility rates are particularly low and stagnant among disadvantaged groups despite a growing connection between mobility and economic opportunity  perhaps most importantly  mobility is declining in regions where it is needed most  americans are not leaving places hit by economic crises  resulting in unemployment rates and low wages that linger in these areas for decades  and people are not moving to rich regions where the highest wages are available  this article advances two central claims  first  declining interstate mobility rates create problems for federal macroeconomic policymaking  low rates of interstate mobility make it harder for the federal reserve to meet both sides of its  dual mandate   ensuring both stable prices and maximum employment  low interstate mobility rates also impair the efficacy and affordability of federal safety net programs that rely on state and local participation  and reduce wealth and growth by inhibiting agglomeration economies  while determining an optimal rate of interstate mobility is difficult  policies that unnaturally inhibit interstate moves worsen national economic problems  second  the article argues that governments  mostly at the state and local levels  have created a huge number of legal barriers to interstate mobility  land use laws and occupational licensing regimes limit entry into local and state labor markets  different eligibility standards for public benefits  public employee pension policies  homeownership subsidies  state and local tax regimes  and even basic property law rules inhibit exit from low opportunity states and cities  furthermore  building codes  mobile home bans  federal location based subsidies  legal constraints on knocking down houses  and the problematic structure of chapter 9 municipal bankruptcy all limit the capacity of failing cities to  shrink  gracefully  directly reducing exit among some populations and increasing the economic and social costs of entry limits elsewhere  combining these two insights  the article shows that big questions of macroeconomic policy and performance turn on the content of state and local policies usually analyzed using microeconomic tools  many of the legal barriers to interstate mobility emerged or became stricter during the period in which interstate mobility declined  while causation is difficult to determine  public policies developed by state and local governments more interested in guaranteeing local population stability than ensuring successful macroeconomic conditions either generated or failed to stymie falling mobility rates  the article concludes by suggesting how the federal government could address stagnation in interstate mobility  
 suicidal self stabbing  a report of 12 cases from crete  greece sharp force trauma is a popular cause of homicide and suicide in many countries  characterisation of the injuries between the two is crucial for a differential diagnosis  the current paper reviews 12 self inflicted sharp force trauma deaths from the island of crete in greece  forensic reports between 1999 and 2015 were collated  and we studied the number and location of injuries  the demographic characteristics of the deceased  the sharp object and the medical history of the deceased  one third of the cases where the forensic reports were available  3 10  involved multiple injuries  and one case involved a combination of stabbing and hanging  most injuries involved a kitchen knife  ninety two per cent  11 12  of the victims involved male greek nationals aged  50 years  the type and location of injuries were not found to be specific to suicide alone  thus  death scene investigation remains crucial to the differential diagnosis between suicide and homicide  this is the first report on self inflicted sharp force fatalities in greece  
 sunshine over shanghai  can the wto illuminate the murky world of chinese soes  state owned enterprises  soes  are a major force in the chinese economy and a growing presence in international trade and investment  the challenge to the wto legal regime is commercial  given the size of soes and their share of chinese output  and political  given worries that trade and investment by soes may be driven by public policy goals  and both challenges may be exacerbated by the murky world of chinese soes  in this article  i first review whether chinese soes are a problem for the wto  and whether more sunshine on their operations might be a useful discipline  i then ask what we know about soes inside the wto  including in the trade policy review mechanism  since the answer is  not much  i consider whether mega regional trade negotiations offer a better approach  my answer being negative  i finally consider whether an attempt to negotiate a wto reference paper on soes might help  i conclude that transparency is likely to be a better discipline on the spillovers associated with soes than a search for binding rules  while also helping everyone better understand the efficiency effects  
 superseding dublin  the european asylum system as a non cooperative game the european asylum system operates according to the  dublin system  rules  where the responsible member state will be the state through which the asylum seeker first entered the system  this has been immediately a source of controversy between states  a fairer system would be based on quotas  where host countries share the burden according to appropriate criteria  but member states never reached a common agreement  in this paper we offer a vision of the european asylum system as a non cooperative game where states compete to reduce their asylum burden  as the two different systems  dublin like or quotas  lead to different equilibriums  according to the pareto criterion the preferred system is the one where all states are better able to achieve their national objectives  we examine the conditions under which a relocation system based on quotas may be preferable to the dublin rules  and why greater consideration of the humanitarian aspects of asylum can favour its adoption and reinforce cohesion of the system   c  2017 elsevier inc  all rights reserved  
 supreme court elections  how much they have changed  why they changed  and what difference it makes this essay draws on four recent studies of elections to state supreme courts in the united states to probe widely perceived changes in the scale and content of electoral campaigns for seats on state supreme courts  evidence from these studies and other sources indicates that changes have indeed occurred  though they are more limited than most commentaries suggest  these changes stem most directly from trends in state supreme court policy that have attracted interest group activity  especially from the business community  like their extent  the effects of change in supreme court campaigns have been meaningful although exaggerated by many observers  what we have learned about changes in supreme court elections has implications for choices among selection systems  but those implications are mixed and complex  
 survey evidence in china s trademark lawsuits  an empirical study a consumer survey  as an instrument used to gather data on the beliefs and attitudes of consumers towards trademarks or products  is considered to have vital influence in trademark litigation  in recent years  courts have come to rely increasingly on the results of surveys conducted by one or both litigants in trademark lawsuits  the practical issue for trademark litigants is determining whether  when and how to develop survey evidence  given the cost  time  and other constraints  to shed light on this specific issue  we undertook a statistical analysis of trademark infringement cases in china  by examining 17 836 cases decided by china s courts over a 16 year period from 2001 through 2016  this article presents an empirical study assessing the statistical relationship between the presentation of survey evidence and case outcomes  the goal of our study is to help trademark litigants to determine the importance and value of presenting consumer surveys in trademark infringement case and make more informed decisions about their litigation strategies  
 tablet computers and forensic and correctional psychological assessment  a randomized controlled study mobile computing technology presents various possibilities and challenges for psychological assessment  within forensic and correctional psychology  assessment of justice involved persons facilitated by such technology has not been empirically examined  accordingly  this randomized controlled experiment involved administering questionnaires about risk needs  treatment readiness  and computerized technology opinions to a large  n   212  and diverse sample of individuals under custodial correctional supervision using either a tablet computer or traditional paper and pencil materials  results revealed that participants in the paper and pencil condition completed the packet of questionnaires faster but omitted items more frequently  older participants and those with lower levels of education tended to take longer to complete the tablet administrated measures  the tablet format was rated as more usable irrespective of demographic and personal characteristics  and most participants across the 2 conditions indicated that they would prefer to use computerized technology to complete psychological testing  administration format did not have a clear effect on attitudes toward correctional rehabilitation services  noteworthy for researchers is the substantial time saved and absence of practical problems with the tablet condition  implications for practitioners include the general usability of the devices  their appeal to incarcerated persons  and the potential for tablets to facilitate clinical and administrative tasks with corrections clients  considering the novel nature of this study  its promising results  and its limitations  future research in this area is warranted  
 tagmarks hashtags are trending  and not just on social media  by 2016  producers had federally registered hundreds of hashtags as trademarks and asserted exclusive rights in thousands of others  but by failing to pay close attention to context and consumer perception  the uspto may have overlooked issues that render many hashtag trademarks   tagmarks   unregistrable  this article provides a history and taxonomy of hashtags and explores the protectability problems that plague tagmarks  rather than sweeping generalizations about their status  tagmarks require nuanced analysis that takes into account their use  distinctiveness  and history in order to more accurately determine whether and when they merit protection as marks  to strike a better balance among the competing trademark concerns of consumer protection  producer reward  and speech  the uspto should revise its examining procedures to mandate that every tagmark be categorized as  primarily merely a hashtag  until an applicant can establish that its mark actually functions as a sourceindicator  
 take or pay  a different perspective  ensuring top clauses always come out on top in australia this article examines the enforceability of take or pay clauses in gas sales agreements in australian courts  recent case law has raised the possibility of take or pay clauses being deemed penal and void  particularly under the penalty doctrine in equity  australian courts have made clear that a failure of any contractual stipulation would be sufficient to engage the penalty doctrine in equity   a lower threshold than the breach of contract required at common law  this article examines the recent jurisprudence and the penalty doctrine in australia to determine the key conditions that are required for a contractual clause to be deemed a penalty  this article argues that take or pay clauses do not fall within the ambit of the penalty doctrine and should thus be valid and enforceable  especially in the context of the high capital projects in which it operates and the reciprocal benefits that the clause offers to the parties involved  this article also briefly examines the significant reform to the area by the english makdessi case  which appears to have been adopted by the australian high court  a nuanced view of the traditional understanding of the mechanism has also been proposed in the article in an attempt to better represent the operation of the mechanism and argue that the clause is not and should not be construed as penal in nature or effect  
 taking life and liberty seriously  reconsidering criminal liability under article 2 of the echr what is the relationship between the right to life and criminal liability  and what should it be  given the significance we rightly attribute both to human life and to human freedom  this article explores the circumstances in which the european court of human rights imposes a positive obligation to criminalise and pursue criminal forms of redress  and concludes that the court s doctrine carries the potential of both coercive overreach and dilution of the right to life itself  these problems are compounded by opacity in the court s doctrine  i propose a way forward that takes both the right to life and human freedom seriously  
 tax evasion in spanish personal income tax by income sources  2005 2008  from the synthetic to the dual tax this paper estimates spanish personal income tax  irpf  evasion by income sources  between 2005 and 2008  applying the methodology of feldman and slemrod  econ j 117 327 352  2007  to the irpf taxpayers panel database published by the instituto de estudios fiscales  spanish institute for fiscal studies   from the estimates carried out  four conclusions can be drawn  first  that the greatest tax compliance throughout the period is found in labour income and the lowest in income from movable capital  second  that the level of compliance is  in general  lower in 2008 than in 2005  third  that  with the exception of income from movable capital  compliance is greater for the top 50  of taxpayers  fourth  that the lowest level of compliance is found in the group of regions with better structural economic characteristics  aragon  catalonia and madrid  
 taxation of cross border transfers of carbon emission allowances under linked emissions trading schemes economic arguments in support of linking emissions trading schemes suggest that such linking could provide access to lower cost abatement options and increase market stability  the decisions of whether and how to link emissions trading schemes often focus on the design features of the relevant schemes  but an additional factor which has the potential to undermine the efficiency of linked schemes is taxation  this article systematically tests two alternative approaches to the direct  income  taxation of cross border transfers of emission allowances for differential tax outcomes  four hypothetical transactions are considered under three different linking mechanisms and on the assumption that a tax treaty based on the oecd model tax convention on income and on capital is in force  this analysis evidences that  in some cases   and especially if the relevant jurisdictions adopt different approaches to the taxation of allowance transactions under domestic law   there is the potential for timing differences or double taxation that could impact on the efficiency of the linked trading schemes  it is therefore important for tax implications to be considered as part of any linking proposal  
 teaching ob gyn residents bioethics within a catholic healthcare context residents entering training in the specialty of obstetrics and gynecology  ob gyn  often have misconceptions as to what medical interventions roman catholic healthcare institutions prohibit  and why certain restrictions are placed on the provision of reproductive health options that are otherwise legally available to women  the ethical and religious directives for catholic healthcare services  produced by the united states conference of catholic bishops seeks to provide a stable framework upon which reproductive health decisions can be based  however  catholic healthcare ethics may conflict with secular bioethical assertions that place a premium on autonomous patient choice  residents training in part or whole at a catholic institution may feel frustration at what they perceive to be a conflict with current secular ethics paradigms such as access to abortion  contraception  sterilization  and assisted reproductive technologies  the recent adoption of clinical competencies by the accreditation council for graduate medical education  acgme   directs that residents shall be trained to function within the framework of their larger healthcare system   systems based practice    this article will first  clarify areas of conflict and convergence between catholic and secular reproductive ethics  which are unique to ob gyn training  next  using the acgme s new clinical competency in systems based practice as a model  a rationale for incorporating catholic healthcare ethics into an ethics curriculum for ob gyn residents will be discussed  finally  guidelines for faculty tackling the problem of how to teach catholic healthcare ethics will be described  incorporating the rich tradition of catholic healthcare ethics into the educational curriculum of ob gyn residency fulfills training requirements while exposing young physicians to a rational decision making framework in bioethics  
 technoheritage this article explores the legal revolution that is swiftly unfolding regarding the relationship between technology  user interactivity  and cultural institutions  both inside and outside of the law  at the same time that cultural properties are facing destruction from war and environmental change  we are also living in an age of unprecedented interactivity and reproduction everywhere  museums are offering their collections for open access  3 d printing  and new projects involving virtual and augmented reality  with the advent of other sophisticated forms of digital technology  the preservation and replication of antiquities have never been easier  today s archaeological moment demonstrates both the possibilities and limitations behind  technoheritage  the marriage of technology and cultural heritage  toward that end  this article argues that  in order to understand the relationship between technology and cultural heritage  it might be helpful to study the theoretical dimensions behind interactivity itself  just as technology has the power to preserve and protect ancient artifacts  it also invites a dizzying array of legal conflicts over their digitization and replication  particularly with regards to the intersection of copyright law with cultural identity  unpacking this further  this article offers a tripartite taxonomy of interactivity  the first  described as extractive  drawing upon the accumulation and selection of data   the second  immersive  drawing upon new forms of user participation through virtual and augmented reality   and the third  derivative  drawing upon new possibilities of user creation   normatively  i argue that these models of interactivity provide us with an important framework with which to examine the importance of copyright protection for cultural heritage  in the concluding section  i suggest a potential way of rethinking the museum by drawing on the logic and legal protection extended to databases and archives in an age of unprecedented user interactivity  
 telling friend from foe  environmental cues improve detection accuracy of individuals with hostile intentions purposedetecting deviant behaviours that precede and are related to crimes can help prevent these crimes  research suggests that the psychological mindset of wrongdoers may differ from others  such that they are more anxious  self focussed  and vigilant  as a result  their responses to environmental cues  specifically those that signal risk of exposure  may differ  methodin two randomized controlled trials  participants with high  vs  low  cognitive load walked a pre defined route to carry out a hostile or non hostile task  en route  participants were exposed to a strong  vs  mild  cue from a security officer  study 1   or a cue  vs  no cue  resembling police walkie talkie static noise  study 2   participants filled out a questionnaire measuring psychological constructs  reactions during the task were recorded and presented to independent observers to determine the participants  intent  resultsparticipants with high  vs  low  cognitive load who were exposed to a strong  vs  mild or no  cue while carrying out their task were more often correctly identified by observers as either innocent or hostile based on their behaviour  analysis of the questionnaire revealed that the experience of hostile intentions is related to anxiety  inhibitory control of anxiety  activation control of normal behaviour  and to other relevant constructs which may explain why cues that signal risk of exposure can improve the detection accuracy of individuals with hostile intentions  conclusionthese studies show that cues that signal risk of exposure can improve the detection of wrongdoers and the role of self regulation in the suppression of anxiety and deviant behaviours  
 temporal aspects of the interaction between national law and eu law  reintroducing the protection of legitimate expectations preliminary rulings of the european court of justice have an ex tunc effect unless the court itself specifies otherwise  which it does only in exceptional circumstances  while that approach seems to enhance the uniform and effective application of union law from a temporal perspective  it sits uneasily with a separate strand of case law concerning the protection of legitimate expectations and legal certainty  in the recent case of dansk industri  the court considered the relationship between these lines of case law  and gave complete priority to the temporal effect of its rulings  we argue that this approach is not only normatively unsatisfactory in and of itself  but also that giving more prominence to the protection of legitimate expectations would permit the court to take more nuanced views on controversial matters in substance  
 temporary refuge from war  customary international law and the syrian conflict the rule of temporary refuge forms the cornerstone of the response of states to large scale influx of refugees  in the context of civilians fleeing armed conflict  this legal rule imposes a positive obligation on all states to admit and not to return anyone to a situation where there is a risk to life  and to provide basic rights commensurate with human dignity  also implicit in the rule is the expectation of shared responsibility for large numbers of refugees and of international cooperation towards finding durable solutions  this article examines the customary international law of temporary refuge  also known as temporary protection  in relation to the syrian conflict  it discusses implementation of the rule in the practice of three countries neighbouring syria  and in the eu  it finds that the practice of turkey  lebanon and jordan has been consistent with the rule of temporary refuge  however  the eu has decided not to use the temporary protection directive  instead individual member states have relied on the refugee convention and eu law  combined with various other measures not pertinent to temporary protection  it is concluded that shared responsibility is the linchpin of temporary refuge  absent this keystone  the rule of temporary refuge is likely to continue to be implemented primarily in a regional context by those countries nearest to the country affected by the conflict  as in the case of syria  
 testing justification for segment based relevant product market definition in merger control  evidence from turkey in this paper  we aim to investigate whether different segments of beer products can constitute a separate relevant product market within the framework of competition law  this question gained importance when the merger between anheuser busch inbev and sabmiller became subject to a phase ii investigation by the turkish competition authority in march 2016  which ultimately ended with an unconditional clearance decision  based on an intact  beer  market  recognizing that the relevant product market regarding beer brands in turkey must be wider than the premium segment  to answer the research question above concerning relevant product market definition  we implement a hypothetical monopolist test in two steps  in the first step  the aggregate price elasticity of demand for the premium segment is estimated econometrically by using a nested logit demand model  this model tests whether products in the same group are closer substitutes than products in different groups  we conclude that the correlation of beers within the same group is not statistically significant  since the data in our study are obtained at the retail level  the price elasticity of demand at the brewer level is derived from the estimate at the retailer level by using very conservative assumptions with regard to the pass through rates  in the second step  the hypothetical monopolist test is implemented by using the critical elasticity which is calculated by using the profit margins for the premium beer segment at brewer supplier level under both 5 percent and 10 percent ssnip  it is seen that the actual elasticity of demand for the premium segment is larger than the critical elasticity  in absolute value  under both scenarios  these findings show that the relevant product market regarding beer brands in turkey must be wider than the premium segment  
 testing the limits of the law against those who test the tribunal s limits since the modern era of international criminal law began with the establishment of the ad hoc tribunals  international criminal institutions have produced numerous notable developments ranging from substantive to procedural law  contempt proceedings  which were not prescribed under the ad hoc tribunals  statutes  exemplify this trend  at the special tribunal for lebanon  stl   which also does not have express reference to contempt in its statute  the judges determined that they have inherent jurisdiction over contumacious conduct and that this extends beyond any geographic  temporal and personal jurisdictional limits applicable to substantive crimes contained in the stl statute  the amicus curiae led prosecutions at the stl have seen dramatic legal innovations  including the application of the stl s contempt jurisdiction to corporate entities  the following analysis examines several of the most significant legal issues that have arisen during contempt proceedings at the stl  including the parameters of the charge of undermining public confidence in thetribunal  the extent of thetribunal s ability to run a trial without the accused s participation and the nascent issue concerning the efficacy of the tribunal s enforcement and cooperation regime  this analysis questions whether the context of contempt proceedings has come to serve as a laboratory of international criminal law  in which parties and judges moot and adjudicate new legal theories thus far untested in proceedings for substantive crimes  it explores potential ramifications and difficulties entailed by these innovations  particularly as concerns cooperation and enforcement and it assesses the coherence of these developments with the stl s law governing its primary mandate  namely to address the 2005 attack in beirut during which the former lebanese prime minister  rafiq hariri and others were killed  
 the   princelings   and the banks  when does a legitimate business practice become criminal corruption in violation of the foreign corrupt practices act  the foreign corrupt practices act   fcpa  prohibits the bribery of foreign public officials  when does hiring a relative of a foreign official cross the line into criminal activity in violation of the act  we suggest that there should not be an absolute prohibition on hiring qualified relatives of foreign officials  rather  there must be clear safeguards to prevent quid pro quo arrangements that further corruption  we examine the lack of case precedents under the statute and look to cases under other statutes that examine the definition of quid pro quo to look for analogies to the fcpa  we conclude with how the doj and sec could clarify this murky line between legal and illegal activity  thus giving companies operating abroad certainty that their hiring will not be the subject of fcpa enforcement action  
 the  development  discourse in multilateral trade lawmaking the impact of the idea of development  in multilateral trade lawmaking is often reduced to the principle of special and differential treatment   which exempts developing countries from certain obligations imposed by the trade regime  the article shows that development  has always presented a much wider challenge to the vision of the trade regime championed by the major trading nations  the development discourse has conceived the trade regime s historical significance  the regime s aims  and the relationships among its members in ways that were often fundamentally at odds with the conception preferred by most developed countries  the article explores how the development discourse has informed lawmaking initiatives by developing countries throughout the history of the trade regime  while not all of these initiatives were successful or necessarily fruitful  they show that the pursuit of development in trade lawmaking has always been more than an effort to seek exemption from trade rules  
 the  reasonable man   his nineteenth century  siblings   and their legacy the reasonable man is the best known  but not the only  legal construct to be born into the nineteenth century common law  this article introduces the man s siblings including those from the areas of trust law  criminal law  contract law  and intellectual property law  both patents and trademarks   the fact that some of these  men  changed the law is not controversial  this research firrther highlights that while several of these came to life in that century  only some had a significant role into the twentieth century  those that did are tied to the foundations of our society through their role in facilitating innovation and consumer protection  the argument is that it was the constructs  nature and their capacity to accommodate public policy issues that enabled the vitality of the  reasonable person   negligence  and the person skilled in the art   patents   
 the  triangle  of australian energy law and policy  omissions  connections and evaluating environmental effects utilising the theory of the  energy law and policy triangle   this article analyses the consequences of not having a comprehensive national energy policy  whereby economics  environment and politics are all included  while focusing on two of the three points of the triangle economics and environment the australian 2015 energy white paper has not incorporated the third fully the politics of energy security and environmental protection is also inadequate  the article argues that the absence of a comprehensive national energy policy leaves australia open to piecemeal  reactive approaches to critical issues  using the example of the south australian nuclear fuel cycle royal commission it highlights the implications of a federal policy vacuum  as whatever decisions the south australian government takes on waste disposal  it is unclear whether the australian government will support them  it recommends the development of a comprehensive policy  clearer links between aspects  and to apply strategic environmental assessment to significant environmental effects of policy  
 the ability to detect false statements as a function of the type of statement and the language proficiency of the statement provider the ability to detect deception is critical in criminal and investigative contexts  society continues to become more diverse as international travel becomes more commonplace  as such  it has never been so essential to understand the potential impact of speakers  language proficiency on assessing their credibility  recently  deception researchers have turned their attention to statements provided by nonnative english speakers  thus far yielding inconsistent results  to further investigate this issue  community members  who were classified into 4 english proficiency groups  i e   fluent  higher proficiency  medium proficiency  and lowest proficiency   provided 4 statements  these included true and false statements that were autobiographical  and true and false statements that were opinion centered  observers rated the likelihood that these speakers were being truthful or deceptive  observers  accuracy and discrimination were best for the lowest proficiency speakers  the other proficiency groups did not differ from each other  this suggests that lie detection is more effective when speakers provide statements in their nonnative language  however  relative to fluent english speakers there was a smaller truth bias for the lowest proficiency speakers  which suggests that if nonnative speakers provide their statements in their nonnative language they may be judged as more deceptive than their native speaker counterparts  overall the present findings highlight the need for additional research  given the disparate results in the literature and the lack of clear policies regarding how nonnative speakers  credibility should be assessed  
 the absence of method in statutory interpretation many textualists see canons of interpretation as a means to deal with statutory ambiguity  while nontextualists are more likely to turn to legislative history  this essay explores some of the problems with each approach  for canons  determining which context is the best one to analyze  and for legislative history  determining which statements are reliable and which are hot air  
 the absolute and the relative dimensions of constitutional rights the principle of proportionality is necessary if it can claim validity in all legal systems  what can claim validity in all legal systems has absolute validity  on the other hand  what can only claim to have validity in some legal systems has merely relative validity  this distinction is applicable not only to the principle of proportionality as a norm about the application of constitutional rights  but also to the constitutional rights themselves  and to the institutionalization of the protection of constitutional rights by means of constitutional review  this leads to three questions  which are systematically closely connected   1  do constitutional rights have an absolute character   2  does the principle of proportionality have an absolute character   3  does constitutional review have an absolute character  only the first two questions shall be discussed here  
 the abyei arbitration and the rule of law this article examines the widely publicized international arbitration that took place in 2008 2009 to determine the boundaries of the abyei region of southern sudan in the wake of decades of civil war  on the surface  the abyei arbitration is a striking example of how arbitration can resolve even the most intractable international disputes  but a closer examination suggests an award that invoked principles of judicial restraint and the rule of law  but compromised those principles by disregarding the terms of the tribunal s mandate and the thoroughly reasoned determination by experts appointed by the parties  the abyei award instead fashioned a diplomatic solution intended to reduce the risks of renewed warfare between the parties  that solution produced neither peace nor a stable sudan  which has been torn by violence in the years since the award  including in the abyei region  but whatever future results it produces in sudan  the tribunal s award also raises important questions about the rule of law and international adjudication  by adopting a result based less on the law and the facts than on an apparent political compromise  the abyei award arguably undercut key principles of international law that have developed over the last century  
 the administrative board of review of the european central bank  experience after 2 years this article examines the administrative remedy provided by the administrative board of review  abor  of the european central bank  ecb   as part of the broader issue of the right of defence of natural and legal persons vis a  vis ecb supervisory decisions within the single supervisory mechanism  ssm   after presenting an overview of the review panels established in the financial sector in the eu  the article describes the experience with the abor by analysing its composition  its mandate and scope of review  the main procedural aspects and the relationship with judicial proceedings before the european court of justice  particular attention is given to the substantial issues dealt with by the abor in its opinions and to some of the major challenges faced in the first 2 years of practice  among them is the assessment of the correct application of national laws implementing eu legislation by the ecb  the paper identifies two aspects giving particular cause for concern and requiring legislative reforms   1  the assessment of the suitability of the members of management bodies  fit and proper assessment  and  2  the inclusion of bank holding companies within the scope of banking supervision  
 the agoa extension and enhancement act of 2015  the sa us agoa negotiations and the future of agoa the african growth and opportunity act  agoa  is a non reciprocal preferential trade programme that the us offers to 49 sub saharan african countries  president obama s decision to extend agoa  which was set to expire at the end of september 2015  for another ten years  2015 to 2025   was highly controversial  the extension and enhancement of agoa act  signed into law by president obama  on the 29 june 2015  had thus included many new provisions to incorporate the views of the us congress on the implementation of the ten year extension and the future trajectory of agoa  in this paper  the new extension and enhancement of agoa act is analysed to elucidate the new and additional powers that the new agoa act provides the us congress  the us administration  and us business lobbies  and the implications of these changes for sub saharan african countries  at least three new trends in the 2015 agoa act can be identified  payment for preferences  institutional attrition  and a shift to reciprocity  these trends  it is argued in this paper  are potentially contrary to a more mutually beneficial relationship between the us and africa  the paper offers some reflections on the future of agoa  
 the ahistoricism of legal pluralism in international criminal law international criminal law  icl  is legally plural  and not a single  unified body of norms  trials for international crimes involve a complex dance between international and domestic criminal law  the specificities of which vary markedly from one forum to the next  to date  many excellent scholars have suggested that the resulting doctrinal diversity in icl should be tolerated and managed under the banner of  legal pluralism   to our minds  these scholars omit a piece of the puzzle that has major implications for their theory the law s history  neglecting the historical context of the international and national criminal laws that have informed and continue to inform icl leads to the uncritical adoption of criminal law doctrine as a proxy for diverse social  cultural  and political values  this is often a false equation that results in important normative distortions  with major implications for the field s self image  function  and legitimacy  in particular  scholars and courts overlook that much criminal law doctrine globally is the result of either a colonial imposition or an  unsuccessful  legal transplant  in this article  we revisit a cross section of this missing history to contribute to both legal pluralism and icl  for the former  we demonstrate that there is nothing inherently good about legal pluralism  and that in some instances  a shift from its descriptive origins to a more normative managerialism risks condoning illegitimate law  for icl  our historiography shows how partiality is embedded in the very substance of icl doctrine  beyond just the politics of its enforcement  at one level  this realization opens up the possibility of renegotiating  at least in certain circumstances  a universal icl that is actually more plural in terms of values and interests than doctrinal pluralism  at another  it suggests that institutions capable of trying international crimes need to do far more to step away from the ugly legal history they have inherited  
 the american death penalty decline american death sentences have both declined and become concentrated in a small group of counties  in his dissenting opinion in glossip v  gross in 2014  justice stephen breyer highlighted how from 2004 to 2006   just 29 counties  fewer than 1  of counties in the country  accounted for approximately half of all death sentences imposed nationwide   that decline has become more dramatic  in 2015  fifty one defendants were sentenced to death in thirty eight counties  in 2016  thirty one defendants were sentenced to death in twenty eight counties  in the mid 1990s  by way of contrast  over 300 people were sentenced to death in as many as two hundred counties per year  while scholars and journalists have increasingly commented on this decline and speculated as to what might be causing it  researchers have not examined it empirically  this article reports the results of statistical analysis of data hand collected on all death sentencing  by county  for the entire modern era of capital punishment  from 1990 to 2016  this analysis of death sentencing data seeks to answer the question why a few counties  but not the bulk of the others  still impose death sentences  we examine state and county level changes in murder rates  population  victim race  demography  and other characteristics that might explain shifting death sentencing patterns  we find that death sentences are strongly associated with urban  densely populous counties  second  we find that death sentences are strongly associated with counties that have large black populations  third  we find homicide rates are related to death sentencing in three ways  within and between death sentencing counties  within and between death sentencing counties following a lag to account for the time it can take for a case to proceed to a sentencing  and that counties with more white victims of homicide have more death sentencing  fourth  we find that death sentencing is associated with inertia or the number of prior death sentences within a county  these results suggest what remains of the american death penalty is fragile and reflects a legacy of racial bias and idiosyncratic local preferences  we conclude by discussing the practical and legal implications of these trends for the much diminished death penalty and for criminal justice more broadly  
 the apple e books case  when is a vertical contract a hub in a hub and spoke conspiracy  apple s economic role in the publisher conspiracy to increase amazon s below cost pricing of e books is examined in a hub and spoke conspiracy framework  the five major e book publisher defendants   the publishers   conspired because of their concern that amazon s low prices would adversely affect physical book demand and prices and also create an amazon retail monopoly under which amazon would negotiate substantially lower wholesale e book prices  the publisher conspiracy successfully moved amazon to an agency relationship and gained control over e book retail pricing  the publishers accomplished this by jointly threatening amazon with windowing  delaying the release of new e book titles   which imposed a significant potential cost on amazon in the face of apple s scheduled entry without windowing  apple therefore economically facilitated the publisher conspiracy solely through its entry  not through any of its ibookstore contract terms  contrary to the court  the most favored nation  mfn  and maximum price terms in the apple contracts had no effect in facilitating the publisher conspiracy  in fact  if apple had entered without these contract terms  e book prices would have been substantially higher  consequently  apple s contracts should not have been evaluated under a per se standard  
 the asian infrastructure investment bank  bringing  asian values  to global economic governance  this article examines the recent establishment of the asian infrastructure investment bank  aiib  through the prism of the  asian values  debate  it maps the key attributes of these  asian values  first  to the institutional governance structure of the aiib  and second  to its proposed decision making procedures  specifically  in relation to the criteria and process for evaluating  assessing  and monitoring the economic  social and environmental sustainability of infrastructure projects that this new multilateral development bank  mdb  will be supporting  the object of this exercise is to postulate whether an  asian values  approach to international development finance can be proposed as a viable alternative to currently western dominated institutions of global economic governance and ultimately  the anglo american form of capitalism that still underpins the global economy  the twin roles of china within the aiib  first as the financial catalyst for aiib investment in regional infrastructure projects  and second  as a potential regional hegemon through its dominance of the aiib governance structure  will be canvassed  the article concludes by proposing an  asian values  approach to global economic governance as the foundation of a new research agenda which can be used to assess the future operations of this bank and other new mdbs  
 the award on the merits in the case brought by the philippines against china relating to the south china sea  a critique the tribunal constituted under unclos in the proceedings brought by the philippines against china has now rendered its award on the merits  this prompts two questions  first  does the award strengthen the doubts which have been expressed about whether the tribunal ought to have taken jurisdiction over the case  and second how cogent is the reasoning of the tribunal on the substantive issues raised by the philippines  this paper aims to explore both of these questions  
 the banking union and national authorities 2 years down the line some observations from germany with the institutional setting for the banking union having been established and become fully operational  market participants  supervisory staff  and academics are gradually getting to terms with the reality of the new two tier system of supervisory and resolution authorities within the eurozone  drawing from media coverage  input from practitioners and the on going academic debate  the present article seeks to present an inevitably provisional assessment of the new regime from a german perspective  while regulatees and their advisers within the country appear to have got used to the new reality  the paper also identifies a number of residual concerns  some of which are attributable to the specific characteristics of the german financial sector  others indicative of broader problems  
 the bankruptcy of refusing to hire persons who have filed bankruptcy in 1978  congress made it illegal for government employers to deny employment to  terminate the employment of  or discriminate with respect to employment against a person who has filed bankruptcy  in 1984  congress extended this prohibition to private employers by making it illegal for such employers to terminate the employment of  or discriminate with respect to employment against a person who has filed bankruptcy  under the law as it currently exists  private employers can refuse to hire a person who has filed bankruptcy solely because that person has filed for bankruptcy  meanwhile  employers have substantially increased their use of credit history checks as a pre employment screening device  credit history checks will disclose bankruptcy filings  and because blacks and latinos are overrepresented among bankruptcy filers  these groups are disproportionately affected by bankruptcy discrimination  this disparate impact probably violates title vii of the civil rights act of 1964  moreover  there is scant empirical support for the proposition that creditworthiness is a reliable proxy for workplace performance or employee trustworthiness  relying on bankruptcy status simpliciter is antithetical to a core purpose of the bankruptcy system  which is to give debtors a fresh start  employers  prerogatives to operate according to whatever employment policies and practices they want should be balanced against employees  and potential employees  right to participate in the labor market in an environment free of irrational discrimination  it is irrational to deny employment to a person who is or was a debtor if the person is otherwise qualified  and the job can be successfully performed regardless of bankruptcy status  to allow such discrimination makes the bankruptcy system s promise of a fresh start illusory  
 the black hole problem in commercial boilerplate rote use of a standard form contract term can erode its meaning  a phenomenon made worse when the process of encrustation introduces various formulations of the term  when they occur  rote usage and encrustation weaken the communicative properties of boilerplate terms  leading some terms to lose much  if not all  meaning  in theory  if a clause is emptied of meaning  it can create a contractual black hole in which  as the term loses meaning  random variations in language appear and persist  what  then  are the consequences if parties exploit these variations in language by successfully advancing an interpretation the market disavows  traditional doctrine holds that even if the court errs in the meaning it gives to a clause  parties have an incentive promptly to revise the standard language to exclude the aberrant interpretation  but what if the assumptions about the costs and motivations to revise this type of boilerplate are wrong  we seek purchase on this question with a study of the pari passu clause  a standard provision in sovereign debt contracts that almost no one seems to understand  this clause gained fame in 2011 because of a series of court decisions in new york arguably misinterpreting a particular variation of the clause  even though the courts  interpretation put at risk a multitrillion dollar debt market  meaningful revisions to the language of the boilerplate term did not begin to appear until late 2014  in the interim  trillions of dollars in bonds were issued with an uncorrected version of the term  market forces  in other words  worked slowly to remedy a systemic problem that caused substantial costs  we ask whether the state could do more to avoid the problem at the front end rather than depend on market forces to correct court error at the back end  
 the case for double blind lineup administration many have recommended that lineups be conducted by administrators who do not know which lineup member is the suspect  i e   a double blind administration   single blind lineup administration  in which the administrator knows which lineup member is the suspect  increases the rate at which witnesses identify suspects  increasing the likelihood that both innocent and guilty suspects are identified  although the increase in correct identifications of the guilty may appear desirable  in fact  this increase in correct identifications is the result of impermissible suggestion on the part of the administrator  in addition to these effects on witness choices  single blind administration influences witness confidence through an administrator s feedback to witnesses about their choices  reducing the correlation between witness confidence and accuracy  finally  single blind administration influences police reports of the witness s identification behavior  with the same witness behavior resulting in different outcomes for suspects depending upon whether the administrator knew which lineup member was the suspect  administrators who know which lineup member is the suspect in an identification procedure emit behaviors that increase the likelihood that witnesses will choose the suspect  primarily by causing witnesses who would have chosen a filler  known innocent member of the lineup who is not the suspect  to choose the suspect  to avoid impermissible suggestion  photo arrays and lineups should be administered using double blind procedures

 the climate rent curse  new challenges for burden sharing the literature on the  resource curse  has strongly emphasized that large incomes from resource endowments may have adverse effects on the growth prospects of a country  conceivably the income generated from emission permit allocations  as suggested in the context of international climate policy  could have a comparable impact  effects of a  climate rent curse  have so far not been considered in the design of permit allocation schemes  in this study  we first determine when to expect a climate rent curse conceptually by analyzing its potential channels  we then use a numerical model to explore the extent of consequences that a climate rent curse would have on international climate agreements  we show that given the susceptibility to a curse  permit allocation schemes may fail to encourage the participation of recipient countries in an international mitigation effort  we present transfer schemes that enhance cooperation and limit adverse effects on recipients  
 the cold war and comparative law  a reflection on the politics of intellectual discipline how much does the current state of comparative legal studies owe to cold war political imperatives  what happened to our discipline once such imperatives declined in the aftermath of the bipolar world  comparative lawyers have been completely naive about the impact of the cold war on their own discipline both as it reached maturity in the 1950s and as it developed after the fall of the berlin wall until now  this consequence of the professional depoliticization of comparative law is especially troublesome since the cold war has accompanied in its entirety the historical moment in which the common law tradition  especially in its u s  epiphany  has been able to conquer global legal hegemony  thus  the current disciplinary knowledge of comparative law  the very toolkit of our methodology  has developed in the context of the cold war confrontation and has reached full global dominance in its aftermath  it is worth thinking about possible implications of this context on the professional project of legal comparativism if we wish to maintain an acceptable level of critical understanding of ourselves  
 the color of kinship this article addresses the need for family law scholarship that better theorizes and grapples with how race informs american life in the 21st century  family law scholars have been instrumental in documenting and advocating for recognition of the  new kinship  familial relationships and affective ties forged outside of marriage and amidst dramatic demographic shifts  in doing so  though  they have largely ignored race  focusing instead on matters such as gender or class  the assumption is that kinship is race neutral  but  in fact  kinship has a color  part ii explores this reality by analyzing cramblett v  midwest sperm banks  llc  a case involving a lesbian mother who filed a wrongful birth suit when the insemination process she underwent resulted not in the white baby desired  but a child who is partially black  part iii explains how the colorblind approach that informs much of family law scholarship undermines the ability of scholars in this area both to interrogate cases like cramblett and to offer meaningful solutions to the problems that families confront  part iv advocates for a new approach to issues of family and race  including whiteness  mapping a research agenda and alternative vision for family law scholarship  this article urges greater attention to the ways in which race informs the functioning of all families and intersects with issues like sexual orientation and class  this article also makes the case that family law scholars can advance the national debate about race and inequality in the united states by offering insights into the ways in which family law systems and policies shape notions of race and structure inequality across a range of areas  
 the concept of  due diligence  in the un guiding principles on business and human rights due diligence is at the heart of the united nations guiding principles on business and human rights  which establish the main parameters internationally for considering corporate responsibility for human rights violations  however  the guiding principles invoke two different concepts of due diligence  the first is a process to manage business risks and the second is the standard of conduct required to discharge an obligation  in this article  we show that the guiding principles invoke these two concepts without explaining how they relate to each other  this confusion creates uncertainty about the extent of businesses  responsibility to respect human rights and uncertainty about how that responsibility relates to businesses  correlative responsibility to provide a remedy when they infringe human rights  on this basis  we propose and justify an interpretation of the guiding principles that clarifies the relationship between the two concepts of due diligence  
 the concept of establishment and data protection law  rethinking establishment the regulatory success of the concept of establishment results from its multifaceted nature  the concept provides the regulator with a versatile tool  able to adapt its meaning to the specific policy principles of the area of law in which it is used  this article analyses the data protection concept of establishment and examines the extent to which the new data protection regulation perpetuates the status quo  it demonstrates how the court of justice of the eu  cjeu  has modernised the establishment notion with its landmark rulings  google spain and weltimmo  and how these judgments have helped the term  establishment  make a legislative transition from the old data protection directive to the new data protection regulation  an analysis of the revised data protection concept of establishment on objective  territorial and subjective grounds shows that conditions now exist to support a higher degree of formality in the formulation of the constituent elements of establishment  as this concept remains substantial in essence  for establishment still requires both a certain structure through which  minimal  activity is conducted  future developments should be cautious in allowing the legal reach of the establishment to extend further  in particular  beyond its objective limits  
 the concepts of law concepts are the building blocks of legal doctrine  all legal rules and standards  in fact  are formed by combining concepts in different ways  but despite their centrality  legal concepts are not well understood  there is no agreement as to what makes a legal concept useful or ineffective worth keeping or in need of revision  social scientists  however  have developed a set of criteria for successful concepts  of these  the most important is measurability  the ability  at least in principle  to assess a concept with data  in this essay  we apply the social scientific criteria to a number of concepts and conceptual relationships in american constitutional law  we show that this field includes both poor and effective concepts and conceptual links  we also explain how the examples of poor concepts could be improved  
 the consequences of prisoners  micro resistance for more than twenty years  scholars have called for greater attention to the consequences of micro resistance to legality  using archival data from philadelphia s eastern state penitentiary  1829 1875   i examine the consequences of noncompliant prisoner behavior  i find that prisoners  noncompliance often entailed substantial costs to prisoners  particularly in comparison to the substantial benefits of complying with the prison regime  despite its cost to prisoners  noncompliance did not have a single set of uniformly negative consequences for the prison regime  in fact  some forms of noncompliance may have actually protected the prison s reputation  prison administrators  external allies  and critics used episodes of noncompliance for their own goals and to reinforce their preexisting claims about the propriety of competing prison designs  yielding this variable significance of noncompliance  as this study illustrates  connecting prisoner misconduct to power dynamics in the broader field produces a fuller understanding of micro resistance s consequences  
 the conservative project to  break the link between british courts and strasbourg   rhetoric or reality  the conservative party has repeatedly pledged to replace the hra with a british bill of rights  with the aim of breaking the link  between domestic courts and strasbourg  this article examines the implications of this proposal  the nature of the current relationship with the european court  and the extent to which the link has already been weakened  it considers the bases of the conservative proposal  and the options available in breaking that link in a bill of rights  taking account of the potential introduction of limitation clauses and the possibility of according strasbourg judgments against the uk an advisory status only  finally  taking account of the european court s recent movement towards enhanced  subsidiarity  it will examine the consequences for the protection of human rights of reliance on a bill of rights intended to be interpreted and applied independently of strasbourg influence  
 the constitution of intellectual property as an academic subject this essay offers a reinterpretation of the constitution of intellectual property as an academic subject by focusing on the work of thomas anthony blanco white  1916 2006   his textbooks were fundamental for the development of intellectual property  in britain and the commonwealth  not only did they provide the basis for a discipline in the making  their timely publication also helped to connect and  more importantly  constitute a diverse audience of articled clerks  practitioners and students  this essay traces the making of blanco s first booklets and his subsequent rewriting of them  which culminated in the publication of what would become a standard textbook writing technique in british intellectual property in the twentieth century  in explaining the history of these textbooks and their pivotal role for the recognition of intellectual property as an academic subject in the university curriculum  the essay explores the ways in which a distinctive knowledge of and writing about intellectual property emerged in britain in the post war years  
 the constitution of police violence police force is again under scrutiny in the united states  several recent killings of black men by police officers have prompted an array of reform proposals  most of which seem to assume that these recent killings were not  or should not be  authorized and legal  our constitutional doctrine suggests otherwise  from the 1960s to the present  federal courts have persistently endorsed a very expansive police authority to make seizures to stop persons  to arrest them  and to use force  this article reveals the full scope of this fourth amendment seizure authority  suspicion plays a critical and familiar role in authorizing seizures  but less attention has been given to the equally important concepts of resistance and compliance  demands for compliance with officers and condemnations of resistance run throughout constitutional doctrine  police are authorized to meet resistance with violence  ostensibly race neutral  the duty of compliance has in fact been distributed along racial lines  and may be contrasted with a privilege of resistance  also race specific  protected elsewhere in american law  tracing resistance and compliance helps reveal the ways in which the law distributes risks of violence  and it may help inspire new proposals to reduce and redistribute those risks  instead of condemning all resistance  constitutional doctrine could and should protect certain forms of non violent resistance both in police encounters and in later court proceedings  embracing resistance could help constrain police authority and mitigate racial disparities in criminal justice  and surprisingly enough  it may yet reduce violence  
 the constitutionality of election thresholds in germany germany is often thought of as home to the hurdle or threshold requirement  parties that fail to obtain 5 percent of the votes in an election are excluded from sitting in parliament  this idea has been widely copied throughout the world  although the five percent threshold has not been implemented everywhere  and other variations on the theme exist  recently  however  doubts have started to emerge in germany itself about the hurdle  it remains constitutionally valid in federal and state elections  but the federal constitutional court has recently held it invalid in european elections  its decision deserves endorsement  although it had a range of justifications for holding the hurdle invalid some remarkably insightful  some rather less praiseworthy  
 the costs of civil justice and who pays  this article examines current debates about delivering access to justice in a shrinking state  specifically the supreme court s claim in coventry v lawrence  no 3   2015  uksc 50 that it is impossible to deliver access to justice for all litigants without widely available legal aid  and broader claims that the state is failing in its duty to provide access to justice for all  it argues that the level of public subsidy and the balance between public and private funding for civil justice systems is a question of distributive justice  a critical review of private funding models demonstrates that some have been denied access to justice  however  requiring litigants to pay for their own access to justice  or to even subsidise access for other litigants  is defensible in principle and practice  private funding models based on cross subsidisation between users could substantially reduce the access to justice  gap  experienced by many  provided they meet certain criteria  
 the covert administration of medications  legal and ethical complexities for health care professionals the practice of covertly administrating medications to patients likely occurs in hospitals  long term care residents and within the family home  1 concealing medications in the patient s food and drink is a practice that should be viewed from both a legal and ethical lens  in this paper  i look at the practice of covertly administering medications to patients without their consent in a legal framework  looking at the legal rules around the right of patients to consent to and refuse medical treatment  additionally  i extend this discussion to the professional duties and obligations of health care professionals as it relates to the decision making process of whether the health care professional engages or does not engage in the covert administration of medications  in doing so  i begin the analysis from a canadian perspective  but draw upon relevant legislation  guidelines and polices from other countries as they help to elucidate and identify different considerations  
 the current crisis of europe  refugees  colonialism  and the limits of cosmopolitanism  cosmopolitan europe   the normative commitment that is widely understood to undergird the project of the european union  is under threat as never before  this is manifest perhaps most prominently in europe s collective failure to respond to the refugee crisis  as people flee war and destruction  we  in europe  debate whether now is the time to give up on our human rights commitments  france is under a state of emergency and the uk in the process of withdrawing from the european union and its associated institutions  including the european convention on human rights   voices have been raised against the burdens  financial and social  placed upon us by those we see as other  with few public voices calling for europe to remember its traditions of hospitality and stated commitments to human rights  in this article  i discuss the growing distance between the claims and practices of european cosmopolitanism  its roots in our shared colonial past  and the implications for the future  
 the dangers of legislating based on mythology  the serious risks presented by the anti regulatory agenda of the 115th congress and the trump administration although section 1  article i of the u s  constitution vests  all legislative powers  in the congress of the united states  the constitution is largely silent as to exactly how congress should exercise these awesome powers  over the years  the u s  house of representatives has developed a process by which legislation is vetted and perfected through the prudential conduct of hearings and markups  for the most part  this process has worked  and  when we arguably err  the presidential veto as well as the u s  supreme court provide checks  nevertheless  there are times when the need for a legislative response by congress appears to lack a factual basis or is facetious  the likelihood of this occurring increases when both the congress and the executive branch are controlled by the same political party  thereby diminishing our government s system of checks and balances  during such times  the risk of ill conceived legislation becoming law is heightened  such is our concern with respect to a series of anti regulatory measures recently considered by the house and which may be supported by the republican controlled u s  senate and the trump administration  after providing a brief overview of the federal rulemaking process  we will debunk the principal myths cited in support of these anti regulatory measures and then highlight some of the most problematic aspects of the legislation currently under consideration by congress  
 the data driven future of international economic law the availability of more data and new ways of analyzing it is changing the way we do empirical legal research  with the help of modern technology we can study adjudicators  awards and agreements in greater numbers  less time and more detail opening the doors for new research questions  theory building and legal technology applications for scholars and practitioners  this introduction to the journal of international economic law special issue on new frontiers in empirical legal research provides a first take on this data driven future  it distinguishes data driven research from more traditional methods by pointing to  1  its  data first  attitude   2  its ambition to look at all the available data rather than subsamples thereof and  3  its focus on computing rather than reading or counting  data driven research comes with new promises  but also challenges and limitations  while it allows researchers to uncover latent structures  debunk past myths and even forecast the future  it also requires new skills and competencies including an ability to tell patterns from noise in inductive data analysis  we argue that the time is ripe to overcome these challenges and to seize the opportunities of the new data driven frontier in empirical legal scholarship  
 the david effect and isds the legitimacy of international investment law is fiercely contested  chiefly  scholars argue that investor state dispute settlement empowers corporations from rich nations over governments of poor ones  some also assert that poor nations facing investment claims have limited ability to improve their standing in this setting of adjudication  based on a first of its kind experiment conducted on 257 international arbitrators  this article argues that one avenue to improve standing is for developing countries to exploit their  underdog  status  we presented arbitrators with a vignette describing an investor state dispute and randomly assigned different features to test their effect  our results suggest arbitrators are prone to a particular type of bias   surveyed professionals were more likely to grant poor respondent states reimbursement of their legal costs compared to wealthy states when the respondent won the dispute  based on this  david effect   we argue for re conceptualizing investor state arbitration as a tool for partially mitigating power imbalances  
 the deformation of contract in the information society the hla hart memorial lecture  delivered at oxford on 24 may 2016  the lecture considers how the advent and growth of the information society is posing challenges for the traditional theories of contract  and for the duties of the state with regard to contractual ordering  in particular  the lecture considers the lack of  fit  between certain prevalent 
 the demand for fiduciary services  evidence from the market in private donative trusts recent revelations on the use of fiduciary services raise concerns regarding their use for tax and creditor avoidance  yet given the secrecy shrouding much of the fiduciary industry  we do not know which fiduciary services are used for such purposes  and to what extent  shining a light on a particularly obscure part of the industry  this article presents and analyzes the results of the first ever global survey of professional service providers to private donative trusts  having obtained 409 usable responses from professionals in 82 jurisdictions  amplified by twenty five interviews conducted with professional trust service providers in five jurisdictions  i report new data on four controversial features of current trust practice   1  perpetual and extreme long term trusts    2  trust terms exonerating trustees from liability to beneficiaries   3  tools rendering beneficiaries  entitlements inaccessible to their creditors  and  4  the control of trusts by their creators  i find that trusts drafted to subsist for more than a century are fairly common  especially offshore  but many such trusts are not in fact likely to survive that long  trustee exculpatory terms are now standard in donative trusts serviced by professionals  with most settlors neither demanding nor receiving any quid pro quo for their inclusion  anti creditor techniques protecting beneficiaries  entitlements are even more ubiquitous than trustee exculpatory terms  particularly in trusts serviced by u s  resident providers  many protected beneficiaries are not less able than the average person to take care of their financial affairs  finally  express reservation of powers by trust settlors is a majority phenomenon in the united states  but a minority one elsewhere  the actual control of trusts by their settlors is likewise far more common in the united states than elsewhere  i conclude the article with recommendations for law reform that makes trusts likelier to benefit their beneficiaries and less likely to avoid duties owed to creditors and the state  
 the demystification of contracts in bankruptcy a company s ability to retain favorable contracts while escaping unprofitable ones is central to a successful reorganization in chapter 11 cases  yet a strange and elusive doctrine often leads the courts to impose unpredictable and perverse results in contract cases  the doctrine requires that a contract have a quality of executoriness   or it must leave the precincts of the bankruptcy code for an anarchic limbo where the courts fashion surprising and often unexplained relief  the american bankruptcy institute review commission ignored the unanimous recommendation of its committee of contract experts  preferring to retain this outdated doctrine with an explanation as unclear as many of the cases attempting to apply it  based on a reading of all contemporary executoriness cases  this article examines executoriness in each of the major categories of contracts where it imposes confusion and loss in reorganization practice and demonstrates the correct solutions to each  it does so by tying them to the fundamental economic and social policies underlying bankruptcy law  
 the developed developing divide on unilateral coercive measures  legitimate enforcement or illegitimate intervention  unilateral coercive measures are condemned by the un general assembly on a yearly basis for being contrary to international law and for having negative effects on human rights and the economy of developing states  although legal doctrine generally finds that the limitations of economic coercion are a grey area of international law  these resolutions could be indicative of an emerging prohibition  upon closer scrutiny  however  it would appear that they do not satisfy the required criteria as developed by international jurisprudence and doctrine for establishing a new custom  that being said  the resolutions clearly illustrate a divide between developed and developing states on the legitimacy of unilateral sanctions that should not be dismissed  in the interests of understanding how this division came into existence and how we can overcome it  the article proceeds to address the social factors that lead to its creation  
 the development and efficacy of a group intervention program for individuals with serious mental illness in jail providing cost effective means to treat the influx of individuals with serious mental illness entering the correctional system is a major challenge  failure to provide appropriate mental health treatment may lead to poor outcomes  including recidivism and suicide  group intervention is an effective and cost efficient way to provide mental health treatment  however  it has been understudied in jail settings  to meet the needs of jail inmates with serious mental illness  an eight week group based module curriculum was developed and studied through analyses of perceived usefulness  retention of key material  and associations with cognitive ability  improvement in psychiatric symptoms  and level of motivation  one week after the completion of a group session  the participants remembered the group topic and at least one key point from the group the majority of the time  better recall of group material was associated with better overall cognitive ability and motivation at discharge  participants found the groups to be somewhat to extremely useful 88 4  of the time  higher levels of usefulness were associated with reduced psychopathology and psychiatric improvement  as well as higher motivation at discharge  the findings provide support for the group intervention and implementation in a jail setting  further implications are discussed   c  2017 elsevier ltd  all rights reserved  
 the difference law makes  domestic atrocity laws and human rights prosecutions this article offers the first systematic analysis of the effects of domestic atrocity laws on human rights prosecutions  scholars have identified various political and sociological factors to explain the striking rise in human rights prosecutions over the past 30 years  yet the role of domestic criminal law in enabling such prosecutions has largely been unexamined  that is surprising given that international legal prohibitions against human rights atrocities are designed to be enforced by domestic courts applying domestic criminal law  we argue that domestic criminal laws against genocide and crimes against humanity facilitate human rights prosecutions in post authoritarian states by helping to overcome formal legal roadblocks to prosecution  such as retroactivity  amnesties  immunities  and statutes of limitations  using original data on domestic atrocity laws and human rights prosecutions in new democracies  we find that atrocity laws increase the speed with which new democracies pursue prosecutions  as well as the overall numbers of trials they initiate and complete  
 the difficulties of conflict classification at sea  distinguishing incidents at sea from hostilities incidents at sea between warships and military aircraft often involve more than provocative actions   they may be aggressive and can sometimes result in death and destruction  in view of the low threshold of a resort to armed force by one state against another that would bring an international armed conflict into existence  it is rather difficult to determine whether incidents at sea remain below that threshold  similar  albeit less difficult problems arise with regard to forceful measures taken by states against foreign merchant vessels  here it is important to clearly distinguish between law enforcement at sea and the exercise of belligerent rights  
 the distribution of power in the appointments clause judge merrick garland s thwarted supreme court nomination has divided legal scholars over the meaning of the appointments clause  while some believe that the senate and the president share the power to appoint principal officers  others contend that the president alone has the power to nominate and appoint them  to the former scholars  article ii  section 2  enables the president to nominate whomever he or she wishes  but it also empowers the senate to confirm or reject whomever it wishes  accordingly  the appointment power is divided between the two  meaning it is only exercised when both branches utilize their respective and discretionary powers  to the latter scholars  the same text gives the president the sole power to nominate and to appoint  with appointment subject to the senate s mandatory duty to advise and decide on whether to consent  therefore  advice and consent is a check by which the senate prevents the president from abusing his or her appointment power  triggered by the president s decision to nominate  this note argues that the latter scholars are correct because the founders  intent  the constitution s text  the doctrines of separation of powers and checks and balances  and long standing senate practice indicate that the appointment power is solely a presidential power  for judge garland  this conclusion means the senate violated its duty to hold hearings and to provide an opportunity for a vote on his nomination  more importantly for the nation  it means that the appointments clause requires the senate to apply to every nominee the process that it has designed for securing its consent  thus  the precedent established by the 114th senate of blocking all supreme court nominations during presidential election years  which will likely be followed and perhaps extended to mid term election years  contravenes the nation s fundamental constitutional structure  by failing to perform its duty  moreover  the 114th senate also deprived the nation of the benefits that the advice and consent process provides  such as greater accountability for the senate s confirmation or rejection of nominations and a more functional government  in doing so  the senate has placed political expediency ahead of the public interest  
 the dock on trial  courtroom design and the presumption of innocence this article examines the place of the criminal dock in courtroom design  challenges to the use of the dock have been based upon the inability of the defendants to hear effectively  to communicate with counsel  to maintain their dignity  and to benefit from the presumption of innocence  increasingly courts are incorporating secure docks  where defendants are partially or completely surrounded by glass  or in some countries  metal bars   to what extent do these changes and modifications undermine the right to the presumption of innocence  we present the results of an experimental mock jury study that was designed to test whether the placement of the accused influences jurors  perceptions  we find that jurors are more likely to convict defendants when they are located in a traditional dock or a secure dock  compared to sitting next to their counsel at the bar table  we conclude by discussing the implications for trial procedures  counsel communications  and courtroom design  
 the domestic well exemption in the west  a case study of santa fe s municipal ordinance in the case of bounds v  state of new mexico  the new mexico supreme court upheld the constitutionality of a statute that allows domestic wells to be permitted with less oversight than other water rights  the statute  known as the domestic well exemption  is common in various forms throughout the western united states  currently  there are an estimated 200 000 permitted domestic wells across the state of new mexico  increasing at a rate of approximately 5 000 per year  various scholars have argued for amendments to domestic well statutes or local regulations to make exempt well applications as rigorous as other water right applications  in consideration of local solutions  this study addresses one of few municipal ordinances and three important controversies in domestic well management  the interaction between domestic well pumping and other water uses  the longevity of groundwater sources  and the  development loophole   the city of santa fe s domestic well ordinance is found to indirectly address concerns related to aquifer use and conservation  however  policies restricting well uptake in threatened areas that speak to specific  measurable goals  aligned with accurate databases  may better serve municipalities and counties in new mexico as they do in other states  
 the duty to rescue at sea  in peacetime and in war  a general overview the duty to rescue persons in distress at sea is a fundamental rule of international law  it has been incorporated in international treaties and forms the content of a norm of customary international law  it applies both during peacetime and during wartime  albeit with the necessary adjustments to take into account the different circumstances  states are also under the duty to provide search and rescue services  this article discusses the content and limitations of these provisions and assesses their potential to ensure the protection of human lives at sea  furthermore  the article suggests that reference to the right to life  as protected in international human rights law  may be useful in further safeguarding human life and ensuring compliance by states with their duties  
 the economic aspect of the efficiency of patent activities based on case studies of leading ict enterprises research and development  r d  activity has become more expensive  in the literature  researchers have confirmed a correlation between a rise in the number of patents granted to large enterprises in the long term and increasing r  d expenditures  it can be assumed that patent activities are also more expensive  the objective of this article is to verify the following hypothesis  the number of granted patents can grow by increasing the efficiency of r  d expenditure management  while maintaining this spending amount at the same level over the long term  the research covers empirical data for the period 1997 2015  the hypothesis was confirmed for ibm  the uninterrupted leader for over 25 years in the number of patents obtained from the united states patent and trademark office  uspto   it has not been confirmed for samsung and canon  the second and third ranking companies in terms of the number of patents obtained from the uspto  the results in this research do not confirm the conclusions that are presented in the literature  the answer for the simple hypothesis of this article is not obvious  based on the ibm example  it was found that increasing the efficiency of r  d expenditures  while maintaining r  d expenditure at the same level  is a key factor in the success of the management of r  d within information and communication technologies  ict  enterprises  
 the economic effects of uber on taxi drivers in taiwan the ridesharing economy has caught a great deal of attention from researchers and policymakers  however  due to the dearth of available data  not much empirical evidence has been provided  this article empirically assesses the economic impact of uber service on taxi drivers  business performance using a case study in taiwan as an illustration  a difference in difference model is estimated using a population based dataset of 29 434 taxi drivers  the results indicate that uber reduced regular taxi drivers  service revenue by approximately 12 percent in the initial year and 18 percent in the third year of entry of uber  this result may suggest a substitution relationship between uber service and taxi operation  moreover  the negative impact of uber is more pronounced among taxi motorcade members  which may indicate that uber competes with taxi passengers who usually use an electronic device to call for ride service  by further looking at the capacity utilization and operating miles  it is evident that the negative impacts of uber on taxi drivers  service revenue are more likely associated with the reduction in operating miles of taxi drivers  to cope with competition from uber  taxi drivers are more likely to have advertisements in or on the taxicab and to provide better ride service  
 the effect of gender and relational distance on plaintiff decision making in the litigation process individuals  choices about whether to resolve disputes via litigation can be affected by their relationship with the potential defendant  i explore whether gender also plays a role  with women being less aggressive in legal tactics than men as their connection to the potential defendant becomes closer  the study uses a survey design with vignettes to explore decisions across the legal process  including the willingness to sue  responses to settlement offers  and whether or not to appeal  the survey varies the extent of the relationship between the potential plaintiff and defendant and includes two types of injuriesa slip and fall and pay discrimination  the findings reveal that once litigation has begun  women have a greater preference than men for mediation in both types of cases  but they are more resistant than men to settlement in discrimination disputes  neither men nor women s legal strategies seem to be affected by relational distance  
 the effect of paramilitary protest policing on protestors  trust in the police  the case of the  occupy israel  movement the use of paramilitary methods in civil policing tasks has become common in western police agencies  despite propositions that such methods should undermine the relationship between the police and the public  the effect of paramilitary policing on public trust in the police has not been empirically tested  in the present study  we examine this question in the context of protest policing  which has become a major concern for western police agencies  using a survey of 470 protesters who participated in occupy protest events in israel in 2012  we find that the perceived use of paramilitary methods has an independent and negative effect on trust  stronger than that of police effectiveness and the neutrality component of procedural justice  in depth interviews suggest that the significance of paramilitarism may be the result of a sense of alienation and criminalization it elicits among protesters who generally perceive themselves as law abiding citizens  
 the effect of tax expenditures on automatic stabilizers  methods and evidence we study the effect of tax expenditures on the stabilizing power of the tax system  we propose a micro simulation strategy that exploits links that we identify between automatic stabilizers  tax expenditures  and effective marginal tax rates  using u s  tax return micro data from 2000 to 2010  we estimate that  on average  the mortgage interest deduction and the charitable contributions deduction decreased the ability of the tax system to absorb fluctuations in aggregate consumption by an average of 7 4 percent and 3 9 percent  respectively  
 the effects of changes to legal aid on lawyers  professional identity and behaviour in summary criminal cases  a case study this article explores the effects of changes to legally aided representation on criminal cases in magistrates  courts according to data collected in an area of south east england  i consider the political factors that motivated changes to legal aid and suggest how these issues affecting lawyers  understanding of their role  and how that understanding affects the relationships between defendants  lawyers  and the magistrates  courts  i argue that the research indicates a potential relation between solicitors  risk taking behaviour in obtaining funding and the reintroduction of means testing  remuneration rates affect the service that defendants receive and the reintroduction of means testing decreased efficiency in summary criminal courts  ultimately  i argue that changes to legal aid funding have increased lawyers  uncertainty about their role  leaving them torn between acting efficiently and providing a good level of service  
 the effects of face to face versus live video feed interviewing on children s event reports purposerecent advances in technology have raised a potentially promising service to overcome difficulties associated with remote witnesses  live video feed interviews  the efficacy of this mode of interviewing  however  lacks empirical evidence  particularly with children in an investigative context  methodsthis study explored the effects of live video feed compared to face to face interviewing on the memory reports of 100 children  aged 5 12   children participated in an innocuous event and were interviewed 1 2days later by experienced interviewers  resultsanalyses indicated that live video feed interviewing was just as effective as face to face interviewing in terms of the accuracy and informativeness of children s accounts  video feed interviews  however  required a higher number of clarification prompts compared to face to face interviews  these findings were not influenced by children s familiarity with technology  conclusionsan initial test of live video feed interviewing indicates it is a safe and effective method for interviewing children about an innocuous event  
 the effects of one versus two episodically oriented practice narratives on children s reports of a repeated event purposeprevious research has found that children s reports of repeated events can be influenced by the presence and type of narrative practice in which they engage immediately prior to substantive recall  in particular  children s reports have been shown to benefit from practice providing narratives about an autobiographical repeated event  a gap remains  however  with regard to understanding whether practice narrating one episode of a repeated event encourages children to think about unique features of specific episodes  or whether practice of two episodes is required  the current study addressed this gap  methodsfive  to nine year olds  n 167  experienced four classroom activity sessions and were later interviewed  children provided a practice narrative about either one or two episodes of an autobiographical repeated event prior to discussing individual episodes of the activities  resultsolder children recalled more details from the activities when they had practised recalling two episodes compared to one episode  younger children did not benefit from the second episodic practice  many similarities were observed across conditions for children of all ages  conclusionsolder children were likely receptive to the subtle differences between conditions because of their advanced cognitive abilities  interviewers may assist older children to recall a larger amount of information if they first provide practice recalling two episodes of an autobiographical repeated event  however  a practice narrative about one episode may be sufficient to assist many children should two episode practice be unfeasible or interviewees are too young to benefit from recall of a second episode  
 the effects of single mother and single father families on youth crime  examining five gender related hypotheses this study examined the effects of the concentrations of single mother families  smfs  and single father families  sffs  on youth crime  five hypotheses  including the maternal  same sex  equality  prevalence and economic disadvantage hypotheses were formulated at the aggregate level and tested using data from 433 canadian municipalities  consistent with the prevalence hypothesis  it was found that the concentration of smfs had a much stronger conducive effect on youth crime than did the sffs  also  at high prevalence level  the effect of smfs was much stronger than its effect at low prevalence level  however  the significant but relatively weak effects of low income in smfs and sffs on youth crime offered only limited support to the economic disadvantage hypothesis  the findings suggest that one may need to consider factors and measures that are beyond the economic or financial aspect of the single parent families   c  2017 elsevier ltd  all rights reserved  
 the effects of twombly and iqbal ever since twombly and iqbal introduced the doctrine of plausibility pleading  a cottage industry of legal scholars  including myself  has undertaken to detect the effects of twombly and iqbal on litigants and case outcomes  results so far have been equivocal  and it has been hard to make sense of the disparate methodologies and findings  in this article  i develop a comprehensive yet nontechnical framework for empirically testing the effects of twombly and iqbal on lower courts and litigants  taking into account a wide range of confounding factors and the numerous ways in which twombly and iqbal may have indirectly affected litigant behavior  using this framework  i test for effects of twombly and iqbal on district court and litigant behavior using two datasetsone of administrative data covering over 700 000 cases  and one of detailed  hand  and machine coded docket and complaint data covering a representative sample of nearly 2 000 cases  i also review existing findings  i find only limited evidence that twombly and iqbal  the two most important pleading cases in 50 years  have had a major effect on the behavior of lawyers and judges across all cases  for represented plaintiffs  rates of dismissal with prejudice have held steady  motions to dismiss remain uncommon  and settlement and filing patterns have not changed appreciably in the wake of twombly and iqbal  there is  however  some evidence of effectspotentially major effectson pro se plaintiffs  further  while case outcomes for represented plaintiffs have been largely unaffected by twombly and iqbal  there is evidence that lawyers changed their pleading and motion practice in the wake of those cases  
 the elusive standard of care in medical negligence cases  the forensic expert must explain to a trier of fact what a defendant physician should have done  or not done  in a specific set of circumstances and whether the physician s conduct constitutes a breach of duty  the parameters of the duty are delineated by the standard of care  many facets of the standard of care have been well explored in the literature  but gaps remain in a complete understanding of this concept  we examine the standard of care  its origins  and who determines the prevailing standard  beginning with an overview of the historical roots of the standard of care and  using case law  tracing its evolution from the 19th century through the early 21st century  we then analyze the locality rule and consider local  state  and national standards of care  the locality rule requires a defendant physician to provide the same degree of skill and care that is required of a physician practicing in the same or similar community  this rule remains alive in some jurisdictions in the united states  last  we address the relationship between the standard of care and clinical practice guidelines  
 the eu debt crisis  testing and revisiting conventional legal doctrine controversies surrounding the european sovereign debt crisis loom prominent in the public debate  from a legal perspective  the no bailout rule and the ban on monetary financing constitute the main principles governing the legality review of financial assistance and liquidity measures  interpretation of these rules is full of empirical claims  according to conventional legal doctrine  bond spreads only depend on the country s debt position  largely ignoring other causal factors including liquidity  we test the hypotheses implicit in conventional legal reasoning  we find evidence that a significant part of the surge in the spreads of the peripheral eurozone countries was disconnected from underlying fundamentals and particularly from a country s debt position  and was associated rather strongly with market sentiments and liquidity concerns  we apply our empirical findings to the legal principles as interpreted by recent jurisprudence arguing that application of the no bailout principle and the ban on monetary financing should be extended to capture non debt related factors  also  the empirical results suggest taking recourse to alternative legal grounds for reviewing the legality of anti crisis instruments and allowing for a lender of last resort in the euro zone   c  2017 elsevier inc  all rights reserved  
 the eu s new approach to the two state solution in the israeli palestinian conflict  a paradigm shift or pr exercise  the eu s consistent policy towards the israeli palestinian conflict has been that israel s presence in the west bank  east jerusalem  the gaza strip  prior to the 2005 disengagement  and the golan heights is subject to the laws of belligerent occupation  that any purported israeli annexation is illegal and null and void  that israel s settlements in the territories are in breach of public international law and constitute a serious obstacle to peace  and that israel and palestine should settle their conflict on the basis of public international law and through the two state solution  in recent years the eu attempted to concretize this policy through its trade and trade related agreements with israel  withholding the benefits of eu israeli co operation from companies and research institutions based in the territories or operating therein  as well as from products produced therein  the new approach   thus  from the eu perception  the new approach towards the long standing conflict and its reliance on international law may be seen as an instrument to reinforce internal and external legitimacy  buttress identity cohesiveness and as a manifestation of its more robust effectiveness  but this article seeks to conduct a more careful and balanced analysis of the new approach and in doing so to reveal that the eu s  almost  exclusive focus on non governmental entities  such as corporations situated in the territories  and on territories  products  is misplaced in terms of public international law and effectiveness  the new approach s deficiencies  in abstracto and in concreto  as evaluated in this article  are likely to prevent it from serving as a paradigm shift in eu israel relations  
 the eurogroup  power and accountability this article considers the role of the eurogroup in eu decision making  a topic that is under theorised  more especially given its importance in the overall eu schema  the eurogroup s power has grown very considerably  largely because of the enhanced role that it has been accorded as a result of the financial crisis  with the result that its power no longer accords with the treaty provisions that specify its function  the article sets out the treaty foundations of the eurogroup  examines its role in eu decision making  the rationale for its increased power  and the extent to which it is politically and legally accountable  
 the european central bank in national criminal proceedings by relying on protocol no 7 on the privileges and immunities of the eu  the european central bank has emerged as an unlikely hurdle in the national criminal investigations into the financial malpractices of the banking sector in ireland  cyprus and  most recently  in slovenia  this article examines  for the first time  the scope of privileges and immunities on which the ecb can rely before national criminal authorities  it does so in three steps  first  it offers a best fit interpretation of the meaning of inviolability of archives  which remains contested in international law and unexamined in eu law scholarship  secondly  it defines the scope of privileges and immunities the governors of national central banks in their hybrid national supranational status can enjoy under eu law  this question too has still not been sufficiently addressed  let alone resolved  in either eu legal theory or its practice  based on this analysis  in a final normative turn the article addresses the ongoing compatibility of protocol no 7 with the contemporary legal and political nature of the eu  in so doing  it makes an original contribution to the field of privileges and immunities of the eu  which remains underdeveloped in conceptual and practical terms and which  as a result  in the context of the eu economic crisis has started to threaten the objectives of national economic and criminal justice  
 the european court of human rights facing the security council  towards systemic harmonization the ecthr is in the process of refining its conceptual tools for determining the responsibility of the states parties to the echr acting in execution of a security council resolution  where the implementation of resolutions involving the use of force is concerned  the court s recent case law has shown a shift towards systematic acceptance of the extraterritorial scope of the echr  as to whether the conduct in issue should be attributed to the states parties or to the un  the court now makes a clear distinction between operations authorized by the security council and un peacekeeping operations  the implementation of un economic sanctions will be addressed differently according to whether or not the respondent state is a member of the eu  the criterion of  equivalent protection  is only applicable in the former scenario  and in any event  it needs to be applied cautiously on a case by case basis  as regards the enforcement of economic sanctions by non eu member states  the court tends to interpret security council resolutions in a manner consistent with the obligations deriving from the echr  more generally  the court s approach is oriented towards systemic harmonization rather than towards normative conflict  
 the european insolvency regulation and the uncitral model law on cross border insolvency this article compares the recast european insolvency regulation of 2015 with the uncitral model law on cross border insolvency of 1997  focussed on their scope of application  international jurisdiction and the coordination of main and secondary proceedings  the scopes of both catalogues of norms and their rules on coordination of main and secondary insolvency proceedings reflect one another  however  the recast eir makes a significantly greater contribution to the unification of law and is also more fully differentiated and more precise  even if this comes at a price  namely  limited flexibility  the uncitral model law made an important contribution to the harmonisation of international insolvency law but requires now modernisation  copyright  c  2017 insol international and john wiley   sons  ltd  
 the european union as a global climate leader  confronting aspiration with evidence in rhetoric and action the european union has attempted to be a global leader in forging solutions to confront the problem of climate change  using unique survey data collected at five consecutive un climate summits from 2008 2012  this article provides evidence on the extent to which the eu is actually recognized as a leader in the unfccc climate negotiations  investigates how perceptions of eu leadership have evolved overtime  and helps make sense of the role that the eu has played in recent negotiation outcomes  the survey s findings show that recognition of the eu as a leader dropped sharply in 2009 at the cop 15 summit in copenhagen  but has climbed again in subsequent years  the results reveal a fragmented leadership landscape in which the eu must share or compete for leadership with other actors  such as the usa and china  who hold drastically different institutional design preferences and leadership visions than those promoted by the eu  the article s findings provide insight into the dynamics that both foster and frustrate the eu s aspiration to lead the effort to reach a deal on a binding post 2020 climate change agreement in paris at cop 21  
 the evolution of the eu external trade policy in services   ceta  ttip  and tisa after brexit the conclusion of the transatlantic trade and investment partnership  ttip  constitutes a priority and key component of the external trade policy of the european union  eu   it is also an immediate follow up to several years of regulatory cooperation between the two global trade powers  in an era of megaregionals  services is the only area where significant negotiating traction exists at the bilateral and multilateral level  however  recent events such as the imminent brexit and the withdrawal of the usa from the transpacific partnership  tpp  cast doubt on the future of trade deals  even so  services remain a key sector of export interest for the eu and thus completing agreements such as the ttip or the trade in services agreement  tisa  is of crucial importance  allowing the eu to create new opportunities for service suppliers but also to reshape the regulatory philosophy governing the future regulation of global trade in services  with respect to ttip  the eu commission  backed by the eu executive  has advanced an ambitious agenda and submitted a conditional offer to the us  hoping for further liberalization on the two sides of the atlantic  against this backdrop  this article offers a critical account of the eu external trade policy  focusing on the eu s recent external action with respect to services liberalization  the article advances three theses  first  that such ambitious agreements mark a new era of offensive services strategy which  however  is contained by internal conflicts and disagreements regarding certain still sensitive silos such as audiovisual or public services and brexit shall exacerbate such internal conflicts in the medium run  second  that megaregionals can be used to accelerate domestic regulatory reform and openness in the service sector  and third  that tisa will constitute a litmus test for the eu s commitment to the world trade organization  wto  cause  when appropriate  the article draws parallels with existing eu legislation and case law  other eu free trade agreements such as the recently concluded comprehensive economic and trade agreement  ceta  with canada  the general agreement on trade in services  gats   and tisa  
 the evolutionary game theoretic foundations of law interdisciplinary work in the law often starts and stops with the social sciences  toproduce a complete understanding of how law  evolutionary game theoretic insightsmust  however  supplement these more standard social scientific methods  toillustrate  this article critically examines the force of law by frederick schauer and the expressive powers of law by richard mcadams  combining the methods of analytic jurisprudence and social psychology  schauer clarifies the need for a philosophically respectable and empirically well grounded account of the ubiquity of legal sanctions  drawing primarily on economic and social psychological paradigms  mcadams highlights law s potential to alter human behavior through expressions that coordinate  still  these contributions generate further puzzles about how law works  which can be addressed using evolutionary game theoretic resources  drawing on these resources  this article argues that legal sanctions are ubiquitous to law not only because they can motivate legal compliance  as schauer suggests  but also because they provide the general evolutionary stability conditions for intrinsic legal motivation  in reaction to mcadams  this article argues that law s expressive powers can function to coordinate human behavior only because humans are naturally and culturally evolved to share a prior background agreement in forms of life  evolutionary game theoretic resources can thus be used to develop a unified framework from within which to understand some of the complex interrelationships between legal sanctions  intrinsic legal motivation  and law s coordinating power  going forward  interdisciplinary studies of how law works should include greater syntheses of contemporary insights from evolutionary game theory  
 the evolving landscape of title ix  predicting mandatory reporters  responses to sexual assault disclosures approximately 1 in 4 women is sexually assaulted in college  a problem that federal law has attempted to address with recent changes  under the evolving landscape of title ix  and related law  universities nationwide have overhauled their sexual assault policies  procedures  and resources  many of the new policies designate undergraduate resident assistants  ras  as responsible employees requiring them to provide assistance and report to the university if a fellow student discloses sexual assault  we investigated factors that predict the likelihood of ras enacting their policy mandate  that is  reporting sexual assault disclosures to university authorities and referring survivors to sexual assault resources  based on data from 305 responsible employee ras  we found that likelihood to report and refer varied  depending on ras  knowledge of reporting procedures and resources  trust in these supports  and perceptions of mandatory reporting policy  understanding mandatory reporter behavior is crucial  because help providers  responses can have serious implications for the recovery of sexual assault survivors  our findings elucidate some effects of changes in the interpretation and implementation of title ix  with potential to inform the development of more theoretically and empirically informed policies  
 the flexibility rule in administrative law administrative officials are permitted to have policies as to the exercise of their discretionary powers  but those policies must be flexible  not rigid  the flexibility rule  as i call it here  is nearly a century old  over time  it has become part of the furniture of judicial review  often used  rarely examined  that neglect has led to confusion  on display in recent cases  in this article i try to put the flexibility rule back on a sound footing  i argue  first  that the flexibility rule requires authorities to treat policies merely as rules of thumb  second  the primary justification for the flexibility rule is neither legislative intent  as courts have said   nor the avoidance of error  as commentators tend to assume   it is the value of participation  third  and as a result  the flexibility rule ought to apply to policies governing the use of prerogative and other non statutory powers  as well as to policies governing the use of statutory powers  
 the fundamental contradiction redux  liberty  coercion  and american legal development in liberty and coercion  the paradox of american government from the founding to the present  gary gerstle offers an ambitious account of american legal development from our nation s founding up to the present day  in many ways  gerstle s account is in keeping with the long scholarly tradition of linking legal liberalism with changes in american law and politics  however  liberty and coercion also calls to mind critical legal scholarship  most notably duncan kennedy s the structure of blackstone s commentaries and the idea of the fundamental contradiction  after reconstructing kennedy s central claims  i highlight how they actually undermine liberty and coercion and jeopardize the larger legal liberal tradition  
 the gendered impact of illegal act eviction laws in toronto and new york city   illegal act  eviction laws allow public housing providers to evict every member of a household on the basis of a single illegal act committed by a single person in their home  leaseholders and their dependents can be evicted even if they were not involved in the illegal act underpinning the eviction  an analysis of illegal act evictions carried out over the last six years by north america s two largest public housing providers  toronto community housing corporation and new york city housing authority  suggests that illegal act evictions laws have a grossly disproportionate impact on women  in both toronto and new york city  women are far more likely than men to be evicted for actions that they did not personally commit  in both cities  in at least 88  of instances where a leaseholder was evicted because of actions committed by another person  the leaseholder was a woman  also in both cities  women threatened with illegal act evictions actually committed the underlying illegal act in less than 35  of instances  men who face eviction are more likely to do so for their own actions  these trends hold true despite the fact that the laws governing each jurisdiction are interpreted quite differently  the results from this limited investigation beg further study and suggest that illegal act eviction laws unfairly impact women regularly punishing them for the actions of others  
 the genesis of independent agencies this article sheds light on significant doctrinal and policy issues that are central to the proper understanding of the administrative state  it grapples with a core question of administrative law  when are agencies established with features that insulate them from direct presidential control  because of its constitutional significance  the legal literature focuses on removal protection for agency heads  and posits that agencies are more likely to be accorded such protection when the presidency and at least one of the chambers of congress are controlled by different parties  the empirical support for this claim comes from a single political science stwly  which suffers from significant design flaws and has been widely misinterpreted  in fact  it shows that under almost all plausible scenarios congress is less likely to vest agencies with indicia of independence under divided government  to properly study the factors that affect the probability that agencies will be accorded indicia of independence we constructed and analyzed a new dataset  three principal variables have a statistically significant impact  the approval rating  of the president  the size of the senate majority  and the alignment of the political party of the senate majority and the president  the latter two variables had never been tested prior to our study  we find that congress is less likely to establish agencies with indicia of independence when the president is popular  moreover  when the senate majority is not aligned with the president  an increase in the majority makes it more likely that congress will establish an agency with indicia of independence  and  for a given size of senate majority  alignment with the president makes it more likely that congress will establish an agency with indicia of independence  changes in the composition of the house do not produce comparable effects  suggesting that the senate s filibuster rule or the senate s role in confirming presidential appointees might play a role in this regard  noting that the empirical results explain relatively little of the variation observed in the dataset related to when congress establishes agencies with indicia of independence  this article also explores the limitations of the quantitative empirical findings and the benefits of performing detailed case studies  
 the geography of campaign finance law constitutional law is committed to a principle of geographic self government  congressional districts and states are separately located and entitled to select different officials to send to congress  james madison explained in the federalist papers that checks and balances would only work if different places and their different politics were empowered to compete with and constrain one another  while constitutional law makes place significant for congressional elections  campaign finance law does not  those with the resources to contribute often and in large amounts to congressional campaigns primarily reside in a few neighborhoods in a few metropolitan areas  campaign finance law imposes no limitations and minimal disclosure on contributions from these places to other districts and states places quite different than the ones where contributors reside  the result is that a few metropolitan areas dominate contributions to congressional campaigns  campaign finance law thus allows congress to be controlled by very few places  dramatically undermining geographic self government  while scholars have devoted substantial attention to other problematic features of money in politics  the geography of campaign finance law is a different constitutional problem justifying different constitutional solutions  this article considers two types of legal responses  those that focus special attention on where campaign contributions are beginning and those that focus special attention on where campaign contributions are ending  while both types of solutions have their own respective constitutional benefits and negatives  they both share a common insight  only by making campaign finance law conscious of place can we begin to address the problems of the geography of campaign finance law  
 the global battle over copyright reform  developing the rule of law in the chinese business context nations and businesses around the globe have been battling over copyright protection laws  with industrialized nations pressuring developing nations to adopt  western style  copyright regimes  these battles are escalating as copyright piracy grows  while developing nations struggle to formulate reforms that will protect their own intellectual property as well as that of industrialized nations  china is at the cutting edge of these debates  over the last several years  and most recently in 2015  china has released transformative new proposals to reform its copyright laws  this article believed to be the first scholarly comparative analysis of china s reforms critiques china s new proposals  more broadly  this article examines china s copyright reforms as a case study of the issues involved in developing the rule of law in emerging economies  this article argues that western governments and businesses have been misguided in pressuring china to adopt or transplant western style copyright laws  instead  this article argues that  for china to create a more effective system of copyright protections  china should adopt a more rules based approach similar to the copyright regimes of japan and taiwan  
 the golden leash and the fiduciary duty of loyalty in recent years  activist hedge funds have been experimenting with a novel practice in corporate governance  offering their candidates for the board of directors millions of dollars in bonus pay through a device known as a  golden leash   such arrangements  which are highly controversial  award directors for accomplishing activist objectives  an emerging body of work views the golden leash through the same polarized lens as activism itself  either the leash locks directors in to a self serving   short termist  agenda  or it creates incentives for them to be better advocates for shareholders  this binary framing obscures some of the golden leash s most promising qualities  though novel and associated with shareholder activists  the golden leash belongs to a larger class of well established  mainstream legal structures that reduce agency costs and increase expertise at individual firms by  paradoxically  tying directors to multiple firms  these structures include corporate governance innovations in two other areas of the capital markets  the venture capital ecosystem and the practice of corporate directors sharing information with outside entities  like the golden leash  both of these models create overlapping obligations for directors  yet these arrangements are welcomed by scholars  courts  and firms on the grounds that they improve enterprise value and corporate governance by quietly blending loyalties  notwithstanding the fact that they also make conflicts of interest more likely  the golden leash thus follows in a coherent  if unheralded  tradition of structures that forge ultraclose bonds between directors and outside shareholders  this article argues that the risks posed by this blending of duties should be discounted by the availability of mechanisms to manage any conflicts that result and by advantages conferred in capital formation and governance  properly designed and disclosed  the golden leash can promote not only superior returns but consensus building  dialogue  and other values important to sound corporate governance  
 the governance of blockchain financial networks since the emergence of the virtual currency bitcoin in 2009  a new  internet based way of recording entitlements and enforcing rights has increasingly captured the interest of businesses and governments  the technology is commonly called blockchain  and is often associated with a closely related phenomenon  the smart contract   the market is now exploring ways of using these concepts for financial assets  such as securities  fiat money and derivative contracts  this article develops a conceptual framework for the governance of blockchain based networks in financial markets  it constructs a vision of how financial regulation and private law should set the boundaries of this new technology in order to protect market participants and societies at large  while at the same time allowing the necessary room for innovation  
 the great recurrence  karl polanyi and the crises of the european union in his seminal 1944 book the great transformation  polanyi describes the rise and fall of liberal capitalism during the long nineteenth century  many have realised that polanyi has a lot to tell about the european union in the aftermath of the financial crisis  the paper begins with an overview of polanyi s historiography of the failure of nineteenth century liberal capitalism and his account of the four elements that helped liberal capitalism thrive  while precipitating its collapsethe idea of the self regulating market  the gold standard  international peace and liberal constitutionalism  thereafter  the paper describes the particular transformations that these four elements underwent in the course of european integration and after the financial crisis  with a particular focus on the case law of the court of justice  the paper argues that their current constellation has a destructive potential that exceeds the economic dimension of the union and might pave the way for a much greater failure  one that might defeat europe s greatest success  the establishment of peace  ultimately  the paper assesses current reform proposals in light of these insights and makes a number of proposals for re embedding the economy in society  
 the hidden arm of the law  examining administrative justice in gun carry licensing responding to calls to  decenter  american penality beyond the carceral apparatus  this article ethnographically examines administrative process and dissects how it interlocks with criminal justice  to do so  it draws on an admittedly unusual  but theoretically generative  case  administrative gun boards  charged with issuing  denying  revoking  and suspending licenses to conceal carry a firearm  while scholars have examined gun ownership and gun carrying as a social practice  less attention has been paid to gun licensing as a state practice  drawing on observations of over 900 cases from gun board meetings in two counties in michigan  this paper examines how administrative process mimics  supplements  and facilitates criminal justice through three mechanisms  procedural pains  in which administrative process resembles criminal justice  parallel punishment  in which administrative process supplements criminal justice through withholding of benefits  entitlements or licenses  and valve turning  in which administrative process funnels  or threatens to funnel  claimants into the criminal justice system  revealing how administrative process and criminal justice become mutually reinforcing  the findings extend and integrate scholarship that shows the material  symbolic  and psychic implications of criminal justice contact  on the one hand  with the increased tendency of administrative contexts to resemble criminal justice institutions  on the other  
 the history and future of prison psychology prisons are the quintessential government institution  with almost complete control over the lives of the people compelled to spend time in them  depending on how they are run and what services they provide  they have the potential to change people s paths in life for the better or the worse  or indeed to leave people untouched  furthermore  an enormous number of people spend time in prisons  particularly in the united states  so that the impact of imprisonment has serious consequences for society  in this article  we reflect on some of the major influences that psychology has had on prisons and imprisonment  we consider the importance of the scientist practitioner model and the extent to which psychological evidence has permeated prison policy  we illustrate with four examples of how psychologists have contributed to understanding and influencing prisons  the stanford prison experiment  the scientist practitioner work of hans toch  the concepts of legitimacy and procedural justice  and the risk  needs  and responsivity principles of correctional rehabilitation  looking to the future  we imagine how psychologically informed data science could expand its reach  and discuss ways in which prison psychologists could up our game in effectively communicating and embedding the findings of psychological science  
 the housing and planning act 2016  rewarding the aspiration of homeownership  in may 2016 the housing and planning act 2016 became law  the first purely conservative government intervention on housing in england since the 1990s  this article examines the act s key provisions pertaining to social housing and the government s stated aim of increasing rates of homeownership  the act  through the starter homes scheme  extension of the right to buy to housing association tenants and changes to security of tenure in the social sector  has been heralded as a landmark  piece of legislation  this article scrutinises these policy measures and assesses their effectiveness and likely impact  it is contended that the act exposes the government s promotion of homeownership above all other housing tenures  the article further explores the deep moralisation at the heart of the homeownership narrative and the intensification in the residualisation of social housing in england which  it is argued  is the inevitable consequence of the reforms  
 the hunt for truth in comparative law in this response to pierre legrand s dense and provocative account of my differences with james gordley  i express some gratitude for professor legrand s kindness  some dismay at his account of gordley  some uneasiness about the use of literary theory in comparative law  and not least my admiration for legrand s deft and inventive writing  while i gladly acknowledge that there is a kinship between his attitude toward scholarship and my own  i insist that i have by no means given up on the hunt for truth  
 the hyper regulation of public space  the use and abuse of public spaces protection orders in england and wales contemporary state authorities in the united kingdom and elsewhere have increasingly sought to regulate the use of public space  this paper explores through a doctrinal and socio legal analysis how recently introduced public spaces protection orders  pspos  are being used in england and wales to enforce majoritarian sensibilities at the expense of due process and civil liberties  pspos were introduced in october 2014  these orders grant considerable discretion to local authorities to use the threat of criminal sanction to regulate activities in public spaces that they regard as being detrimental to the quality of life of residents  this paper provides the first comprehensive critique of how these orders are used to target minority and vulnerable groups  while curtailing fundamental freedoms  the paper includes suggestions for reforms to make the pspo function in a manner that is more compatible with a rights based approach  
 the icc s office of the prosecutor and the limits of performance indicators performance indicators have long been part of the vocabulary of businesses and public administrations  essentially  they are market oriented tools occupying a central role in both the management and measurement of organizational performance  the present article assesses  in particular  the performance indicators adopted by the international criminal court s  icc  office of the prosecutor  otp   in so doing  it traces the development of such indicators within the otp s strategies  and argues that current indicators do not measure the effectiveness of prosecution in terms of outcomes within conflict affected societies  the article corroborates this argument by explaining how current indicators are inclined to prioritize the economy and efficiency of prosecutions  thus producing a gap in the measurement of effectiveness  the mentioned gap is explained by the otp s fundamental lack of clarity in precisely identifying the outcomes of prosecutions  in turn  the performance indicators adopted by the otp may engender perverse effects  further aggravating the lack of clarity concerning outcomes  the article recommends the adoption of principles aimed at improving future performance measurement of the otp  
 the icj and jus cogens through the lens of feminist legal methods this article explores the persistent gap in receptivity to feminist approaches to public international law within international institutions  using the international court of justice  icj  as an example  the article argues that the icj  as the main judicial organ of the united nations  remains non receptive to feminist analyses of public international law  mainstream public international law  therefore  still has a long way to go before we can affirm that feminist critiques of public international law are fully acknowledged and being addressed  in order to defend this argument  the article analyses the icj s position on the notion of jus cogens  including the dissenting and separate opinions of individual judges  through the lens of feminist legal methods  
 the ideals of the rule of law choices that are underdetermined by reason  such as choices arising from incommensurability among values  involve an element of arbitrariness  and arbitrary choices are commonly thought to be inimical to the rule of law  in this article  i suggest that we should distinguish between two different ideals of the rule of law  and that the arbitrariness of some judicial choices has different implications for these different ideals  one ideal of the rule of law can be understood as  the rule of authority   the other can be understood as  the rule of reason   the latter ideal is opposed to decisions that lack reason  but not to arbitrary choices between undefeated reasons  the arbitrariness involved in choosing between undefeated reasons may be a deficit in one ideal of the rule of law  the rule of authority   but not a deficit in the other  the rule of reason   moreover  it is important to recognise that these are distinct ideals that can conflict  and not rival interpretations of a single ideal  
 the impact of austerity in the framework of corporate rescue and the rights of workers in the eu  a road to recovery  the financial crisis and the sovereign debt crisis have been attributed to a number of causes  whether these are economic  social  cultural or legal  they are all by and large also political  the aim of this article is not to delve into the myriad of heated political arguments that continue to dominate the scene but to assess the impact of the financial crisis on the employment protection rights and the corporate rescue regimes in greece  portugal  france and the uk  in light of the crisis  the rights of the workforce have been severely compromised to afford financially troubled companies a greater opportunity to recover  in order to minimise the catastrophic impact of financial turmoil on their economy and society  all four jurisdictions introduced reforms to their labour codes and corporate rescue mechanisms  often in the name of austerity  this article will offer a snapshot of the changes and their effects and an assessment whether or not the reforms of pre insolvency regimes have operated as an effective embankment for the protection of social and economic welfare  the purpose of this piece is to shed a light on the changes that have occurred and that have affected employment rights in the domestic legal systems of individual member states  as influenced to some extent by the eu in its expectations of improvements to increase labour market flexibility  and whether corporate rescue mechanisms in individual member states are able to provide some counterbalance to the erosion of employment rights generally  copyright  c  2017 insol international and john wiley   sons  ltd  
 the impact of judicial delimitation on private rights existing in contested waters  implications for the somali kenyan maritime dispute this article raises concerns about the impact of judicial delimitation on private exploratory rights existing in contested waters  these concerns stem from the tendency of judges to disregard any non geographic factors during the process of maritime delimitation  this practice allows for the reallocation of the private rights in question and eventually creates tension between public international law and private law  this is discussed in the context of the somali kenyan maritime dispute  which is currently under judicial consideration  the article will demonstrate that  insofar as international judges apply the standard doctrines of delimitation  the prospective judgment may cause the reallocation and  ultimately  the frustration of kenya s private exploratory contracts in the disputed area  it suggests that a unitization agreement entered after delimitation may reverse this outcome  however  inasmuch as state cooperation lacks the cloak of international custom  the interests of private actors operating in contested waters remain at stake  
 the impact of us lng exports and the prospects for price competitiveness in the east asian market us liquefied natural gas  lng  export projects have attracted significant attention and expectations  us lng with a production capacity of over 60 million tonnes per year will be indexed to henry hub prices  henry hub being a natural gas hub in the state of louisiana  america  us lng was regarded as a great way of reducing the lng import cost to asian importers which were experiencing increased lng import costs  rocketing lng import costs resulted from rapid demand growth and high international lng prices in the early 2010s and motivated discussions about delinkage of lng prices from crude oil prices among asian importers  increased domestic oil production led to the fall of the us crude oil imports  which brought down the crude oil price in the international market  oil price falls resulted in a disappearance of the price advantage of us lng over traditional crude oil indexed lng  price competitiveness of us lng will be weakened if henry hub prices go up  under the current low oil price market environment  the most notable influence of us lng exports into the asia pacific market is a strengthening of competition  resulting from large volumes of lng supply within a relatively short period of time  in conjunction with australian lng projects rather than the impact of the introduction of the new henry hub pricing system and its possible replacement of the existing oil indexation pricing system  the true meaning of a consumer   fair price  based on gas to gas competition will only be achieved by the creation of functioning regional liquid natural gas or an lng hub in asia  
 the implementation of the nagoya abs protocol for the research sector  experience and challenges over the years  researchers in public institutions and universities have accessed genetic materials from a variety of sources  freely exchanged them with fellow researchers and institutions and shared their research results with foreign and local collaborators  the 2010 nagoya protocol regulating access to genetic resources is set to change this scenario  this treaty requires country parties to put in place enhanced abs measures regulating access to their genetic resources and to provide for the sharing of benefits arising from their utilization  these measures include minimum access standards  mandatory prior informed consent of indigenous and local communities  compliance with the domestic laws or requirements of the provider country and monitoring the utilization of genetic resources  this is aimed at commercial research  non commercial public research which contributes to the conservation and sustainable use of biological diversity is encouraged  particularly in developing countries  through simplified measures  there are undoubtedly practical challenges in operationalizing this provision without impeding research in the sector most potentially affected by abs measures  this article presents the results of a survey of the practices of such researchers in one developing country  namely malaysia  it examines the potential implications for the national implementation of the protocol  given country specificities  this study highlights and shows the importance of increasing knowledge about existing practices for an efficient design and implementation by developing countries of a complex legislation such as the nagoya abs protocol  
 the implications of brexit for uk competition law and policy brexit raises particular issues for competition law and policy because it is a field in which the european commission is a major direct actor  and where national authorities with the uk s playing a notably strong role operate in a european network  to foster public debate and inform government policy  the authors established the brexit competition law working group  and the article that follows is the text of their final report of july 2017  the report has two main themes  first  brexit should not jeopardise the legislative or institutional continuity of uk competition law  the main pillars of uk competition law the competition act 1998 and the enterprise act 2002 do not require radical reform because of brexit  though some amendments will be needed  the second theme  however  is the problematic nature of transition to the environment post brexit  and of how to secure effective international coordination and cooperation within it  with an end to the  one stop shop  for merger assessment  the demands on the uk s competition and markets authority could rise sharply  and unless its resources and capabilities are enhanced  uk competition policy could be weakened just when it needs strengthening  
 the importance of narrative in the negotiation of host government agreements for lng projects  the case of british columbia and petronas this article identifies some elements of a conceptual framework that host governments can use to measure and manage their bargaining power in discussions with international energy companies concerning the development of new lng projects  the idea of a  negotiation narrative  is introduced to explain how the parties marshal and apply their respective bargaining power factors during negotiations  an account of the recent discussions between british columbia and petronas is presented as a case study to highlight the importance of narrative in the negotiation process  the resulting host government agreement between british columbia and petronas is reviewed  and the contractual mechanisms used  or not used  in that agreement are compared against model agreements and agreements in other jurisdictions  the article concludes that a host government that loses control of its own negotiation narrative will inevitably find its bargaining power severely diminished  resulting in an agreement that gives priority to corporate over public interests  
 the income equality case for eliminating the estate tax the estate tax and income tax rules independently attempt to either promote or deter different behaviors  the interaction of these different rules often leads to disparate or unintended consequences to taxpayers  for example  achieving an overall lower effective tax rate by paying more estate tax to lower the income tax rate  this overlay of the estate tax rules on the income tax rules is a key problem at the core of our tax system  yet  few scholars focus on this topic  in this article  i document the actual behavior of the trust and estate bar  by looking at how attorneys approach the intersection of estate and income taxes  i demonstrate deficiencies in the current scholarly belief  which is based largely on anecdotal information  that the wealthy have a preference for paying less or no estate tax  i show the real world preferences that indicate wealthy taxpayers are paying high levels of estate tax to minimize the income tax incidents  after showing the shift of preferences and the resulting overall tax loss to the fisc  the article then proposes useful policy solutions  such as elimination of the estate tax or using death as an income tax triggering event  
 the indivisibility of human rights this article defends a novel  normative conception of the indivisibility of human rights  human rights are indivisible because normative commitment to one mutually entails normative commitment to another  the normative conception enables us to defend three important theoretical and practical corollaries  first  as a conceptual thesis normative indivisibility lets us see how human rights constitute a unified system not liable to the typical counter examples to indivisibility as mutual indispensability  second  as a dialectical thesis  normative indivisibility can support linkage arguments in defense of controversial human rights  and third  as a political thesis  normative indivisibility can show why the political thesis of indivisibility means that states lack discretion to  pick and choose  which human rights to implement  
 the inevitability and indeterminacy of game theoretic accounts of legal order how is legal order possible  why do people comply with law when it prevents themfrom doing what they think best  two important books show how these questions canand from some methodological perspectives mustbe answered in the form of game theoretic accounts that show how legal compliance can be compatible with the broad self interest of officials and citizens  unfortunately  however  these books also serve to demonstrate that game theoretic accounts along these lines lack the resources to explain how real world legal systems emerge and evolve or the various institutional shapes these systems take  the fundamental limitation of game theory  in this context and more generally  is its inability to predict or explain the size and shape of cooperative equilibria  
 the international criminal court and the celebici test in the katanga and bemba trial judgments  the international criminal court was faced with the problem of how to resolve cumulative convictions based on the same set of facts  the court decided to adopt the celebici test  which was developed and applied predominantly by the ad hoc international tribunals and based on us case law  the present article challenges the suitability of this test in international criminal law  pointing out the problems it raises in international and national criminal law  in this regard  evidence is furnished that this test is not prevailing in the united states supreme court case law  and other tests and principles used in domestic criminal law are examined  ultimately  a test meant to address the possible breach of the ne bis in idem principle cannot rely exclusively on speciality and implementing additional principles such as consumption or subsidiarity may enhance international standards  adding much needed nuances in the intricate task of determining separateness of offences  
 the international criminal court in cote d ivoire the trial of former ivorian president laurent gbagbo at the international criminal court  icc  has provoked major controversy in c remove te d ivoire and the wider ivorian diaspora  while both pro gbagbo and pro ouattara sides reportedly committed abuses during the 2010 2011 crisis  the icc prosecutor pursued a sequenced prosecutorial strategy  critics deplore the alleged lack of perceived impartiality in this approach  this article provides a critical assessment of this strategy and offers a novel theoretical framework to glean new findings around the norm of prosecutorial impartiality  first  the controversy around the prosecutor s strategy arguably reveals a tension between a  legalist  and a  political  vision of impartiality  while the prosecutor s strategy is in accordance with the legalist vision  its actions are criticized based on the political vision  the dispute between the prosecutor and her critics thus reflects the tension between being impartial and being seen as impartial  or between the demands of procedural impartiality and political neutrality  secondly  the office of the prosecutor s  otp  approach to the c remove te d ivoire situation is arguably the product of a  tactical rapport  between the otp and the government  i e  of the relationship between the tactics used by the otp to operate as an effective prosecutorial body and the tactics used by national authorities to navigate the post crisis transition  
 the international criminal court s strategies in relation to victims the international criminal court s  icc or  court   2012 revised strategy in relation to victims   revised strategy   sets out a generally ambitious vision to give effect to the rights of victims in the rome statute  however  with an increasing number of complex situations  severe budget pressures and continued uncertainty about the court s approach to participation and reparation  the objectives are presented as aspirations and the strategy is vague on how they will be achieved  almost five years later  the revised strategy has been only partially incorporated into the strategic plan of the court for 2013 2017  plans to evaluate and update it have been postponed  despite the committed work of many parts of the court  it continues to struggle in a number of areas and new challenges have arisen with the triggering of the court s reparation mandate in its first cases  this article considers the challenges that the icc has faced in developing and implementing strategies in relation to victims  and finds that the court is falling well short of giving effect to the rights of victims in the statute in all situations and cases  it identifies major gaps in the court s strategic approach and makes the case for the court to urgently develop a new comprehensive and coherent court wide strategy applying a reparative justice framework  
 the international law commission s draft articles on the protection of persons in the event of disasters  codification  progressive development or creation of law from thin air  this article concerns the ilc s draft articles on the protection of persons in the event of disasters and  in particular  the establishment of a rights duties relationship between states concerning the right to accept or refuse assistance from third states  horizontal rights duties relationship   the article assesses the merits of the horizontal rights duties relationship by assessing the two primary justifications for the proposition  the first justification is that the proposition reflects the law as it currently stands  the second justification is that  independent of whether the proposition reflects current law  it is morally required in order to save lives and protect the dignity of persons affected by disasters  the assessment is undertaken  principally  on the basis of the materials relied upon in the commentary to the draft articles as well as deliberations within the ilc itself  
 the internet of things and potential remedies in privacy tort law the internet of things  iot  is an intriguing digital phenomenon in technology that creates many legal challenges as the world becomes more interconnected through the internet  by creating a connected system  the iot links a network of physical objects  like consumer devices  and enables these devices to communicate and exchange data  in the very near future  almost every consumer device  from cars to  a coffee mug  may connect through the internet  the iot has incredible potential to better society by providing immense amounts of rich sensory data for analytics and other uses  nevertheless  there are also many latent dangers that could manifest as the iot proliferates  including privacy violations and security risks  the legal scholarship surrounding privacy issues with respect to the iot is currently underdeveloped  this note adds to the discussion of privacy law by analyzing the legal repercussions of the iot and its relationship to privacy tort law  it summarizes the foundations of privacy law and current regulations that apply to the iot and concludes that current laws and regulations provide limited remedies for consumers harmed by the iot  it then provides a potential solution by suggesting that two privacy torts  the public disclosure of private facts tort and the intrusion upon seclusion tort  can provide partial civil remedies for those consumers  each of the two privacy torts has evolved in different ways since its creation  and this note explores the advantages and disadvantages of both  finally  this note advocates for the expanded use and revitalization of these privacy torts through judicial application in iot cases as a potential strategy for regulating the iot  
 the inventory of callous unemotional traits  psychometric properties among referred and non referred portuguese female juveniles the presence of callous unemotional  cu  traits delineates a subgroup of male youth with severe conduct disorder and antisocial behavior  but little research has been done among female youth  drawing on 377 female adolescents  103 selected from forensic settings and 274 selected from school settings  from portugal  the current study is the first to simultaneously examine the psychometric properties of the inventory of callous unemotional traits  icu  in incarcerated female youth and community youth  the results support the use of the icu in terms of its factor structure  and internal consistency despite the fact an item had to be removed from the callousness dimension  statistically significant positive associations were found with measures of psychopathic traits and aggression  as well as non significant associations with empathy and social anxiety  significant associations were also found with several indicators of delinquent careers including age of criminal onset  age of first contact with the law  conduct disorder symptoms and diagnosis  crime seriousness  previous violent offending  number of criminal charges  alcohol use  and drug use  findings are discussed in terms of the use of the icu among female juvenile offenders and community youths   c  2017 elsevier ltd  all rights reserved  
 the job market for justice  screening and selecting candidates for the international court of justice over the past few decades  states have granted greater independence and authority to international courts  yet still retain their ability to control who sits on the bench  this article examines how governments use their power of judicial nomination and appointment in the context of the international court of justice  icj  and assesses the relative influence of three factors on states  vote choices for icj candidates  the candidates  probability of  in sensitivity to political considerations  their qualifications  and the role of interstate politics  drawing on a new dataset of candidates nominated for election to the icj between 1949 and 2010  we demonstrate that electing states base their initial vote choices largely on the same set of factors within both bodies that elect icj judges  the united nations general assembly and security council  in particular  professional experiences signaling a probability of insensitivity to political considerations reduce a candidate s expected vote share  a candidate s qualifications  on the other hand  do not appear to make a considerable difference in winning more votes  finally  the amount of support during the nomination stage is highly correlated with vote share  suggesting that considerable screening occurs prior to nomination and that the number of nominations received facilitates co ordination of vote choice across states  
 the judgment of the grand chamber dated 21 december 2016 in the two joint tele2 sverige and watson cases  the need for a harmonised legal framework on the retention of data at eu level as a follow up to the digital rights judgment of 8 april 2014 in which the grand chamber invalidated the data retention directive  the administrative court of appeal in stockholm and the court of appeal in london both referred questions to the court of justice for a preliminary ruling  on 21 december 2016  the grand chamber rendered a landmark judgment in which it interpreted article 15 1  of e privacy directive 2002 58 ec dated 12 july 2002 in light of article 7 on the right to privacy  article 8 on the protection of personal data  article 11 on freedom of expression and article 52 1  on the principle of proportionality of the charter of fundamental rights  the grand chamber ruled that eu law does not allow a general and indiscriminate retention of all traffic and location data  it also ruled that access of competent national authorities to retained data must be restricted solely to fighting serious crime and subject to prior review by a court or an independent administrative authority   c  2017 xavier tracol  published by elsevier ltd  all rights reserved  
 the jury as a translation of democratic participation and political conflict in this response to valerie hans s presidential address  i use her legal translating term to argue that the implementation of liberal democratic structures in new democracies opens new opportunities to translate the jury system into and onto new democratic societies  while policy makers have concerns about the strength and vibrancy of lay participation in the legal system  policy makers  decisions to adopt trial by jury are not always democratic  nonetheless  the consequence of the translation of trial by jury furthers democratic development  using nicaragua  mexico  and russia as case studies  i suggest that one goal of policy makers who attempt to adopt trial by jury is to reduce the discretionary power of judges who remain from the prior government  comparative trial by jury research can contribute more to our understanding of democratic development than prior research has indicated  
 the known unknown  in search for a legal structure of the significance criterion of the siec test this article establishes the thesis that the notion of  significant  in the siec test of the european merger control regulation lacks a clear legal concept in the current decisional practice  antitrust economists and authorities have developed a set of theories of harm and have constantly refined them  yet these theories often do not explain when certain price effects or other implications of a merger have reached an intensity that is  significant  in the meaning of article 2 eu merger regulation  eumr   1  this renders the notion of significance a  known unknown  in legal terms  it is argued here that this legal uncertainty as to the relevant definition of  significant  has led to an increase in discretion in the handling of merger cases  a bias toward the detrimental effects of mergers  and a deflation of potential efficiency considerations  the article purports that  as a consequence  mergers are often treated similarly to cartels in concentrating on the elimination of competition and regarding efficiencies as a rare exemption for which the parties carry the burden of proof  against this background  it shall be attempted to construe a unitary concept of significance that integrates efficiency analysis and includes a differentiated allocation of the burdens of proof for procompetitive and anticompetitive effects of mergers  
 the law of abolition three themes have characterized death penalty abolition throughout the western world  a sustained period of de facto abolition  an understanding of those in government that the death penalty implicates human rights  and a willingness of those in government to defy popular support for the death penalty  the first two themes are present in the u s   what remains is for the u s  supreme court to manifest a willingness to act against the weight of public opinion and to live up to history s demands  when the supreme court abolishes the death penalty  it will be traveling a well worn road  this essay gathers  for the first time and all in one place  the opinions of judges who have advocated abolition of the death penalty over the past half century  and suggests  through this  law of abolition   what a supreme court decision invalidating the death penalty might look like  although no one can know for sure how history will judge the death penalty  odds are good that the death penalty will come to be seen as one of the worst indignities our nation has ever known and that a supreme court decision abolishing it will  in time  be widely accepted as right  
 the law of the test  performance based regulation and diesel emissions control the volkswagen diesel emissions scandal of 2015 not only pushed that company s stock and retail sales into freefall  but also raised serious questions about the efficacy of existing regulatory controls  the same furtive actions taken by volkswagen had been taken nearly twenty years earlier by other firms in the diesel industry  in that previous scandal  the u s  environmental protection agency  epa  discovered that diesel truck engine manufacturers had  like volkswagen would later do  programmed on board computers to calibrate their engines one way to satisfy the required emissions test but then to re calibrate automatically to achieve better fuel economy and responsiveness when the trucks were on the road  even though doing so increased emissions above the mandated level  this article provides an in depth retrospective study of the federal government s efforts to regulate diesel emissions  in particular  it chronicles the earlier saga over heavy duty diesel truck engines to reveal important lessons for regulators who use a regulatory strategy known as performance based regulation  endorsed around the world and used in many settings  performance based regulation mandates the attainment of outcomes the passing of a test but leaves the means for doing so up to the regulated entities  in theory  performance standards are highly appealing  but their actual performance in practice has remained virtually unstudied by scholars of regulation  this article s extensive analysis of u s  diesel emissions control provides a new basis to learn how performance based regulation works in action  revealing some of its previously unacknowledged limitations  precisely because performance based regulation offers flexibility  it facilitates  if not invites  private sector firms to innovate in ways that allow them to pass mandated tests while confounding regulators  broader policy objectives  when regulating the diesel industry or any other aspect of the economy  policymakers should temper their enthusiasm for performance standards and  when they use them  maintain constant vigilance for private sector tactics that run counter to proper regulatory goals  
 the law school library or the library at the law school  how lessons from other types of libraries can inform the evolution of the academic law library in the digital age academic law libraries must adapt to the new digital environment of reduced funds  smaller physical collections  and greater use of electronic resources  this article examines the historical development of academic law libraries and the current challenges they face  different approaches libraries take to change  and lessons about how to thrive from nonlaw libraries  
 the leadership imperative  a collaborative approach to professional development in the global age of more for less notwithstanding the increasing importance of technology  the practice of corporate law is and is likely to remain for the foreseeable future a human capital business  as a result  law firms must continue to attract  develop  and retain talented lawyers  unfortunately  the traditional approach  which divides responsibility for professional development among law schools  which are supposed to teach students to think like a lawyer  law firms  which are expected to train associates to  be  lawyers  and corporate clients  whose job it is to foot the bill  is no longer well aligned to the current realities of the marketplace  in this article  we document the causes for this misalignment and propose a new model of professional development in which law schools  law firms  and corporate clients collaborate to train lawyers to be lifelong learners in the full range of technical  professional  and network building skills they will need to flourish throughout their careers  we offer specific proposals for how to achieve this realignment and confront the resistance that will inevitably greet any attempt to do so  
 the legal history of the banking union this article provides a brief legal history of the banking union since the first steps towards a single financial market in the mid 1970s  it identifies four phases of legal and institutional evolution before the banking union  while reflecting the spirit of the time in the approach to market integration  each phase is defined by the equilibrium reached between the expansion of european competences and the safeguarding of national sovereignty  the transition from an equilibrium to another was made by introducing legal and institutional innovations to deepen integration  such innovations were often at the boundaries of what could be achieved under the treaty  the banking union  which comprises thus far the single supervisory mechanism and the single resolution mechanism  follows the same pattern  its design is the outcome  on the one hand  of the legal possibilities offered by the treaty and  on the other  of the tension between european competences and national sovereignty  as concluded at the end  it encapsulates many of the trends in european integration since the financial crisis erupted in 2007  
 the legality of downgrading nationally determined contributions under the paris agreement  lessons from the us disengagement in this analysis piece  we consider a legal question that generated much debate in the lead up to the us decision to withdraw from the paris agreement  can a party downgrade its nationally determined contribution  ndc  to climate mitigation without running afoul of its treaty commitments  drawing on the treaty interpretation methods set out in the vienna convention on the law of treaties  we examine the paris agreement s normative framework and analyse the provision on adjustment of ndcs  we show that  while ndcs as such are not legally binding  they are subject to binding procedural requirements and to normative expectations of progression and highest possible ambition  read together  these binding and non binding terms make plain that a party would contravene the spirit of the paris agreement if it downgraded an existing ndc  the us federal government is already scaling back its domestic climate action  such that it is unlikely to meet its ndc  its paris withdrawal  however  can only be formally declared in 2019 and will not take effect until 2020  we consider how  during this interim period  the legal implications of the  withdrawal  approach differ from those of the  stay and downgrade  approach  
 the limitations of supply chain disclosure regimes although the past few decades have seen numerous cases of human rights violations within corporate supply chains  companies are frequently not held accountable for the abuses because there is a significant governance gap in the regulation of corporate activity abroad  in response  governments have begun to pass mandatory disclosure laws that require companies to release detailed information on their supply chains in the hopes that these laws will either provoke companies to reform their practices themselves or create pressure from stakeholders to improve corporate accountability  in this article  we argue that supply chain disclosure regimes are unlikely to have a large effect on consumer behavior  and  as a result  their effectiveness at reducing human rights abuses will likely be limited  this is not only because scholarship on mandatory disclosure regimes in other areas has suggested that these regimes are frequently unsuccessful  but also because these problems are likely to be exacerbated in the human rights context  we argue that this is due to the fact that supply chain disclosures do not provide information on actual products  the information in the disclosures only provides weak proxies for human rights outcomes  and the risks associated with supply chains vary dramatically across industries  in order to test our argument  we field a series of experiments that were designed to test how well consumers understand supply chain disclosures  in our experiments  the nationally representative sample of respondents consistently rated disclosures reporting low levels of due diligence almost as highly as disclosures that reported a high level of due diligence  based on these results  we argue that supply chain disclosure regimes designed to change consumer behavior in order to reduce corporate human rights abuses should be reconsidered  
 the limits of socio legal radicalism  social and legal studies and third world scholarship in this review to mark the 25th anniversary of social and legal studies  sls   we offer an assessment of the evolution of socio legal scholarship on the third world  we seek to locate the journal in the broader history of socio legal studies and legal education in the united kingdom and to consider its engagement with the work of third world scholars  in order to do this  we recall the founding commitment of the journal s first editorial board to non western perspectives on law and locate this commitment both historically and biographically  we explore a number of important interventions concerned with socio legal studies in the third world  but also point to significant gaps and omissions since 1992  to end  we argue for a reassertion of sls s founding commitments to anti imperial scholarship and the challenges posed by critical  non western perspectives  
 the medical licensing examination debate national licensing examinations are typically large scale examinations taken early in a career or near the point of graduation  and  importantly  success is required to subsequently be able to practice  they are becoming increasingly popular as a method of quality assurance in the medical workforce  but debate about their contribution to patient safety and the improvement of healthcare outcomes continues  a systematic review of the national licensing examination literature demonstrates that there is disagreement between assessment experts about the strengths and challenges of licensing examinations  this is characterized by a trans atlantic divide between the dominance of psychometric reliability assurance in north america and the wider interpretations of validity  to include consequences  in europe  we conclude that the debate might benefit from refocusing to what a national licensing examination should assess  to achieve a balance between assessing a breadth of skills and the capacity for such skills in practice  and focusing less on reproducibility  
 the misguided quest for regulatory stability in the renewable energy sector regulatory stability is usually identified as the key factor to attract investments in any sector  in the energy sector  the exceptional level and pace of investments required by the transition towards the low carbon economy have led to an almost exclusive focus on measures which could increase regulatory stability  this article argues that both the goal of regulatory stability and the means to obtain it are badly in need of clarification  a case study of renewable energy regulation in italy shows that regulatory stability cannot be equated with a ban on retrospective regulatory intervention  moreover  neither national nor international litigation on retrospective cuts to renewable energy supports schemes help improve the quality of regulation  what is needed is a range of procedural and substantive regulatory measures allowing states to credibly commit to a long term strategy for renewable energy  in the european union  eu   procedural measures hinge on the new national energy and climate plans  to be adopted in the framework of eu governance  and on regional cooperation on targets and support schemes  the substantive measures include innovative financial instruments and alternative ways to manage disputes  
 the morality of divestment divestment from companies that produce or heavily utilize fossil fuels has become one of the biggest issues in the contemporary moral debate surrounding climate change  universities and other institutions are being asked to divest themselves of their fossil fuel related investments  in this article i argue that  while the case for divestment is morally strong  not all of the arguments used to support divestment are equally strong  moreover  which of these arguments is employed matters a great deal for the strength of the conclusions regarding divestment  there are two major groups of arguments  what i call positive arguments for divestment  which stem from the claim that divestment is a response to general duties to take action to prevent dangerous climate change  and what i call negative arguments  which stem from a duty not to cause harm  in this article i will briefly characterize what divestment means and to whom it applies  i will then look at negative and positive duty accounts of the duty to divest before looking at the standard objections to both  objections have tended to cohere around the claims that divesting is inconsistent  useless and or harmful  or should be abandoned for better options to avoid dangerous climate change  
 the mysterious case of disappearing family law and the shrinking vulnerable subject  the shifting sands of family law s jurisdiction this article seeks to critically examine the implications that the new eligibility requirements for legal aid as implemented by the legal aid  sentencing and punishment of offenders act 2012 are having on the ways in which private family law governs families  it makes use of a theoretical lens drawn from the work of valverde  2009  2014a  2014b  on jurisdiction  to map the shift that has taken place within family law as a result of the political boundary that the act has drawn between vulnerable  litigants eligible for legal aid and the rest of families engaging with private family law  for whom self sufficiency and responsibility is encouraged and expected  it argues that in reserving legal aid for a narrow group of vulnerable litigants  the formal scale of family law has shrunk  there being at the same time an increased reliance on more informal sources of law such as advice based resources  this has led to a diversification of formal and informal scales of governance which operate according to different logics   which impact negatively on access to family justice for families from various backgrounds and circumstances  the article concludes with a call for family law researchers to be mindful of the need to look at both formal and more informal sources of family law in order to fully appreciate developments within the jurisdiction  particularly pernicious ones  and to be able to respond to them appropriately  
 the myth of cypriot bank resolution  success   a plea for a more holistic and less costly supervision   resolution approach this paper advocates for actively minimising the price of bank resolution at each part of the new regulatory banking structure  it does so by examining how the banking resolution costs were increased due to decisions taken at different stages of the regime during the experience of cyprus with bank supervision  early intervention  resolution and liquidation  the paper then moves on to argue that increasing instead of decreasing the lingering bank resolution costs in cyprus tainted the picture of bank resolution success for which the cypriot experience has become somewhat of a posterchild  it argues that if the success of bank resolution is evaluated after a series of bad supervisory decisions  it is more than likely to conclude that resolution was successful because it resolved a very detrimental situation  simply put  the success of the cypriot bank resolution might as well equate to a gigantic failure of bank supervision  as such  while acknowledging the benefits and successes of the new regime  this paper tries to showcase that the application of the supervisory and resolution regime in cyprus hides a lot of elements that are very far from successful  but which can nevertheless form constructive lessons for the practical application of the regime in the future  
 the nature and significance of the right to bodily integrity this article seeks to explain and explore the concept of bodily integrity  the concept is often elided with autonomy in the case law and the academic literature  it argues that bodily integrity is non reducible to the principle of autonomy  bodily integrity relates to the integration of the self and the rest of the objective world  a breach of it  therefore  is significantly different to inteference in decisions about your body  this explains why interference with bodily integrity requires justification beyond what will suffice for an interference with autonomy  it also explores how this understanding of bodily integrity assists in understanding disability  gender and separated bodily material  
 the nature of the crimes in the african criminal court this article examines the distinction between  international  and  transnational  crimes in contemporary international legal literature  it considers this traditional division through the lens of the african union  au   s malabo protocol  adopted in june 2014  which seeks to establish the first regional penal court with material jurisdiction over 14 crimes  the author argues that  while the international  transnational crimes distinction may be analytically convenient for scholars  the codification of both types of prohibitions into a regional treaty illustrates that some states are less concerned about adherence to crime categories and more interested in proscribing whatever conduct pose threats to their peace and security  while the malabo protocol has been controversial  because it is among other things perceived as an outcome of africa s backlash against the international criminal court and for its temporary immunity provision shielding sitting government officials from prosecutions  it is submitted that the merits of the au instrument must be assessed on criteria other than whether it retains the conventional distinction between transnational and international crimes  
 the negative effect fallacy  a case study of incorrect statistical reasoning by federal courts this article examines the negative effect fallacy  a flawed statistical argument first utilized by the warren court in elkins v  united states  the court argued that empirical evidence could not determine whether the exclusionary rule prevents future illegal searches and seizures because it is never easy to prove a negative  inappropriately conflating the philosophical and arithmetic definitions of the word negative  subsequently  the court has repeated this mistake in other domains  including free speech  voting rights  and campaign finance  the fallacy has also proliferated into the federal circuit and district court levels  narrowly  our investigation aims to eradicate the use of the negative effect fallacy in federal courts  more broadly  we highlight several challenges and concerns with the increasing use of statistical reasoning in court decisions  as courts continue to evaluate statistical and empirical questions  we recommend that they evaluate the evidence on its own merit rather than relying on convenient arguments embedded in precedent  
 the new french law of contract the article analyses the recent reform of contract law in france  the section of the civil code on the law of contract was amended and restructured in its entirety last year  the revised section came into force on 1 october 2016  the article considers its main innovations and compares them with the corresponding principles of english law and some contract law international instruments  mainly the unidroit principles and the principles of european contract law  the article also assesses whether the new provisions achieve their stated aim of rendering french contract law more accessible  predictable  influential abroad and commercially attractive  
 the new global strategy for the eu s foreign and security policy at a time of human rights crises this article explores whether the global strategy for the eu s foreign and security policy adds new significance to the human rights commitment spelled out in eu treaties and elaborated in other sectoral  strategic documents  in particular  it investigates whether the strategy s take on human rights continues or complements the union s earlier approach in the field or prioritises them in the union s activities  the article commences with an identification of the modalities through which the new strategy voices human rights both as values and objectives in eu external policies  this is done against the background of coherence and resilience as organising concepts of the union s external action and the global strategy itself  it goes on to draw from our research findings of three case studies as focused on the eu human rights and rule of law failure at home  poland and hungary   at its borders  in relation to migration   and in its closest vicinity  ukraine   these serve as the background for the analysis of how the pursuit of human rights objectives is continued  complemented or prioritised against the background of and with the use of the two foundational concepts  it is contended that coherence and resilience advance  if at times modestly  the existing eu human rights agenda  continuing earlier approaches  for example  ensuring a comprehensive human rights approach to conflict and crisis  or complementing them  for example  using and investing in all instruments aimed at conflict prevention  management  resolution and stabilisation  connecting the internal and external spheres and policies   the migration policyremains a problematic one  as the implementation of the rhetorical commitment to the prioritisation of human rights does not stand trial with the general atmosphere in european and world politics  
 the numerus clausus of sex there is a fundamental revolution under way regarding the relationship between gender and the state  both domestically and internationally  across the world  the rise and visibility of transgender rights movements have forced a persistent rethinking of the cornerstone legal presumptions associated with science  sex  and gender  as many people  along with multiple courts  colleges  and workplaces  now recognize  the binary presumptions of male and female identity are largely outdated and often fail to capture the complexity of identity and expression  the question for legal scholars and legislatures is how the law can and should respond to this complexity  taking this observation as an invitation  this article provides a different way to conceive of the relationship between sex and gender that might provide another vantage point in  demonstrating the limits of our jurisprudence  drawing on professor cheryl harris s groundbreaking article exploring whiteness as property published in the harvard law review over twenty years ago  this article argues that  in order to understand the relationship between sex and gender  it might be helpful to explore a parallel type of affiliation between identity  property  and intellectual property  my thesis is that sex is to gender as property is to intellectual property  unpacking this further  this article argues that  instead of thinking of sex as a construct of biology alone  it might be helpful for us to reconceptualize state assignedsex along the lines of tangible property bordered  seemingly fixed  rivalrous  and premised on a juridical presumption of scarcity in terms of its rigid polarities of male and female  in contrast  regarding gender  i argue that thinking through gender as a performance  if taken seriously  also suggests that gender is more akin to intellectual property permeable  malleable  unfixed  nonrivalrous and ultimately deeply nonexclusive  normatively  i argue that a model of gender pluralism is an important framework with which to examine the importance of gender diversity and fluidity  
 the opportunities and limitations of neutral carbon tariffs because carbon taxes can lead to loss of competitiveness  applying tariffs on imports from non carbon restricting countries helps address the cost disadvantage faced by producers in carbon restricting countries  such tariffs  known as border carbon adjustments  bcas   can also help reduce possible carbon  leakage   or the growth in foreign emissions due to increased production of carbon intensive goods in non carbon restricting countries  we demonstrate that bcas that do not exceed the burdens imposed by carbon taxation on domestic like products could be consistent with world trade organization  wto  rules  however   neutral   i e   nondiscriminatory  bcas might still be inefficiently high from a global welfare perspective  this stems from the misaligned focus of bcas on imports rather than production the real cause of emissions  the discrepancy between neutrality and efficiency enables carbon restricted industries to seek inefficiently high bcas  recognition of this discrepancy strengthens the case for multilateral alternatives that curb global carbon emissions  
 the ordered apology psychological research has demonstrated that an apology can contribute to the well being of the receiver of the apology  however  the legal community has only cautiously embraced the idea of claiming and ordering apologies in a legal procedure  the conventional wisdom is that apologies that are claimed or ordered do not serve a purpose because they lack sincerity and violate the right to freedom of expression  this article challenges conventional wisdom by demonstrating that apologies do not need to be sincere in order for them to serve a purpose  based on available empirical research  case law and scholarly research on apologies  this article identifies the purposes of coerced apologies and uses these purposes to draft criteria for determining when ordered apologies are appropriate  it is concluded that an ordered apology is a fulfilment of a legal requirement rather than a statement of genuinely held feelings  a proportionality test is proposed and developed in order to determine the permissibility of ordered apologies  the findings refute the sincerity myth  offer suggestions as to how to overcome freedom of expression concerns and call for a more welcoming approach towards the ordered apology  
 the other face of eurolegalism  the multifaceted convergence of national enforcement styles this article analyzes the implications of european integration for national regulatory enforcement  more specifically  it tests the eurolegalism thesis  which holds that the tendency of using more detailed  prescriptive european union  eu  regulation combined with more public and private enforcement leads to a convergence in national enforcement styles  it does so by developing and applying a fine grained conceptualization of enforcement style  this conceptualization forms the basis of a focused comparison of enforcement of the highly detailed and strict eu packaging waste directive in the netherlands and germany   two countries known for their opposed enforcement styles  our analysis shows that although convergence toward a more insistent enforcement style seems to have taken place  the two countries have arrived at this position in markedly different ways  by identifying differences in style underneath the surface of convergence  the article qualifies the eurolegalism argument  thus  advancing the literature on eu enforcement styles and deepening our understanding of the subtle and divergent ways in which common international regulatory inputs may affect domestic enforcement  
 the ownership of clearinghouses  when  skin in the game  is not enough  the remutualization of clearinghouses a central question for corporate law scholarship  has revolved around the ownership structure of enterprises  why are some businesses owned by employees  some by customers  and some by investors  until now  the question has centered on the relative benefits offered to these stakeholders by one form or another  this article explores how ownership structure can be a matter of public importance for financial stability  and proves that it is so by delving into an institution of immense importance and timeliness  the clearinghouse  a critical financial market infrastructure  clearinghouses process  settle  and guarantee the performance of several trillion dollars in securities and derivatives trades daily  by operating as central counterparties  they act as private stability mechanisms  reducing counterparty credit risk and sharing default risk among their members  clearinghouses achieve this result via a unique economic structure  which includes a double layer of capital  the traditional equity capital and the so called mutual guaranty fund  the clearinghouse s loss sharing fund   historically  clearinghouses have been mutual enterprises owned by their members  users   who contributed to the firm s mutual guaranty fund  but most clearinghouses have recently demutualized their ownership structure  opening their equity capital to external investors and transforming into for profit public corporations  while keeping members on the hook for losses  this structural evolution has catalyzed new agency costs between the now coexisting and  competing  stakeholders  members and external shareholders  these costs  which have been further exacerbated by the post crisis systemic role of clearinghouses  are exemplified by shareholders with control and economicrights but limited  skin in the game   and members who bear the final risk and losses if things go south  but who have no control or monitoring rights  this article identifies how the agency costs between members and shareholders threaten the financial stability of clearinghouses and argues that aligning control and monitoring rights with final risk bearing costs is the path clearinghouses should follow to achieve a more resilient ownership and governance structure  
 the participatory class action the class action has emerged as the settlement instrument of choice in mass harm cases such as the volkswagen emissions scandal or the deepwater horizon after math  but the class action has also reemerged in the mass tort context  most notably in the nfl concussion litigation  after seemingly collapsing following the amchem and ortiz supreme court decisions of the 1990s  the class action device is getting an important second life in courts today   para   para this article argues that the new class action has a feature that should increase its doctrinal acceptability  forms of active class member participation  what we term the  participatory class action  emerges from two developments  the first is the technological transformation in the means of communication with class members  and among the class members themselves  the second is that the current class action almost invariably arises from the initial aggregation and centralization of large numbers of individual suits and putative class actions in the multidistrict litigation  mdl  process  as a result  classes are comprised not simply of lawyers and absent class members  but of hundreds or even thousands of individual claims  with individuals capable of monitoring the class and represented by independent counsel   para   para with over forty percent of the actively litigated civil cases in federal courts now in the mdl dockets  the transformation in mass resolution is well underway  in these new consolidations  the assumptions of older law about absent class member passivity break down  in the popular typology in academic examination of class actions  class action law should insist on the loyalty of agents and the importance of individual ability to exit as guarantors of systemic legitimacy  in the participatory class action  voice emerges as a critical element  with the capacity of the normally silent class members to assert their interests and their views  as with the need for class action law to move from first class mail to twitter  so too must the law embrace the implications of real participation by those represented in the assessment of representational propriety  
 the phoenix of colonial war  race  the laws of war  and the  horror on the rhine  the article explores the demise of the colonial war  category through the employment of french colonial troops  under the 1918 armistice  to occupy the german rhineland  it traces the prevalence of   and the anxieties underpinning   antebellum doctrine on using barbarous forces  in european  war  it then records the silence of postbellum scholars on the horror on the rhine    orchestrated allegations of rape framed in racialized terms of humanity and the requirements of the law of civilized warfare  among possible explanations for this silence  the article follows recent literature that considers this scandal as the embodiment of crises in masculinity  white domination  and european civilization  these crises  like the scandal itself  expressed antebellum jurisprudential anxieties about the capacity   and implications   of black soldiers being drilled white   they also deprived postbellum lawyers of the vocabulary necessary to address what they signified  breakdown of the laws of war  evident  self inflicted european barbarity  and the collapse of international law itself  embodied by the versailles diktat treating germany   as smuts warned  as we would not treat a kaffir nation    as a colonial object   as schmitt lamented  last  the article traces the resurgence of colonial war   it reveals how  at the moment of collapse  in the very instrument embodying it  the category found a new life  article 22 5  of the league of nations covenant  the covenant  reasserted control over the colonial object  furnishing international lawyers with a new vocabulary to address the employment of colonial troops   yet  now  as part of the law of peace   reclassified  both rule and category re emerged  were codified  and institutionalized imperial governance  
 the place of investment awards and wto decisions in international law  a citation analysis international economic law is increasingly applied and in the process developed by international judicial bodies  as cases from international economic fora are multiplying  the place of their growing jurisprudence in general international law is understudied  to some extent  citation analysis allows for an investigation of the influence of other international judicial bodies over these economic fora and the authority the latter exhibited in return  drawing from an original data set of  external citations  to and from the main international fora  more than 3000  external citations  in a larger data set of 75 000 citations   this article examines the citations from and to investment awards and world trade organization decisions  it reveals that these fora differ strikingly in their own citation practice  both in terms of the number of external citations but also in terms of the topics prompting the citations  in addition  the analysis shows that these fora are still rarely cited by other international courts and tribunals  pointing to a limited  at least  explicit  influence in contemporary international dispute settlement  
 the political cultures of irrigation and the proxy battles of interstate water litigation groundwater depletion ignores the political boundaries of western states  the legal boundaries of western water codes  and the jurisdictional boundaries of western water federalism  in the wake of the groundwater revolution  it is becoming apparent that certain interstate lawsuits derive essentially from deeper conflicts rooted in the clash between surface water and groundwater irrigation communities and their respective political cultures  the interstate divide may be yielding to the hydrological divide  this article attends to that deeper relationship between irrigation agriculture and political culture across the great plains  part i provides a brief history of its surface water irrigation communities  to compose a recognizable image of their political culture  one that is rooted in classical western water law and cooperative water federalism  and depends upon interstate compacts and federal irrigation projects  part ii surveys the groundwater revolution and the distinct political culture it has generated  one that doubts the merits of classical western water law  and suspects the power of western water federalism  part iii describes a revealing theater of the conflict between these political cultures  the republican river basin  on the surface  the conflict is a legal casus belli between sovereign states  but beneath that conflict lies a deeper and more intractable conflict  where interstate litigation becomes recognizable as a proxy battle between surface water and groundwater irrigation communities  how the states and the united states resolve this deeper conflict may determine the future of water federalism across the great plains and the fate of the rivers upon which its communities depend  
 the politics of citations at the ecjpolicy preferences of eu member state governments and the citation behavior of judges at the european court of justice this article investigates the relationship between the political preferences of e u  member states and the behavior of judges at the european court of justice  ecj  by analyzing their citation behavior  it shows that judges at the ecj are more likely to cite judgments authored by judges appointed by member state governments with similar preferences regarding european integration  analogous with the context of u s  courts  nonrandom opinion assignment potentially threatens the validity of these results  to overcome this problem  i exploit the unique institutional setting at the ecj to develop an improved identification strategy that builds on comparing the citations in two documents produced in the same case  i e   the judgment and the opinion of the advocate general   the findings in this article provide evidence for the hypothesis that the political preferences of member state governments are reflected in the behavior of the members of the ecj  
 the polycentric turn  a case study of kenya s evolving legal regime for irrigation waters formal legal systems comprise a major part  but not the only part  of the  rules of the game  that structure social and social ecological interactions  throughout the twentieth century  centralization and consolidation of legal authority were dominant themes among many  if not all  legal systems  that process may have been successful in some cases  but in others the presumed economies of scale from consolidation and centralization either did not materialize or were offset by other social costs  including the failure to accommodate local knowledge  expertise  and preferences  in what could become a theme of the twenty first century  many countries  including developing countries  have started to experiment with more polycentric legal systems  as the nobel laureate elinor ostrom referred to them  where local users and user groups have a substantial say in designing and administering rules that apply to them  this case study of kenya amounts to a history of trial and error in efforts to develop an effective legal regime to govern use of irrigation water  in a country that has suffered for more than a century from seasonal water scarcity  inefficient water use  and user conflicts over water resources  from colonial efforts to import british riparian law to complete centralization of legal authority early in the post colonial period  pressure on irrigation water resources and water users only increased  beginning in 2003  however  the government of kenya has been engaged in a process that is not one of simple decentralization or devolution of authority  rather  it is a story of increasing polycentricism  with meaningful participation by local  regional  and national actors in law making and administration  the starting point actually occurred in 1997  when local water users  advised by ngos  formed kenya s first water user association  wua  to help avoid and minimize local water use conflicts  it worked so well that the national government took notice  in 2003  kenya s parliament enacted a brand new water act  which not only legally recognized the existing wua  but actively encouraged and facilitated the creation of what the statute referred to as water resources users associations  wruas   this move to polycentricism appears to have reduced problems  including conflicts  relating to periodic water shortages  and recently drafted  but not yet adopted  legislative proposals would have the effect of strengthening kenya s embrace of polycentric legal control over irrigation water management  
 the preventive approach  opcat and the prevention of violence and abuse of persons with mental disabilities by monitoring places of detention adopted in december 2002  the united nations optional protocol to the convention against torture and other cruel  inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment establishes a system of regular visits undertaken by independent international and national bodies to places where people are deprived of their liberty  in order to prevent torture and other cruel  inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment  the article explores how this collaboration between national and international bodies  with independent mandates to carry out such unannounced visits  represents an important effort in the process of protecting persons with mental disabilities who are detained and who are particularly exposed to exploitation and other forms of serious human rights violations  contrary to article 16 of the convention on the rights of persons with disabilities   c  2017 elsevier ltd  all rights reserved  
 the principle of legal certainty as a principle of economic efficiency legal certainty  a feature of the rule of law  constitutes a requirement for the operational necessities of market interactions  but  the compatibility of the principle of legal certainty with ideals such as liberalism and free market economy must not lead to the hastened conclusion that therefore the principle of legal certainty would be compatible and tantamount to the principle of economic efficiency  we intend to analyse the efficiency rationale of an important general principle of eu law the principle of legal certainty  in this paper  we shall assert that not only does the eu legal certainty principle encapsulate an efficiency rationale  but most importantly  it has been interpreted by the ecj as such  the economic perspective of the principle of legal certainty in the european context has  so far  never been adopted  hence  we intend to fill in this gap and propose the representation of the principle of legal certainty as a principle of economic efficiency  after having deciphered the principle of legal certainty from a law and economics perspective  1   we shall delve into the jurisprudence of the ecj so that the judicial reasoning of the court as this reasoning proves the relevance of the proposed representation  2   finally  we conclude in light of the findings of this paper  3   
 the principle of nulla poena sine lege revisited  the retrospective application of criminal law in the eyes of the european court of human rights this article deals with the application by the european court of human rights  ecthr  of the principle nulla poena sine lege  which is enshrined in article 7 of the european convention on human rights  in two cases against cyprus and spain   kafkaris v  republic of cyprus of 12 february 2008 and in s del rio prada v  spain of 21 october 2013  to do so  the article frames the evolution of the court s case law before the two rulings  the article revises the existing strasbourg doctrine on the contents of article 7 1  and analyses how this doctrine has been particularly applied in the two cases where the applicants  two unrepentant murderers  requested an early release from the state authorities  the article compares the facts under scrutiny  the legal reasoning of the ecthr and the final verdict in both cases and tries to shed some light on the shift in strasbourg case law from kafkaris to del rio prada  
 the principle of systemic integration in human rights law international lawyers and courts consider the principle of systemic integration to be a potential answer to difficulties arising from the fragmentation of public international law  this article questions the application of this approach in the context of human rights treaties  it is argued  first  that in many instances  systemic integration raises serious interpretational and jurisdictional concerns and  second  that systemic integration may give rise to a less diverse international law  
 the privacy case for body cameras  the need for a privacy centric approach to body camera policymaking body mounted cameras are being used by law enforcement with increasing frequency throughout the united states  with calls from government leaders and advocacy groups to further increase their integration with routine police practices  as the technology becomes more common in availability and use  however  concerns grow as to how more frequent and more personal video recording affects privacy interests  as well as how policies can both protect privacy and fulfill the promise of increased official oversight  this note advocates for a privacy centric approach to body camera policy making  positing that such a framework will best serve the public s multifaceted privacy interests without compromising the ability of body cameras to monitor law enforcement misconduct  part i surveys the existing technology and commonplace views of privacy and accountability  part ii examines the unique privacy risks imposed by the technology as well as the countervailing potential for privacy enhancement  demonstrating the value of an approach oriented around privacy interests  part iii assesses how the failure to adopt this approach has resulted in storage policies for body camera footage that inhibit the technology s ability to best serve the public and suggests that a privacy centric perspective can lead to better policy making  finally  part iv examines the flaws of prevailing views with respect to policies for accessing footage and discusses how a revised privacy centric perspective could lead to better policies  
 the problem of binary distinction in cloud computing and the necessity for a different approach  positions of the european union and canada the development of cloud computing is an undisputable fact that is present in this modem era  it is a widely used system  which consists of users from ordinary individuals to multinational companies  however  despite its benefits  there is a problem of accountability in cloud computing  accountability is vital for the allocation of responsibility to ensure the non existence of threats concerning privacy and security of personal data stored in a cloud  both these issues are interconnected because one will not be able to exercise the principle of accountability by omitting the allocation of responsibility  due to the complexity of the cloud computing infrastructure  the line in the distinguishing the role of controller and processor is blurred  this article serves to provide a better understanding of the role of cloud computing as well as to configure the need for either a modified or a completely different approach  furthermore  this article will discuss the different approaches whilst providing a detailed analysis of the roles of the controller and processor  clear and unambiguous roles and responsibilities will help to reinforce the principle of accountability  this article will compare the positions of canada and the european union  because the canadian approach provides a different outlook since they do not follow the same binary distinction concept in allocating responsibility for controller and processor  this discussion hopes to bring awareness for the discrepancies in the current system and attempts to recommend a possible outcome to curb the problems relevant to this issue   c  2017 pardis moslemzadeh tehrani  johan shamsuddin bin hj sabaruddin  dhiviya ap ramanathan  published by elsevier ltd  all rights reserved  
 the problem of social order  what should we count as law  in these two fine contributions to the relatively small body of empirically grounded theoretical accounts of law  fred schauer and richard mcadams focus on the two key elements of any legal system  the coordination of conduct that individuals have an incentive to engage in if they believe others will also  and the coercive force that is needed to deter conduct when coordination incentives are absent or insufficient  both contributions deepen our understanding of the dynamics of coordination and coercion  but both also focus primarily on the concept of law as a set of rules generated and enforced exclusively by government  in this comment  drawing on recent work with barry weingast  i emphasize the importance of extending the scope of analysis to include settings in which governments are missing or weak and where legal order has not yet been achieved or stabilizedthe challenge that faces many poor and developing countries around the world and the challenge that today s advanced legal regimes overcame historically  in our account  coordination and coercion are not substitute mechanisms  but are deeply linked  prior to the establishment of wealthy stable governments  and perhaps even in the presence of such governments   coercive penalties are delivered only if the decentralized application of punishment by ordinary individuals is successfully coordinated and incentivized  
 the problem with hobby lobby  neoliberal jurisprudence and neoconservative values this article explores the relationship between neoconservative values and neoliberalism in american jurisprudence through a critique of the us supreme court s hobby lobby decision  the article uncovers how the court imposes market oriented logic on religious expression and in the process spiritualizes economic activity  in this way neoliberal rationality is intertwined with neoconservative values  for example  exercising religion through corporatization can be understood as a neoconservative moderation of the corrupting influence of excessive neoliberal individualism  finally  while the decision furthers employer control of workers  reproduction  the court s proposed workaround a direct government contraceptives program would undermine that control and points to another  more emancipatory response to the problems of neoliberalism  
 the process is the punishment  juror demographics and case administration in state courts between 1976 and 1999  twelve states passed laws requiring that lists of eligible jurors for state trials be created by selecting at random from publicly available sources  limiting the discretion of jury commissioners to exclude african americans from jury service  a difference in difference analysis suggests these reforms led to a 5 6 percentage point drop in the share of new admissions to prison accounted for by african americans and other minorities  and lower rates of exercise of the death penalty overall  
 the promise and limits of private standards in reducing greenhouse gas emissions from shipping this article examines private standards that aim to mitigate greenhouse gas  ghg  emissions in shipping  these have emerged against a backdrop of regulatory inertia and the exclusion of international shipping from the paris climate change agreement  they are a product of complex governance arrangements and they have addressed areas of market failure that have held back fuel efficiency advances that are made possible by technological innovations  these private standards hold considerable promise but suffer to different degrees from certain weaknesses  notably a lack of transparency  a low level of ambition and concerns about data reliability  this article examines these deficiencies together with the reasons for them  and assesses the role that law could play in addressing them  it argues that the conditions may be present for the mitigation of shipping s ghg emissions to become a site of  hybrid  governance  combining private standards and state supra state law in a productive way  
 the provision of healthcare to young and dependent children  the principles  concepts  and utility of the children act 1989 this article undertakes a thorough analysis of the case law concerned with the provision of healthcare to young and dependent children  it demonstrates how  despite the procedural changes introduced by the children act 1989 at an early stage in this body of case law  cases have continued to be brought to court by way of applications for the court to exercise its inherent jurisdiction or in wardship rather than using the orders introduced by the act  in determining these cases  the court is focused upon its protective duty to the vulnerable but proceedings appear to be adversarial contests between the claims of adults to know what is best for the child in which the medical view normally prevails  through consideration of the principles and concepts of the children act of parental responsibility  working together  the welfare principle and placing the child at the centre of care  this article demonstrates their utility  as yet to be fully realised  in relation to the responsibilities of parents  professionals  public authorities  and the courts concerned with the provision of healthcare to young and dependent children  
 the psychological science of racial bias and policing what can the social psychology of racial bias teach us about the potential for racial bias in policing  because social psychological research is mostly laboratory based and rarely includes police officers  direct generalizability is limited  however  social psychology has identified robust risk factors that make individuals more likely to engage in disparate treatment even without overt prejudice  this article maps these situational risk factors to common experiences in modern patrol policing  specifically  we identify the following situations common to patrol policing as risk factors that make bias more likely to result in discrimination  discretion  novice status  crime focus  cognitive demand  and identity threats  where possible  we also review studies that include officers  and take place in policing relevant contexts  with the map provided in this article  we exhort psychologists to translate previous laboratory findings to field settings to advance the practice of democratic policing and expand the science of bias  
 the puzzle of transitional justice in ukraine after the maidan uprising and the fall of president viktor yanukovych  the ukrainian parliament passed a number of transitional justice measures  including criminal trials and vetting of public employees  members of the law enforcement agencies and the judiciary  despite strong public demand for retribution  only a limited number of suspects have so far been punished under the new laws  this article examines whether the way transitional justice in post maidan ukraine has been carried out corroborates the assumption that can be derived from the transitional justice literature about the scope of retribution after negotiated transitions  it argues that transitional justice in ukraine is generally better explained by  the politics of the present  than by the  politics of the past   but that additional and so far underresearched factors shaping transitional justice outcomes should be included  administrative capacities and traditions and the nexus between a transitional government s international commitments and the role of the judiciary  especially with regard to large scale vetting policies  
 the refinement of international law  from fragmentation to regime interaction and politicization the new posture of international courts and tribunals is the  spirit of systemic harmonization   to use the words of the european court of human rights grand chamber in al dulimi  fifteen years after the  proliferation  speech given by former president of the international court of justice  gilbert guillaume  before the un general assembly and ten years after publication of the international law commission s  fragmentation  report  it is time to bury the f word  along that line  this article concentrates on the positive contribution of the new techniques which courts  tribunals  and other actors have developed in order to coordinate the various subfields of international law  if these are accompanied by a proper politicization of international law and governance  they are apt to strengthen both the effectiveness and the legitimacy of international law  ironically  the ongoing  harmonization  and  integration  within international law could also be conceptualized as a form of procedural constitutionalization  
 the renminbi and systemic risk the internationalization of china s currency  the renminbi  rmb   is arising in ways that depart considerably from historical precedent and what  law and macroeconomic  theory would predict  instead of waiting for international markets for its currency to evolve organically  the chinese government has undertaken a quasi mercantilist strategy designed to promote the currency and its own national rmb based infrastructure  this strategy has emphasized tightly managed capital account deregulation over prudential reforms and robust market supervision  and incentivizes foreign jurisdictions to compete for rmb based transactions  china s monetary strategy introduces novel systemic risks to the global financial system  including a potentially inadequate provision of renminbi liquidity  a regulatory race to the bottom between offshore rmb hubs  and significant transmission belts of financial risk to even non renminbi markets  to mitigate these risks  this article outlines a policy recipe of stronger macroprudential oversight  transparent countercyclical capital account reforms and credible commitments to refrain from competitive currency devaluations  
 the return of the lawyer statesman  ben w  heineman  jr   a fornier general counsel of general electric  has written a book  the inside counsel revolution  proposing an ambitious role for legal advisors to corporations  which he calls  resolving the partner guardian tension   corporate lawyers  heineman argues  must be effective agents in helping their clients attain their performance goals  but they must also ensure that the company acts with  integrity   meaning compliance with the spirit as well as the letter of the laws of the jurisdictions in which the company does business  fostering constructive relations with stakeholders as well as maximizing share prices  and forming collaborations with other companies to promote public policies that mitigate the harmful externalities of corporate conduct  this essay points out that this program looks like a revival of the  managerialist  agenda of progressive corporate statesmen of the 1920s and 1930s and of relatively progressive business associations of the 1950s and 1960s  like the committee for economic development  in recent decades  the managerialist ideal of corporate statesmanship has been abandoned in favor of the view that the only social responsibility of businesses is to maximize their profits and that the only responsibility of their lawyers is to help them overcome regulatory and tax restraints that stand in their way  this essay argues that this dominant vision of corporations as amoral profit seekers and of their lawyers as their amoral facilitators has proved dangerously misguided  and it welcomes the revival of the lawyer statesman ideals of heineman and his collaborators as a corrective  it also raises some questions about the feasibility of the ideal  
 the revolutionary doctrines of european law and the legal philosophy of robert lecourt the creation of today s european legal order is usually traced back to a set of remarkable decisions made by the european court of justice in 1963 and 1964  where  however  did the content of those judgments come from  after all  the doctrines advanced by the court in its van gend en loos  costa v  enel and dairy products decisions were not set out in the treaty of rome itself  this article uses writings by french judge robert lecourt to show how the legal philosophy which lecourt had developed before his appointment to the court  in his scholarship on french property law  can be directly related to the fundamental doctrines that the court created after his appointment  indicating that one of the major objectives of the dominant faction on the court in 1963 and 1964 was a comprehensive rejection of any form of reciprocal or retaliatory self help between the european states  
 the revolving door in international investment arbitration it is often claimed that international investment arbitration is marked by a revolving door  individuals act sequentially and even simultaneously as arbitrator  legal counsel  expert witness  or tribunal secretary  if this claim is correct  it has implications for our understanding of which individuals possess power and influence within this community  and ethical debates over conflicts of interests and transparency concerning  double hatting  when individuals simultaneously perform different roles across cases  in this article  we offer the first comprehensive empirical analysis of the individuals that make up the entire investment arbitration community  drawing on our database of 1039 investment arbitration cases  including icsid annulments  and the relationships between the 3910 known individuals that form this community  we offer the first use of social network analysis to describe the full investment arbitration community and address key sociological and normative questions in the literature  our results partly contradict recent empirical scholarship as we identify a different configuration of central  power brokers   moreover  the normative concerns with double hatting are partly substantiated  a select but significant group of individuals score highly and continually on our double hatting index  
 the rhetoric of abolition  continuity and change in the struggle against america s death penalty  1900 2010 this article seeks to understand when  how  and where the framing of arguments against capital punishment has changed  while others have focused exclusively on the national level  we studied the framing of abolitionist arguments in three american states  connecticut  kansas  and texas  each is located in a different region of the country  and each has its own distinctive death penalty history  we studied the framing of arguments against the death penalty from 1900 to 2010  our study suggests that the rhetorical reframing of the campaign against capital punishment that has occurred at the national level has had deep resonance at the state level  over the course of the 20th century in connecticut  kansas  and texas  the focus on error and arbitrariness has assumed greater prominence among abolitionists  in each state  this change began to take hold in the late 1960s and 1970s and accelerated as the 20th century drew to its close  but  in each state  older frames persisted  older arguments continued to occur with greater frequency than the new abolitionism  
 the right of access to environmental information and legal transplant theory  lessons from london and beijing this article analyzes the potential for legal transplant theory to strengthen the legal regimes that guarantee the right of access to environmental information in england and china  guaranteed by the aarhus convention on access to information  public participation in decision making and access to justice in environmental matters  the right has a substantial impact on how individuals can act as environmental stewards  however  despite the framework provided by the aarhus convention  there are shortcomings in how these states guarantee the right when compared with the obligations set by the provisions of the convention  the article applies alan watson s legal transplant theory to the environmental information regimes in england and china and considers the likelihood of each jurisdiction sourcing legal reforms from the other  it also seeks to identify common trends shared by each jurisdiction and the impact of the aarhus convention on such transplants  
 the right to dignity in the united states under the law   dignity  is a principle that is often invoked  but ill defined  the most recent and prominent example of this was the u s  supreme court s decision in obergefell v  hodges  there  the court created a right to  dignity   but failed to articulate what a right to dignity meant  or how far it reached   this note attempts to provide a definition to the right created by the supreme court  to that end  this note traces federal jurisprudence in order to determine what types of rights are considered to make up one s  dignity   this note then examines the states  use of  dignity  within their respective constitutions to determine whether further insight into dignity s meaning can be found there  
 the right to vote under local law a complete analysis of the right to vote requires at least three levels of inquiry  the u s  constitution and federal law  state constitutions and state law  and local laws that confer voting rights for municipal elections  but most voting rights scholarship focuses on only federal or state law and omits any discussion of the third category  this article the first to explore in depth the local right to vote completes the trilogy  cities and towns across the country are expanding the right to vote in municipal elections to include sixteen  and seventeen year olds  noncitizens  nonresident property owners  and others  berkeley  california  for example  recently lowered the voting age to sixteen for its school board elections  this article highlights these developments  encourages local voter expansions  and provides a test for courts to use when facing a judicial challenge to these rules  if states are  laboratories of democracy  that may experiment with social policies  then municipalities are  test tubes of democracy  that also can try out novel democratic rules  such as broadening the right to vote  on a smaller scale  historically  some voter expansions  such as the elimination of property requirements and the women s suffrage movement  enjoyed early successes at the local level  local voting rights  then  can serve as catalysts for broader reforms as they  trickle across  to other municipalities and  trickle up  to states and congress  as a matter of policy  local jurisdictions should enfranchise anyone who has a sufficient stake in local affairs and has the proper incentives and ability to make informed choices about who should lead them which might include sixteen  and seventeen year olds  noncitizens  who are lawful permanent residents   nonresident property owners  felons  or others  states with barriers to local voting laws  through substantive voter qualifications or lack of  home rule  authorization to localities  should amend their state constitutional provisions or statutes   an appendix presents a fifty state chart on the possibility in each state of enacting local voting laws   courts should defer to local laws that expand the right to vote as a means of local democracy  but should not defer to restrictions on the right to vote because limiting who may vote harms the ideal of democratic inclusion  robust protection of the right to vote depends on local voting rules as an early component of the reform effort  enhanced local voting rights will produce a more representative local government  create a habit of voting for various groups such as younger voters that will ameliorate low turnout  and strengthen local democracy  
 the rise of digital justice  courtroom technology  public participation and access to justice this article addresses a little discussed yet fundamentally important aspect of legal technological transformation  the rise of digital justice in the courtroom  against the backdrop of the government s current programme of digital court modernisation in england and wales  it examines the implications of advances in courtroom technology for fair and equitable public participation  and access to justice  the article contends that legal reforms have omitted any detailed consideration of the type and quality of citizen participation in newly digitised court processes which have fundamental implications for the legitimacy and substantive outcomes of court based processes  and for enhancing democratic procedure through improved access to justice  it is argued that although digital court tools and systems offer great promise for enhancing efficiency  participation and accessibility  they simultaneously have the potential to amplify the scope for injustice  and to attenuate central principles of the legal system  including somewhat paradoxically  access to justice  
 the sec s shift to administrative proceedings  an empirical assessment congress has repeatedly expanded the authority of the sec to pursue violations of securities laws in proceedings adjudicated by the sec s own administrative law judges  most recently through the dodd frank act  we report the results from an empirical study of sec enforcement actions against non financial public companies to assess the impact of the dodd frank act on the balance between civil court and administrative enforcement actions  we show a general decline in the number of court actions and an increase in the number of administrative proceedings post dodd frank  at the same time  we show an increase in average civil penalties post dodd frank for both court actions and administrative proceedings involving non financial public companies  companies were also more willing to cooperate with the sec  consistent with an increase in the sec s leverage in administrative proceedings  we also provide evidence that the mix of cases the sec brings in administrative proceedings has changed post dodd frank  we show an increase in the disgorgement amount and the number of years during which the violation allegedly took place  which are two proxies for the complexity and cost of prosecution of the alleged underlying securities law violation  at the same time  administrative proceedings following dodd frank tended to be weaker  i e   less likely to prevail  and less salient  i e   less likely to garner media attention   these findings are consistent with the sec attempting to maximize the monetary penalties it imposes as well as positive media attention from its enforcement actions  while allocating its limited resources between administrative proceedings and civil court actions in a cost effective way  although we cannot measure the deterrent impact of the additional cases that the shift to administrative proceedings has allowed the sec to bring  it does appear that the sec is using administrative proceedings to expand its enforcement efforts against public companies  
 the second amendment and private law the second amendment  like other federal constitutional rights  is a restriction on government power  but what role does the second amendment have to play if any when a private party seeks to limit the exercise of second amendment rights by invoking private law causes of action  private law specifically  the law of torts  contracts  and property has often been impacted by constitutional considerations  though in seemingly inconsistent ways  the first amendment places limitations on defamation actions and other related torts  and also prevents courts from entering injunctions that could be classified as prior restraints  on the other hand  the first amendment plays almost no role in contractual litigation  even when courts are called on to enforce contractual provisions that directly restrict speech  the equal protection clause was famously interpreted to bar the enforcement of a racially restrictive covenant in shelley v  kraemer  but in the years since  courts have largely limited that case to its facts  this article reconciles these disparate outcomes to develop a coherent theory of the role constitutional rights play in private law  the article argues that three guideposts inform whether constitutional rights are applied to limit private law   1  whether the private law cause of action threatens the core of a constitutional right   2  whether placing a constitutional limitation on private law would impair other constitutional rights  and  3  whether the private law imposition on constitutional rights was freely bargained for  the article then applies this framework to the individual second amendment right recognized in district of columbia v  heller by examining several areas where the right to keep and bear arms could intersect with private law  including negligent entrustment  products liability  and trespass  
 the sequential intercept model and juvenile justice  review and prospectus behavioral health needs in justice involved adolescents are an increasing concern  as it has been estimated that two thirds of youths in the juvenile justice system now meet the criteria for one or more psychological disorders  this article describes the application of the sequential intercept model  sim   developed to describe five points of interception from standard prosecution into rehabilitation oriented alternatives for adults  munetz   griffin  2006   to juvenile justice  the five sim intercepts are   1  first contact with law enforcement or emergency services   2  initial hearings and detention following arrest   3  jails and courts  including problem solving courts    4  re entry from jails  prisons and forensic hospitals  and  5  community corrections and community support  including probation and parole  modifying the sim for application with justice involved adolescents  this article describes three examples of interventions at different intercepts  intercept 1  the philadelphia police school diversion program   intercept 3  problem solving courts for juveniles   and intercept 5  juvenile probation   relevant research evidence for each example is reviewed  and the further application of this model to juveniles is described  copyright  c  2017 john wiley   sons  ltd  
 the shareholder wealth effects of delaware litigation we collect data on the record of every action in hundreds of derivative cases and merger class actions involving public companies filed in the delaware court of chancery from 2004 to 2011  we use these data to analyze how markets respond to litigation in the most important court for corporate disputes in the united states  the detail in the dataset allows us to explore how case characteristics such as the timing of the filing  the presence of certain procedural motions  litigation intensity  and the judge assigned to the case relate to firm value  unlike previous studies  we document that negative abnormal returns are associated with the filing of derivative cases  and we show that this association is particularly strong for cases that are first filed in delaware and are not related to a previously disclosed government investigation  we also develop some evidence that market participants can anticipate litigation intensity and respond by valuing the firm equity less and that markets associate cases with pension fund plaintiffs with better outcomes than cases without this institutional involvement  finally  we find little evidence of abnormal returns associated with judicial assignment at the time of filing for derivative cases  but we do observe an association between judicial assignment and case filing for merger cases  
 the slipperiness of  global law  what is  global law   what is specifically global and specifically legal about global law  is it even coherent to define law by reference to its  globality   these are just some of the questions taken up by neil walker in his new book  intimations of global law  in this review essay  i engage critically with walker s response to these and other questions  whilst i believe that walker s mapping of different  species  of global law is useful and informative in revealing a  state of the art  of globalising legal trends  his effort to draw these various and not necessarily commensurate species together into a coherent meta theorisation of global law is  i believe  far less convincing  walker s conceptualisation of global law is self defined by reference to its openness  its intimated quality and its  adjectival  categorisation  characteristics that leave the concept of global law somewhat  slippery  and malleable to the point of its non utility in actually helping to guide law s direction  resolve normative disputes or remedy apparent accountability deficits and injustices at the global level  
 the social life of abortion law  on personal and political pedagogy the current contribution seeks to start a conversation around our pedagogical practice in respect of abortion law  centralising the traditional portrayal of abortion law within the medical law curriculum  this essay highlights the privileging of a very particular storyline about abortion  exploring the terrain in evaluating medical law methodologies  this essay highlights the illusion of  balance    objectivity   and  neutrality  that emerges from current pedagogy in light of how abortion law is framed and in particular what is excluded  women s own voices  focusing on a number of  exclusions  and  silences  and noting how closely these mirror dominant discourse in the public sphere  this essay highlights the irony of a curriculum that reflects  rather than challenges  these discursive gaps  arguing that the setting of a curriculum is inevitably political  ambitions for delivering a programme around abortion that is  neutral    objective   or  balanced  are dismissed  instead  highlighting the problems of what is currently excluded  how materials are ordered  and the tacit hierarchies that lend legitimacy and authority to a particular way of  knowing  abortion  this essay argues for a new curriculum and a new storyline one which is supported by prior learning in feminist legal scholarship and a medical law curriculum in which the social  historical  geographical  and above all  personal is ever present and central  
 the south african constitutional court  upholding the rule of law and the separation of powers the supremacy of the constitution and the rule of law are key features of the post apartheid legal order in south africa  for either to have any real value  however  it is necessary that they are interpreted and applied by an independent judiciary that is free from executive influence  this important task has fallen mainly on the constitutional court  it has recently been called upon to rule on the lawfulness of the conduct of both the president and the national assembly and held that both had acted unlawfully and inconsistently with the constitution  in the author s view  this ruling signifies that the maturing court is fully aware of its own constitutional obligations and that  unlike its apartheid era predecessors that were hamstrung by the supremacy of parliament  it possesses a mandate to check the abuse of power by other branches of government  
 the standard theory of administrative unlawfulness according to the standard theory of administrative unlawfulness an act that is public law unlawful is  for that reason  invalid and of no effect in law  in this article i suggest that the theory ought to be rejected  i begin by outlining the standard theory as well as noting its endorsement by the supreme court in the case of ahmed  no  2   having in the main part of the paper criticised the theory  i move to lay out an alternative  that unlawfulness signals not the invalidity of an administrative act but a duty on the part of the court to invalidate it  noting that the alternative rests upon what appears to be a paradox   that unlawful administrative action may nonetheless have legal effect   i try to show why it is more apparent than real  finally  i return to the decision in ahmed  no  2   
 the statement of interest as a tool in federal civil rights enforcement the federal government recently has ramped up its use of statements of interest amicus filings that are filed in federal and state trial courts across the country  filing such briefs has become a key litigation strategy for federal civil rights enforcement  but no one has made a sustained effort to analyze these often  unnoticed statements  this note places a spotlight on the briefs in civil rights litigation  offering the first wide ranging analysis of them  the filing of such briefs  though a marked departure from historical governmental practice  generally is consistent with the government s longstanding role in protecting civil rights and promoting social change  still  the practice is shrouded in mystery  and the department of justice does not appear to follow many  if any  rules or guidelines when issuing the amicus statements  this note offers recommendations for increased transparency and more structured use of the government briefs  
 the supreme court s judgment in miller  in search of constitutional principle in r   miller  v secretary of state for exiting the european union  the supreme court of the uk  1  held that the uk government had no prerogative power to initiate the formal process whereby the uk will withdraw from the eu and  2  declined to recognise any requirement that the devolved legislatures  consent be obtained in respect of legislation authorising the government to commence the withdrawal process  this article critically examines miller  arguing that the majority s analysis veers between unwarranted muscularity in relation to the prerogative issue and unnecessary conservatism as regards the devolution issue  the article goes on to argue that while the majority judgment s restrictive approach to the prerogative may be viewed as a progressive victory for constitutional principle  such an evaluation can be sustained only if a set of relatively traditional constitutional premises are adopted to begin with  the article also contends that the general approach adopted by the majority is problematic  given its willingness to invoke arguments of constitutional principle without adequately engaging with questions about what the pertinent principles are  and argues that such an intellectually lackadaisical mode of constitutional adjudication is to be deprecated  
 the sustainable development goals and redd plus   assessing institutional interactions and the pursuit of synergies this paper analyzes potential synergies between two recent sustainable development initiatives  namely the sustainable development goals  sdgs  and reducing emissions from deforestation and forest degradation  redd    a climate mitigation mechanism negotiated under the auspices of the united nations framework convention on climate change  the paper elaborates a conceptual framework based on institutional interactions and distinguishes core  complementary  and supplementary synergies that may be realized between the sdgs and redd   potential synergies are analyzed at the global level  as well as within two national level contexts  indonesia  with its long standing redd  programme  and myanmar  which is in the early stages of implementing redd   both are now also engaging nationally with the sdg implementation process  our research draws on literature review and document analysis  direct observations of global policy processes relating to redd  and sdgs  as well as extensive engagement  of one author  at national level in indonesia and myanmar  our analysis reveals that there are currently significant opportunities to pursue synergies in the implementation of these international initiatives at the national level  although pro active interaction management is necessary  especially to achieve complementary synergies  
 the ties between the world trade organization and preferential trade agreements  a textual analysis although many believe preferential trade agreements  ptas  are incompatible with the world trade organization  wto   we lack empirical evidence on this topic  in this article  we examine international trade agreements the source of trade law and employ two types of text analysis to determine the presence of the wto in ptas  our systematic comparisons of post uruguay round ptas and relevant wto agreements reveal a strong  two part presence of the wto in ptas  nearly all recent ptas reference the wto explicitly  often dozens of times across multiple chapters  likewise  in many of these same ptas we find that substantial portions of treaty language sometime the majority of a chapter is copied verbatim from a wto agreement  moreover  multiple regression analyses reveal that larger countries and those most active in preferential agreement making are actually most likely to include a strong wto presence in their ptas  additionally  the presence of the wto in ptas has increased over time  our study contributes novel and robust empirical evidence to suggest that the ties between the wto and ptas are more solid than is realized  
 the trade regime as a complex adaptive system  exploration and exploitation of environmental norms in trade agreements while the trade regime is often analyzed under the metaphoric assumptions of newtonian mechanics  we propose an alternative  more organic representation  we argue that the trade regime seems to evolve as a complex adaptive system  at the edge of order and chaos  drawing from a dataset of 280 different types of environmental provisions found in 680 trade agreements  we show how both the trade regime and the norms contained therein unfold by remaining stable  but not static  and dynamic  but not chaotic   trade negotiators simultaneously explore new grounds by introducing legal innovations and exploiting known territories by adopting existing norms  our analysis suggests that  even as the regime grows in the number and length of agreements  there are exploratory and exploitative processes at work  these twin processes can explain that the trade regime appears neither more fragmented heterogeneous nor more centralized homogenous than it was 50 years ago  despite its substantial expansion  this hypothesis is at the core of the research agenda that this article lays out  
 the trans pacific partnership and regulatory space  a comparison of treaty texts the trans pacific partnership  tpp  agreement  signed in february of 2016  is an ambitious effort to set high standards on a  mega regional  level  this article examines the tpp s investment provisions with a focus on their most controversial dimension  the extent to which they constrain the  state regulatory space   srs  of host states  we embrace the text as data approach by coding the tpp and other investment agreements among tpp parties on design features related to srs  the challenges presented by this coding exercise demonstrate some of the advantages of manual coding over automated methods when nuance and interpretation are required  with our data  we first compare the tpp to other agreements and find that it scores relatively high on srs  although it falls within the range of existing agreements and does not seem to chart new territory in this regard  we then investigate which existing agreements are most similar to and dissimilar from the tpp with respect to srs  using regression analysis  we consider a number of factors to explain this variation and find that the tpp is most similar to agreements involving the usa  to agreements among western hemispheric countries  to other free trade agreements with investment chapters  and to more recent agreements  however  different factors seem to matter if we look only at provisions related to investor state dispute settlement versus substantive provisions  implying that it is important to distinguish between the substantive and procedural dimensions of treaties  
 the transboundary dispute over the waters of the silala siloli  legal vandalism and goffmanian metaphor the waters of the silala siloli  located in the hyper arid atacama desert dividing bolivia and chile  originate in bolivia  flow for a mere four kilometers before entering chile  and flow for four more kilometers before commingling with the san pedro tributary and debouching into the pacific ocean  and yet this tiny basin  located in one of the most remote and inhospitable places on earth  forms what the united nations calls one of the most hydropolitically vulnerable basins in the world  bolivia claims that a chilean concessionaire artificially diverted the waters in 1908 and chile now illegally draws from the waters  long after bolivia terminated the concession agreement  chile claims the waters form a natural transboundary watercourse that would flow as a servitude into chile even if the waters never had been augmented or directed by the canals  questions of law and fact blur the legal status of these waters  their possible relationship to a transboundary aquifer  and the customary application of equitable and reasonable use standards regarding a river  if indeed the silala siloli is a river  as the case heads toward the hague for consideration by the international court of justice  this article concentrates on the evolving relationship between these historically troubled riparian  borrowing from the sociological framework analysis of erving goffman to investigate how international dispute settlement mechanisms may indeed be challenged by ceremonial forms of dramaturgy that play more to domestic audiences than pacific settlement outcomes  in the anthropocene age  acute concerns about fresh water and non navigable watercourses now have the potential to erupt into major conflicts between states  these conflicts draw critical attention to the evolving relationship between groundwater and surface water regimes  certainly in the great hydrographic basins of the world and  as this case details  in one of the smallest and most remote catchments on earth  
 the transnationalization of law  rethinking law through transnational environmental regulation this article argues that the rise of transnational regulation has a transformative impact on law  it examines the field of transnational environmental regulation to show that its proliferation challenges the continued appropriateness of representations of law as  i  territorial   ii  emanating from the state   iii  composed of a public and private sphere   iv  constitutive and regulatory in function  and  v  cohesive and regimented  instead  law is increasingly perceived as  i  delocalized   ii  flowing from a plurality of sources   iii  organizationally inchoate   iv  reflexive and coordinating in function  and  v  polycentric  together  these shifts in perception amount to a transformation that the article identifies as the transnationalization of law  the article then explores three responses to the transnationalization of law  it distinguishes responses motivated by a desire to reclaim the traditional conception of law from those that seek to reconstruct law at the transnational level and responses that advocate a context responsive reconceptualization of law  each response  it will be shown  creates a different set of opportunities for  and challenges to  the relevance of law for transnational regulation  
 the treatment of chinese soes in china s wto protocol of accession the two central issues in china s accession to the world trade organization  wto  were its economic size and the large role the state had played in economic decisions   the treatment of state owned enterprises  soes  as central to addressing the latter point  while the protocol of accession imposed obligations on china that went beyond what was required of other wto members  it has not been effective at resolving concerns about chinese soes  this demonstrates  in part  the limitations in using the wto as a vehicle to promote economic reform  
 the truth about loyalty  emotions  ex combatants and transitioning from the past despite a rich body of literature on ex combatants in transitional contexts  the reasons why former armed actors may be reluctant to engage with formal mechanisms of truth recovery have been less well explored  this article argues that ex combatants  antipathy towards truth recovery cannot be properly understood without critically interrogating the emotions vested in the combatant  ex combatant experience and the intersection between emotions  politics and ideology  in particular  the article focuses on the emotion of loyalty and its influence on pro state armed actors  it uses the case of loyalist ex combatants in northern ireland as a prism through which to explore this tension  four overlapping notions of loyalty are identified   loyalty as betrayal    loyalty  blame and managing shame    loyalty as silence  and  loyalty as protection   the article concludes by suggesting the need for greater recognition of the role of loyalty in mediating relationships with  and willingness to investigate  the past  
 the un convention on the rights of persons with disabilities   rights  will and preferences  in relation to mental health disabilities the un convention on the rights of persons with disabilities spells out in the most up to date and specific manner the rights of persons with disabilities  in doing so the convention presents serious challenges to many conventional practices in respect of people with disabilities  especially those with mental health disabilities  according to a number of authorities  most notably the un committee on the rights of persons with disabilities   substitute decision making  is not consistent with the convention   respect for the rights  will and preferences  is to be regarded as the touchstone for compliance with the convention  however  will and preferences  is nowhere defined  this paper examines the meaning of these terms  and draws attention to instances where a contemporaneous  preference  may be at variance with a person s in such cases  it is argued  that  substitute decision making    or giving effect to the person s  will    may be justified  crown copyright  c  2017 published by elsevier ltd  all rights reserved  
 the unbearable rightness of auer for more than seventy years  courts have deferred to reasonable agency interpretations of ambiguous regulations  the auer principle  as it is now called  has attracted academic criticism and some skepticism within the supreme court  but the principle is entirely correct  in the absence of a clear congressional direction  courts should assume that because of their specialized competence  and their greater accountability  agencies are in the best position to decide on the meaning of ambiguous terms  the recent challenges to the auer principle rest on fragile foundations  including an anachronistic understanding of the nature of interpretation  an overheated argument about the separation of powers  and an empirically unfounded and logically weak argument about agency incentives  which exemplifies what we call  the sign fallacy   
 the unexpected role of tax salience in state competition for businesses can bring is a well known phenomenon  however  in recent years  a handful of states have added a mysterious new tool to their kit of incentives used in this competition  unlike more traditional incentives  these new incentives which this article brands  customer based incentives  offer tax relief to a firm s customers rather than directly to the firm  the puzzle underlying customer based incentives is that tax relief provided to the firm s customers would seem more difficult for the firm to capture than relief provided directly to the firm strange  as a state s primary goal is to subsidize the firm s investment in the state  after examining the emergence of this new form of incentive  this article offers a novel explanation for its use and potential for success  specifically  the article argues that the effects of predictable consumer biases  particularly with respect to the salience of the tax relief provided by the incentives to consumers  cause customer based incentives to differ substantively from traditional incentives in ways that are beneficial to both firms and states  customer based incentives thus present an example of how taxpayer behavior can influence the substantive effects of tax provisions  even causing two provisions with the same goal to differ on the ground  taking these behavioral effects into account provides opportunities to increase the effectiveness of tax provisions  
 the untenable case for perpetual dual class stock the desirability of a dual class structure  which enables founders of public companies to retain a lock on control while holding a minority of the company s equity capital  has long been the subject of a heated debate  this debate has focused on whether dual class stock is an efficient capital structure that should be permitted at the time of initial public offering   ipo    by contrast  we focus on how the passage of time since the ipo can be expected to affect the efficiency of such a structure  our analysis demonstrates that the potential advantages of dual class structures  such as those resulting from founders  superior leadership skills  tend to recede  and the potential costs tend to rise  as time passes from the ipo  furthermore  we show that controllers have perverse incentives to retain dual class structures even when those structures become inefficient over time  accordingly  even those who believe that dual class structures are in many cases efficient at the time of the ipo should recognize the substantial risk that their efficiency may decline and disappear over time  going forward  the debate should focus on the permissibility of finite term dual class structures that is  structures that sunset after a fixed period of time  such as ten or fifteen years  unless their extension is approved by shareholders unaffiliated with the controller  we provide a framework for designing dual class sunsets and address potential objections to their use  we also discuss the significant implications of our analysis for public officials  institutional investors  and researchers  
 the updated icrc commentary on the second geneva convention  demystifying the law of armed conflict at sea since their publication in the 1950s and 1980s respectively  the commentaries on the geneva conventions of 1949 and their additional protocols of 1977 have become a major reference for the application and interpretation of those treaties  the international committee of the red cross  together with a team of renowned experts  is currently updating these commentaries in order to document developments and provide up to date interpretations of the treaty texts  following a brief overview of the methodology and process of the update as well as a historical background to the second geneva convention  this article addresses the scope of applicability of the convention  the type of vessels it protects  in particular hospital ships and coastal rescue craft   and its relationship with other sources of international humanitarian law and international law conferring protection to persons in distress at sea  it also outlines differences and commonalities between the first and the second conventions  including how these have been reflected in the updated commentary on the second convention  finally  the article highlights certain substantive obligations under the convention and how the updated commentary addresses some of the interpretive questions they raise  
 the us reorganization regime in the chinese mirror  legal transplantation and obstructed efficiency in the past decade national lawmaking for regulating commerce has been driven by globalization and the transplantation of foreign laws  the new chinese enterprise bankruptcy law enacted in 2006 was modeled closely on the u s  bankruptcy code  especially chapter 11  which puts the bargaining game at the center of corporate reorganization  legal scholarship has not yet comprehensively explored how business law transplants from a market economy like that of the united states to a socialistic market economy like that of china  this article provides an in depth comparison of the reorganization bargaining regimes of bankruptcy law in the united states and china  focusing on the socio legal context in which these regimes operate  the comparison shows how the bargaining game at the core of chapter 11 suffers from obstructed efficiency when transplanted to a chinese context  art obstruction caused by historical  political  economic  and social factors  
 the use of  macro  legal analysis in the understanding and development of global environmental governance this article examines the manner in which macro  legal analysis can potentially assist in overcoming some of the issues that are faced in the understanding and development of global environmental governance  geg   it argues that the analysis of law through separate and distinct disciplines   such as environmental law  trade law  corporate law  and human rights law   results in what this article refers to as micro  legal analysis  as such  it contends that this can have the effect of creating obstacles in the development of coherent and effective legal and policy choices related to the protection of the environment  it illustrates these arguments with examples of practical problems that have arisen from the separation of legal issues in practice and provides the theoretical underpinnings  based on the critique of international lawyers  for the application of macro  legal analysis  in other words  it argues for a form of analysis that would consider the entire range of relevant legal disciplines in a unitary process  it then provides a methodology for the development and application of macro  legal analysis in relation to environmental issues  finally  it considers the potential that this approach could have within the field of geg and comments on the implications that it could have for the way in which lawyers are trained in the future  
 the use of big data  a russian perspective of personal data security this article examines the impact of big data technology on russian citizens  constitutional rights to a private life  there are several laws in the russian federation covering data privacy and protection  but these are proving inadequate to protect the citizens  rights in the face of the ever increasing use of massive data sets and their analysis by big data tools  one particular problem in this regard is that datasets of anonymised records currently not covered under personal data laws  because they do not identify individuals  can  in fact  be used to identify data subjects  the individuals to whom the data refers  when combined and analysed using big data tools  furthermore  existing sanctions for misuse of personal data are minor  and often fail to act as a deterrent when the commercial benefits of exploiting user data  e g  through targeted advertising  are so much greater  from the point of view of companies handling big data  a general confusion over definitions and responsibilities is making compliance with the law difficult  leaving most to come up with their own forms of best practice  rather than being able to follow clear industry recommendations  the article examines existing laws and oversight bodies  discusses how the current provisions are inadequate to deal with new developments in big data  and proposes recommendations for amending and updating existing laws and policies   c  2017 anna konstantinovna zharova  vladimir mikhailovich elin  published by elsevier ltd  all rights reserved  
 the use of noncourt based corporate rescue  does the australian voluntary administration procedure provide a model for china  in the recent international history of insolvency law reform  the reform of corporate rescue and restructuring has been an ongoing project  in china  the enactment of the enterprise bankruptcy law 2006 saw the introduction of a bankruptcy reorganisation procedure that incorporates the debtor in possession model found in chapter 11 of the us bankruptcy code  however  the chinese corporate rescue procedure has been significantly underused due in part to various drawbacks associated with this court based and highly politicalised process  this paper explores the possibility of reforming china s current corporate rescue regime by drawing upon the australian voluntary administration procedure  found in part 5 3a of the corporations act 2001  cth   this procedure was designed to provide a relatively swift  inexpensive and flexible corporate rescue mechanism for companies in financial distress  it comprises a noncourt based mechanism under the control of one or more professionally qualified private administrators  it is interesting to note that the uk also moved away from exclusive reliance upon court based administration procedures following the passage of the enterprise act 2002  this moved the uk closer to the australian practitioner dominated approach to corporate rescue  this paper argues that the addition of a voluntary administration style procedure to china s current corporate rescue regime may be needed as china develops its market economy based on the rule of law  copyright  c  2017 insol international and john wiley   sons  ltd  
 the value of accuracy in the patent system because it must rely on imperfect information  the patent system will inevitably make mistakes  to determine how the system ought to err in cases of uncertainty and whether a given mistake is worth correcting scholars have composed a simple picture of the consequences of error in either direction  on the one hand  erroneous patent awards impose unjustified costs  on the other hand  erroneous patent denials discourage successful inventors and reduce incentives to create in the future  the result is an essentially indeterminate balancing  in which policies of overly liberal awards drive up costs  and policies of overly cautious awards drive down incentives  as this article will show  this conventional approach to error costs understates the role that accuracy plays in producing the benefits of the patent system  critically  the incentives to invent created by the patent system depend on the difference between an inventor s expected returns if she invents and her expected returns if she does not invent  erroneous patent awards do not simply increase the costs of the patent system but also narrow the expected difference between inventing and not inventing  undeserved patent rights thus undermine the very incentives the system is intended to create  this article presents a framework for evaluating the value of accuracy in the patent system  as it turns out  the consequences of an undeserved patent depend significantly on a factor that has not been previously given much attention  whether the unsatisfied patentability requirement is one that seeks to influence a mutually exclusive choice  some patentability doctrines satisfy this condition  but others do not  the result is that erroneous patent awards may in some ways be more harmful and in other ways less harmful than previously thought  
 the value of the european court of human rights to the united kingdom national debates concerning the appropriate role of the european court of human rights  ecthr  in the united kingdom  uk  recently intensified with the suggestion by the government that the uk might leave the european convention on human rights system  it has been argued that a british bill of rights  to replace the current system of national human rights protection provided by the human rights act 1998  would provide better protection than the ecthr  making its role in the national system redundant  claiming that the ecthr is legitimate and has an impact that is usually illustrated by the transformative power of judgments more than 10 years  old  have not provided a convincing answer to this claim  in this article  rather than legitimacy or impact  the value of the ecthr to the objective of protecting human rights through law is assessed  three different levels of value are identified from the relevant literature and then applied to the judgments of the court concerning the uk from 2011 to 2015 to determine what has happened in practice  it is concluded that given that the uk government s objective remains to protect human rights through law  although some types of value are now more relevant than others  overall the potential value of the court to the uk in achieving this objective is still clearly evident  
 the victim of historical child sexual abuse in the irish courts 1999 2006 in recent years  ireland has been rocked by revelations of historical child sexual abuse  this has led to a variety of state responses but one question remains particularly difficult to answer  why did the sexual abuse of children go unrecognized as a societal problem for so long  this article seeks answers by scrutinizing cases in which defendants sought to have their trial prohibited because of the delayed reporting  it explores the legal test used in the period 1999 2006  which focussed on the abuser s dominion  over the victim  the use of the notion of dominion elicited valuable information about the reasons for the delay and how children were silenced  uncovering these stories is essential to understanding the dynamics of child sexual abuse  however  a critical reading of the delay cases that draws on feminist critiques of battered woman s syndrome and rape trauma syndrome reveals law s power to impose hegemonic discourses onto victims and to produce new histories  under the dominion paradigm  the courts distorted victims  accounts of their experiences and sidelined stories that pointed towards a culture of indifference to abuse  thus  law is shown to occupy a paradoxical position in relation to ireland s history of child sexual abuse  
 the vulnerable adult experiment  situating vulnerability in adult safeguarding law and policy this article explores the intersection of english adult protection law and policy as it impacted on the lives of people with mental disabilities  it evaluates developments that were premised on the notion of the  vulnerable adult   in light of recent theoretical interrogation of vulnerability and the normative shifts in law and policy advocated by the uncrpd  i argue that the policy and legal conceptions of vulnerability developed in england and wales  if reworked  have the potential to transform our understanding of what it is to be vulnerable into a more radical and socially grounded framework for adult safeguarding  this article concludes with some reflections on what further conceptual and policy work must be done in order to effect that transformation  crown copyright  c  2017 published by elsevier ltd  all rights reserved  
 the withdrawal cannot be withdrawn  the irrevocability of a withdrawal notification under article 50 2  teu though the view is widely shared that a member state can unilaterally revoke its notification of withdrawal from the eu under art  50 2  teu  both an analysis of this provision in accordance with classical methods of interpretation  as well as a comparative legal analysis in the light of public international law and domestic private contract laws  seem to indicate otherwise  contrary to widespread allegations  the denial of a  unilateral  right of revocation will also not produce untenable or absurd results  rather  a sound balancing of the interests of the affected parties presupposes that a withdrawal notification can only be revoked if all member states give their consent to this course of action  
 the work of international law this article crystallizes and then critiques a prominent view about the role of international law in the global order  the view what i call the  cooperation thesis  is that international law serves to help global actors cooperate  specifically by   1  curbing their disputes  and  2  promoting their shared goals  the cooperation thesis often appears as a positive account of international law  it purports to explain or describe what international law does  but it also has normative force  international law is widely depicted as dysfunctional when it does not satisfy the thesis  in particular  heated or intractable conflict is thought to betray the limits of international law to show that  on some issues  international law is not serving its functions  that view of international law is conceptually flawed  it incorrectly assumes that conflict is an impediment to international law or a problem for international law to mitigate  as scholars from other disciplines have shown  however  conflict is symbiotic with the very functions that the thesis prizes  even as international law enables global actors to curb their disputes and work toward their shared aims  it also enables them to do the opposite  to hone in on their differences and disagree at times fiercely and without resolution  it does so because the two kinds of interactions are interdependent  and the legal mechanisms for both are the same  to put the point more starkly  conflict does not necessarily reveal deficiencies in international law because enabling it is inherent in the project of international law  
 the workload of the wto appellate body  problems and remedies the wto appellate body has seen its workload grow significantly over the years  reflecting not only the rising number of cases handled by the wto dispute settlement mechanism  buts also an increase in the size of the disputes  the number of issues raised on appeal  the number of participants and third participants  the total length of submissions  as well as an accumulation of jurisprudence  as a result  appellate body proceedings now as a rule exceed  in some cases significantly  the 90 day timeframe prescribed by the dispute settlement understanding  the present article sheds new light on this controversial issue  taking as a starting point the relevant reform proposals made by wto members  bringing into the discussion broader   institutional  policy and comparative   considerations  the article delves into the adequacy and sufficiency of the different alternatives for alleviating the appellate body s workload with a view to identifying the most opportune ways for ensuring the efficient future functioning of the wto dispute settlement system  
 the world court s jurisdictional formalism and its lost market share  the marshall islands decisions and the quest for a suitable dispute settlement forum for multilateral disputes on 5 october 2016  the international court of justice  icj  the court  rendered three judgments declining to take jurisdiction in the marshall islands cases  in which that state alleged that india  pakistan  and the united kingdom violated their nuclear disarmament obligations under the treaty on the non proliferation of nuclear weapons and customary international law  in declining to take jurisdiction  the court further confirmed its recent shift to jurisdictional formalism  initiated in georgia v  russia and confirmed in both belgium v  senegal and the alleged violations  nicaragua v  colombia  judgment  what is more  the court heightened the burden of proving the existence of a dispute by incorporating an objective awareness  requirement in its analysis  the present contribution critically situates the court s judgments within the context of the law of state responsibility and global security  with particular emphasis on the broader implications going forward  it first explores the principal features of the court s formalistic shift on jurisdictional matters in the cases  setting the stage for the subsequent discussion  the article then turns to the broader implications of these decisions for state responsibility  taking into consideration that the disputes  submitted to the court are not strictly bilateral in nature  my ambition is also to highlight the nexus between jurisdictional issues  state responsibility law  and broader questions of access to justice in multilateral disputes  by way of conclusion  the article highlights the importance of identifying creative solutions in a post marshall islands world  suggesting the un general assembly as a law making facilitator and the un security council as an alternate   albeit imperfect   dispute settlement forum to tackle multilateral disputes with global security implications  
 the world heritage convention and tasmania s tall eucalypt forests  can an international treaty on environmental protection transcend the vicissitudes of domestic politics  unesco s world heritage convention provides for the protection of natural and cultural heritage deemed to be of outstanding universal value  the 1031 sites inscribed on world heritage list are a source of prestige for the countries where they occur  however  conflicts between protection of outstanding universal value and resource extraction can arise within large scale natural landscapes  the tall eucalypt forests of the australian island of tasmania have been at the heart of such a conflict for over 30 years  the aim of this paper is to analyse how the processes of the convention respond to contrasting approaches by a state party  the paper traces the history of the dispute over tasmania s tall eucalypt forests through the convention s processes of evaluation  inscription and boundary modification  in particular  it considers the processes and outcomes pertaining to two diametrically opposed proposals for minor modification to the boundaries of the tasmanian wilderness made by consecutive australian governments in 2013 and 2014  the first was for the purpose of protecting the forests  and the second for opening them to logging in order to fulfil a domestic election promise  in each case  criteria weighted in favour of long term heritage protection played a critical role  the application of these criteria  combined with strong domestic concern and the ability of unesco s world heritage committee to prioritize heritage protection  has resulted in the protection of these forests and the enhancement of the ecological resilience of the tasmanian wilderness world heritage area  the paper concludes that the power of an international treaty can transcend the vicissitudes of domestic politics and provide enduring protection of outstanding universal value  particularly when backed by strong domestic scrutiny and community support  
 the wto in an era of preferential trade agreements  thick and thin institutions in global trade governance this article examines how fragmentation of the global trade regime into preferential agreements  built on a multilateral baseline of world trade organization  wto  rules  affects trade governance  the analysis relies on 105 interviews with trade policy professionals in core wto members and a conceptual distinction between thick  and thin  institutionalism to capture institutional changes in the global trade governance architecture  the wto s thick institutionalism facilitates institutionalized interactions among members of the trade policy community that are essential for transparency and dialogue and the rule of law character of the trade regime  it secures the continued belief of trade policy professionals in the wto s centrality in trade governance  the thin institutionalism of the network of preferential agreements spells the return to a la carte forms of trade governance and benefits those with the technical and political capacity to successfully navigate the fragmented governance architecture  ongoing institutional transformations shift global trade governance away from rules based back to more power based forms  
 the yates memo  looking for  individual accountability  in all the wrong places the department of justice has received a great deal of criticism for its failure to prosecute both corporations and individuals involved in corporate fraud  in an effort to quiet some of that criticism  on september 9  2015  then deputy attorney general sally q  yates issued a policy entitled   individual accountability for corporate wrongdoing   or the  yates memo   as it has been called  the main thrust of the yates memo is that in order for a corporation to receive any credit for cooperating with the government and obtain leniency in the form of a deferred prosecution agreement  the corporation must not only conduct an internal investigation and turn over the results  but it must also point the finger at culpable employees  the yates memo puts a particular emphasis on the need to hold high level officials responsible for misconduct  this article argues that the yates memo is a misguided attempt to further put law enforcement responsibilities on the backs of corporations rather than the department of justice  in addition  the yates memo jeopardizes the corporation s ability to conduct effective internal investigations into corporate wrongdoing because it threatens both the corporate attorney client privilege and the relationship between employers and employees  this article maintains that if the department of justice truly wants to find  individual accountability   it must stop relying on corporations and conduct its own investigations  furthermore  if the department of justice wants to obtain criminal convictions of high level executives  there may be a need for new legislation that holds high level executives accountable for the criminal misdeeds of their subordinates  
 the yates memo  watch out  the doj is coming or is it  corporate scandals and misconduct have persisted throughout twenty first century america  since 1999  the department of justice   doj   has attempted to provide federal prosecutors with guidance on how to prosecute corporations through the issuance of a series of memorandums  in september 2015  former deputy attorney general sally quillian yates issued the latest memorandum aimed at targeting individuals involved in corporate crimes  this note will discuss the yates memo and will argue that it serves at least two valuable functions  regardless of whether or not it simply solidifies existing policies  first  the revised requirement that cooperation credit is now  all or nothing  puts more pressure on companies to identify individual wrongdoers right from the outset of the investigation and reduces the opportunities for corporations to withhold crucial information needed by the doj  second  the memo will hopefully serve as an incentive for individuals to abide by rules and regulations  since corporations are obligated under the yates memo to disclose all relevant facts regarding individuals potentially involved in the misconduct in exchange for cooperation credit  it will perceivably be harder for employees to hide behind the corporation as a legal entity  this note will also address the shortcomings of the yates memo  examining problems that are either presented or left unaddressed  finally  this note will explore the effects of the yates memo on recent cases like the volkswagen scandal and its implications for success  in light of recent political developments  
 theory and values in socio legal studies this article argues that socio legal studies  sls  should engage with ultimate values  in max weber s sense  insofar as these influence law and social action linked to law  the article sketches orientations in socio legal research that have deterred concern with such values  it suggests a way to conceptualize values as a component of culture  and illustrates this by reference to aspects of the regulation of religious and ethnic minorities  on the one hand  and business and financial networks  on the other  finally  it considers how sls s commitment to science impacts on the study of values  it argues that empirically grounded socio legal theory can suggest why and how certain ultimate values come to seem meaningful and relevant in particular social conditions  as components of cultural experience  values relate to law in complex ways  and sls can and should give more attention to this relation  
 this name is your name  public landmarks  private trademarks  and our national parks to generations of americans  yosemite national park and its landmarks have symbolized the core democratic ideals of the united states spaces truly owned by the people and open to all  1  for those who created our national parks    t he purpose of preserving this land was to cultivate a kind of rare experience  they  saw as endangered by a social world that turned every thing  moment  and human being to profit   2  it is striking  then  that yosemite  one of the nation s first national parks  has become the focus of a battle over whether our landmarks and their names belong to us all or to a select few  in 2016  several yosemite national park landmarks were renamed due to an ongoing trademark dispute between a concessions company and the national park service  nps   at the end of its contract with the park  the departing concessions company demanded compensation for the trademarks to the words  the ahwahnee    wawona    badger pass    curry village   and perhaps most shockingly   yosemite national park  itself during its contractual relationship with the nps and apparently unbeknownst to nps administrators the concessions company filed for and received trademarks for use of these landmark names in hospitality and merchandising contexts  allowing short term concessionaires to trademark the names of publicly owned and culturally treasured assets implicates key trademark principles in several ways  the oft recited aims of trademark law are providing information to the consumer  promoting competition  and avoiding dilution of brands by protecting accrued goodwill  allowing short term concessionaires to register national park landmark names conflicts with each of these aims  as this note explains  a limited contractual relationship fits poorly with the enduring cultural value of well known landmarks and raises complex questions about business operations and intellectual property in the national park context  this note contends that principles of trademark law and policy are undermined if federal contractors can establish long term proprietary rights over national park landmark names  to provide a comprehensive picture of the yosemite case  part i will further explore the facts surrounding the trademarks and landmarks in question  as well as the contractual relationship between dnc parks   resorts at yosemite  inc   dncy  and the nps  part ii considers the nps s claims for cancellation of the yosemite linked trademarks under existing u s  trademark law  part iii argues that concessionaire registrations are inconsistent with the baseline goals of trademark law  finally  part iv suggests that legislation  similar to a statute recently enacted in california  represents a possible solution to the issues surrounding private trademarking of public landmark names  this note asserts that the purposes of trademark law support taking the names of national parks and landmarks off the bargaining table and out of would be profiteers  reach  and that providing our national park landmark names with statutory protection from commercial interests fits perfectly within the american tradition of preserving the parks themselves  there is nothing so american as our national parks  the fundamental idea behind the parks is native  it is  in brief that the country belongs to the people  that it is in process of making for the enrichment of the lives of all of us  
 three kinds of intention in lawmaking the nature of legislative intent remains a subject of vigorous debate  its many participants perceive the intent in different ways  in this paper  i identify the reason for such diverse perceptions  three intentions are involved in lawmaking  not one  the three intentions correspond to the three aspects of a speech act  locutionary  illocutionary and perlocutionary  the dominant approach in legal theory holds that legislative intent is a semantic  locutionary  one  a closer examination shows that it is  in fact  an illocutionary one  in the paper  i draw the consequences for legal interpretation of this more theorized model of legislative intent  
 to judge the  self judging  security exception under the gatt 1994 a systematic approach in april 2017  the trump administration initiated an investigation with regard to the effects of steel imports on united states  hereinafter  u s    national security under section 232 of the trade expansion act  if the investigation does lead to a trade restrictive measure  the u s  is likely to invoke national security as one of the justification for the potential violation of the nation s obligations under the world trade organization  hereinafter  wto    article xxi b  iii  of the general agreement on tariffs and trade  hereinafter  gatt   provides that  nothing in this agreement shall be construed    to prevent any contracting party from taking any action which it considers necessary for the protection of its essential security interests    taken in time of war or other emergency in international relations      this provision has not been formerly adjudicated under the wto  and how the wto adjudicating bodies should review an invocation of this article is highly controversial  the national security exception under the gatt has often been considered  self judging   many writers have provided analysis on the interpretation of the article xxi and its practice with regard to the extent of the  self judging  clause  it seems  however  that one critical issue in resolving this dispute the standard of judicial review developed by the wto adjudicating bodies has not been adequately addressed by scholarly attention  this article discusses how a panel should review the invocation of a national security exception from the perspectives of the standard of review analysis developed under the wto jurisprudence  this paper argues that based on the jurisprudence  the term  self judging  is a misleading one  the analytical framework of the standard of review should be utilized to judge the  self judging  invocation of the clause  under the framework  the member invoking the national security under article xxi b  iii  is entitled to a high level of deference  but this deference is not absolute  the necessity consideration is still subject to panel review consisting of both formal and substantive aspect  in addition  the timing element is subject to full panel review  there is  however  still the need for the wto adjudicating bodies to further develop the margin of discretion with regard to the national security exceptions  this paper suggests that a standard of abuse of discretion should be adopted for the review of the necessity consideration under articlexxi  b  iii   the legal provisions of section 232 do not contain sufficient procedural safeguard to meet the requirements of panel review under article xxi b  iii  of gatt  it is therefore important for the united states to ensure the conditions of the security exception under the gatt is satisfied before an action pursuant to section 232 is adopted  
 to lead or not to lead reverting president trump s retreat from the united states  traditional leading role in promoting human rights through trade traditionally  the united states has long been the promoter of human rights  especially labor rights  protection through trade measures and agreements  but the  america first  policy adopted by the trump administration has created negative impressions of the united states being hostile toward existing free trade agreements  hereinafter  ftas   and being unenthusiastic about promoting labor rights or human rights protection through ftas  the paper argues that the  america first  policy and the human rights promotion can co exist  if the united states can make it clear that its position of promoting human rights and labor rights protection through its ftas and its generalized system of preferences  hereinafter  gsp   has not been changed under the  america first  policy  it could enhance the justification of its position in renegotiating agreements with its trading partners  on the other hand  if the impression that the united states is giving up its leadership in promoting human rights and labor rights protection through trade measures and agreements is continued  the justification of its policy in renegotiating the trade agreements would be weakened  hence it should be important for the united states to remove such negative impression of retreating from its traditional leading role  
 tort reform through the back door  a critique of law and apologies in this article  we show how the biggest tort reform of the last decade was passed through the back door with the blessing of its staunchest opponents  we argue that the widely endorsed  apology law  reform a change in the national legal landscape that privileged apologies is  in fact  a mechanism of tort reform  used to limit victims  recovery and shield injurers from liability  while legal scholars overlooked this effect  commercial interests seized the opportunity and are in the process of transforming state and federal law with the unwitting support of the public  
 towards an international right to claim innocence in the past  wrongful convictions were seen as a local problem largely undeserving of national or international attention  very different legal systems have shared a common approach of emphasizing the finality of criminal convictions  thereby making it very difficult to claim innocence by relying on new evidence uncovered post trial  while international law guarantees a right to a fair trial  a presumption of innocence  and a right to appeal  no international human rights norms clearly obligate countries to allow defendants to meaningfully assert post trial claims of innocence  today  the procedures and attitudes toward claims of innocence that rely on newly discovered evidence are in flux as more countries have adopted broader remedies for convicts to claim innocence  in this essay  i describe the remarkable changes that have taken place in the past few decades  driven by a mounting number of exonerations  the development of dna technology  the work of innocence projects  and a new international dialogue on research and legal methods to address wrongful convictions  large and small countries  civil and common law countries  and countries with very different attitudes towards criminal justice have increasingly developed mechanisms to permit convicted individuals to assert factual innocence  countries draw from each other s legal standards  strategies  and responses to wrongful convictions  countries now permit innocence based challenges under various procedural labels  ranging from the writ of habeas corpus  amparo de libertad  revision  or other statutory or administrative remedies  in turn  international bodies have relaxed concerns with finality and opened the door to the broader use of innocence claims  if not recognizing a freestanding right to make use of them  in a time of growing convergence and comparison of criminal procedure approaches between countries  the movement towards permitting claims of innocence may lead to recognition of an international right to claim innocence or  more plausibly  a customary international law right to claim innocence in domestic courts  this could further incentivize the international development of claims of innocence and the adoption of remedies for wrongful convictions around the world  
 towards the  golden hour     acritical exploration of the length of preliminary examinations over the years  the conduct of preliminary examinations has gained increasing importance at the international criminal court  icc   one notable aspect in this area is the hugely diverging length of such examinations  ranging from one week for the situation in libya to 12 years  and rising  for the situation in colombia  this article critically interrogates the repeated claim of the prosecutor that the absence of any provisions regulating the length of preliminary examinations was a deliberate decision of the drafters of the rome statute  leaving her with unfettered discretion in that area  instead  it is suggested that the exercise of prosecutorial discretion in prioritizing preliminary examinations is legally limited through the obligation to ensure effective investigations  demanding reasonably swift responses because evidence vanishes over time   witnesses disappear  memories fade  and data gets lost  the  golden hour  principle   furthermore  the conduct of preliminary examinations is also limited through the legal and policy commitment to impartiality  including the appearance of impartiality  a robust debate about a structured and transparent process of prioritization at the preliminary examination stage is thus overdue  it is proposed that the prosecutor should introduce a policy commitment to conclude preliminary examinations within a defined time limit  such a policy would be an important step towards a more structured method of situation selection  and would reduce the possibility that decision making processes in more contentious situations are postponed for obscure reasons  
 towards the international rule of law in cyberspace  contrasting chinese and western approaches china and western countries have repeatedly portrayed each other as potential or actual adversaries in cyberspace  yet  both sides proclaim that they subscribe to an international consensus that cyber operations must be subjected to the rule of law  against this background  the article examines five key aspects of the rule of law in cyberspace  which are ordinarily understood as areas of contention   1  preferred method of identification and development of international law   2  competing models of cyberspace governance   3  application of sovereignty to cyberspace   4  question of militarization of cyberspace  and  5  legality of cyber espionage  our analysis demonstrates that it is inaccurate to view china and the west as sharply divided and competing camps  rather  the emerging picture reveals a web of relationships and views that reflect an overall trajectory of convergence  even if modest in scope and velocity  
 tpp  american national security and chinese soes free trade agreements  ftas  are about far more than free trade  they are about national security  a trade deal may be ambitious in liberalizing or managing cross border flows in goods  services  intellectual property  ip   and people  but to argue for or against an fta solely along the axis of free versus managed trade is to miss another vital purpose   the deal can  and indeed should  advance national security  this article makes two points  first  the trans pacific partnership  tpp  exemplifies the possibility of enhancing the national security the united states  through containment of china and its ruling chinese communist party  ccp   second  the debate over the definition of state owned enterprise  soe  is one among many illustrations in the tpp of the link between national security  trade  and containment  the 12 nations negotiating the tpp were aware of this link  and deliberated the definition of  soe   the tpp excluded the middle kingdom from the founding members  while the founders wrote the tpp rules to bind china if it subsequently joined the deal  chinese soes were of concern to them  for bona fide national security reasons  and so also were legitimate sovereign interests in providing goods and services through their own soes  the evaluation by america and its 11 tpp partners  as to which entities should be included in the scope of soe disciplines led to a set of clear rules  
 tpp 11 as a means to revive the tpp after us  withdrawal this article analyzes the means of reviving the trans pacific partnership  hereinafter  tpp   from its frustration as a result of the withdrawal of the u s  in january 2017  after briefly tracing the history of the tpp from its inception as a pacific four  hereinafter  p4   agreement between brunei darussalam  chile  new zealand and singapore in the early 2000s to its enlargement in 2008 by the united states  hereinafter  u s    declaration to join the tpp negotiation  the conclusion of the negotiation with its signature in february 2016  and then through the u s  withdrawal  the article traces the developments after the u s  withdrawal to revive the tpp without the u s   focusing on the tpp 11 trade ministers  pledge to revive the tpp in may and the following chief negotiators  meeting in july  the article then explores the possible options for realizing the tpp with its original 11 negotiating parties excepting the u s  it concludes with the assertion that the tpp should be entered into force even without the u s   as it should become a model of the 21st century regional trade agreement  as envisioned by the u s  
 trade and sustainability  the impact of the international tropical timber agreements on exports environmental sustainability standards are often portrayed as a hindrance to trade and growth  a set of novel international environmental agreements  ieas   the international tropical timber agreements  ittas   seeks to promote both  the ittas encourage international trade for member nations while requiring sustainable timber practices  this paper uses the ittas as a case study to examine whether ieas can lead to environmental cooperation at the same time as increasing trade  membership in both the 1983 and 1994 ittas is examined for an effect on timber exports  the analysis is conducted using panel data for 165 countries between 1970 and 2011 while controlling for year fixed effects  country fixed effects and country specific trend terms  estimated itta effects vary by itta year  timber category and country type  logs exports fell for both tropical and non tropical country members  but these decreases were offset by increases in other timber category exports  tropical country members increased plywood exports  while non tropical country itta members increased exports of sawn wood and veneer sheets  total exports of targeted timber were unaffected in non tropical member countries  while the 1983 itta increased total exports for tropical countries  these results together suggest that the sustainability clauses entailed in ittas have not decreased total timber exports from member countries  but have shifted exports across timber categories  
 trade marks with a reputation and famous marks  differences in approach between the european union  poland and the united states in relation to the principle of speciality the protection of a trade mark with a reputation in the european union law and of a famous trade mark in the us federal law is broader than that granted to ordinary trade marks  the scope of protection of marks with a reputation and famous mark indicates that the principle of speciality is enforced in the federal us law to a larger extent than in the eu law and  in turn  in some member states of the european union  in particular poland  arguably  this difference results from the differences between the definition of a trade mark with a reputation  used in the european union  and a famous mark  used the united states  the main difference in us law is that the fame of a mark is defined globally with respect to the general consuming public of the united states  whereas the court of justice has indicated that in the european union whether a trade mark has a reputation is assessed by reference to a significant part of the public concerned with the products or services covered by the specification  thus  in the eu law  the reputation of a trade mark may be perceived with respect to a narrow group of the public  for example specialists in a given field  
 transaction costs in the evolution of transnational polycentric governance polycentric systems of governance may help address two key challenges in the transnational governance of socioecological systems  the problems of fragmentation and fit  but there is limited understanding of the processes through which polycentric governance systems emerge  this paper draws on institutional economics and accounts of international regime formation to develop an ideal type model of the evolution of transnational polycentric governance  in particular  the model highlights systematically different transaction costs across different phases of polycentric governance evolution  these costs result in important trade offs between building a broad coalition during agenda setting and addressing complexity in implementation  the plausibility of the model is probed using the case of reducing emissions from deforestation and forest degradation  redd    drawing on global level data on redd  collaboration  as well as fieldwork in central kalimantan  indonesia  this case suggests that low transaction costs in the agenda setting phase led to a confused vision for what redd  should be  ultimately hampering implementation  
 transatlantic data privacy law international flows of personal information are more significant than ever  but differences in transatlantic data privacy law imperil this data trade  the resulting policy debate has led the eu to set strict limits on transfers of personal data to any non eu country including the united states that lacks sufficient privacy protections  bridging the transatlantic data divide is therefore a matter of the greatest significance  in exploring this issue  this article analyzes the respective legal identities constructed around data privacy in the eu and the united states  it identifies profound differences in the two systems  images of the individual as bearer of legal interests  the eu has created a privacy culture around  rights talk  that protects its  data subjects   in the eu  moreover  rights talk forms a critical part of the postwar european project of creating the identity of a european citizen  in the united states  in contrast  the focus is on a  marketplace discourse  about personal information and the safeguarding of  privacy consumers   in the united states  data privacy law focuses on protecting consumers in a data marketplace  this article uses its models of rights talk and marketplace discourse to analyze how the eu and united states protect their respective data subjects and privacy consumers  although the differences are great  there is still a path forward  a new set of institutions and processes can play a central role in developing mutually acceptable standards of data privacy  the key documents in this regard are the general data protection regulation  an eu wide standard that becomes binding in 2018  and the privacy shield  an eu u s  treaty signed in 2016  these legal standards require regular interactions between the eu and united states and create numerous points for harmonization  coordination  and cooperation  the gdpr and privacy shield also establish new kinds of governmental networks to resolve conflicts  the future of international data privacy law rests on the development of new understandings of privacy within these innovative structures  
 transformative constitutionalism  not only in the global south originally a south african  brand   transformative constitutionalism is increasingly presented as a new  distinctively southern paradigm of constitutionalism  yet  it remains unclear what transformative constitutionalism entails  this article argues that transformative constitutions differ from traditional liberal constitutions by conceptualizing the constitution as a comprehensive order for a more just and equal society and a tool to prompt state action to that purpose as much as restrain it  so understood  the constitutional law of a number of northern systems such as germany s should also be understood as transformative in important aspects  an advantage of opening up our understanding of transformative constitutionalism in this way is the comparative perspective it offers  unsurprisingly  courts and lawyers in different countries have approached transformative constitutionalism differently  while some have taken a more  traditional  law focused approach  others have opted for a more collaborative one  within the traditional legal model  exemplified by the german case  courts seek to preserve those features typically associated with judicial rather than political processes  for example the individualized nature of proceedings  in contrast  the indian collaborative approach often involves negotiation between different stakeholders and emphasizes legal flexibility  each model comes with a different approach to judicial legitimacy and its own downsides and advantages  this article sketches out some first thoughts how we might go about taking the best of both worlds  once we recognize how global the transformative project truly is  to do so  i suggest we should seek to avoid the overly hierarchical german approach with its problematic consequences for democratic empowerment  while at the same time attempting to preserve the key role of individual rights and law as a specialized discipline of its own thus providing the foundation for an independent source of professional judicial legitimacy  
 transforming crime based deportation why not rid the united states of criminal noncitizens and the disorder they cause  because  scholars urge  immigrants reduce crime rates  deporting noncitizens with criminal convictions costs far more than it is worth  and discarding immigrants when they become inconvenient is wrong  despite the force of these responses  reform efforts have made little headway  crime based deportation appears entrenched  can it be transformed  rather than modified at the margins  transformation is possible  but only if crime based deportation is reenvisioned as the prerogative of local governments  national transformation  this article shows  is a dead end  when the problem of immigrant crime is digested at the national level  under the rubric of  the national interest  where noncitizen interests do not count by definition there are numerous  rational  reasons why a self interested citizenry would want to deport noncitizens  even for minor crimes  additionally  whatever rational reasons exist are exaggerated by the national media  which gives the rare violent crime committed by an immigrant outsized national attention  the danger posed by this distorted media reality was highlighted by donald trump throughout his campaign for president  trump s establishment of an office to publicize crimes committed by deportable noncitizens will make the problem more acute  local governments  by contrast  can be more concrete  flexible  and pragmatic  they are apt to think in terms of residents and community  rather than citizen versus alien  local residents think about neighbors  classmates  and fellow churchgoers  and the economic and social contributions of noncitizens who run afoul of the law loom larger in the local calculus than the national one  were local governments granted responsibility for crime based deportation  the humanity  value  and membership of immigrants who commit crimes would be more likely to enter the conversation about appropriate responses  helping to transform crime based deportation  
 transforming land taking disputes in socialist asia  engaging an authoritarian state few studies have responded to the calls by sociolegal scholars to explore how disputes evolve  this article takes up the challenge by examining how intermediaries in socialist asia resolve land taking disputes that are intractable for administrative appeals and courts  exploring alternatives to state based dispute resolution is a pressing issue for conflicts that pit citizens against authoritarian regimes  using in depth interviews  this article investigates how intermediaries such as retired state officials navigate in and around authoritarian regimes  flattening power asymmetries between citizens and land officials  this analysis draws from  links  and advances three literatures that examine dispute resolution in different ways  the sociolegal  naming  blaming  and claiming  literature examines the trajectory of disputes  regulatory studies use legitimacy expectations to analyze how disputants evaluate and prioritize competing regulatory frameworks  and the collective identity literature analyzes how communities respond to disputes  this article contributes to the literature by developing a theoretical framework that explains how intermediaries circumvent conceptual differences and transform disputes  the findings compel researchers to consider the use of intermediaries as an alternative to state sponsored dispute resolution in authoritarian settings  
 transitional justice plus cyberjustice   justice 2   the increased use of information and communication technologies arguably represents important opportunities for the field of transitional justice  notably with respect to the optimization of existing mechanisms and the development of new ones  this article focuses on state based and typically very formal mechanisms  namely international  internationalized and national criminal tribunals as well as truth and reconciliation commissions  these institutions often apply and engage with international law and operate with the involvement or under the close scrutiny of the international community  moreover  they can be expected to be the first ones to embrace insights from the field of cyberjustice to a significant extent  enhancing access to and participation in such mechanisms  rendering them more cost efficient and facilitating information sharing would correspond to generally accepted norms relating to both international human rights and justice  however  cyberjustice initiatives may also entrench an already common  toolkit approach  in the field of transitional justice  this article builds on recent critiques of the dominant legalistic and normatively driven transitional justice paradigm and argues that transitional justice   cyberjustice hence risks furthering a technocratic top down approach that unduly limits creative solutions  by adopting a critical legal pluralistic approach that conceives individuals as law creative actors and that is cognizant of the close relationship between means and ends  the article imagines ways of benefiting from the promises of transitional justice   cyberjustice  
 transparency policies of the european medicines agency  has the paradigm shifted  this article reflects on the state of play as regards access to non summary clinical trial data in the european union  eu   in particular  it examines the scope of access under the recent transparency policies of the european medicines agency  ema  that attempt to break away from the presumptively confidential treatment of clinical trial data  in light of the emerging case law of the court of justice of the european union on clinical trial data disclosure  it remains highly uncertain what data  and under what conditions  can be lawfully released by the ema  under the applicable regulations  the scope of the accessible data depends on the interpretation of commercially confidential information the notion derived from the exception to the fundamental right of access to documents  accordingly  the analysis focuses on the application of this exception  taking into account the specifics of clinical data  the context in which disclosure occurs  and the interests that are at stake  the main complexity is found in defining the scope of the relevant and legitimate interests to be balanced when applying the exception  overall  it is argued that the current regulatory framework does not provide a sufficient legal basis to support the objectives pursued by the ema s policies  
 treatment of biometrically processed personal data  problem of uniform practice under eu personal data protection law the application of biometric technologies has become almost commonplace  they can help to raise the security level and make identification and authentication procedures easy  fast and convenient  biometric technologies are widely used to process personal data  they are particularly favoured in business  the present research primarily conducted in the corporate sphere has revealed that treatment of biometric data by individual nation states essentially differs  some nation states have chosen to prohibit any use of biometric technologies in processing personal data  however  such use is acceptable in certain cases where the processing entails no sensitive data or threat to personal privacy  thus  the question of data attribution to sensitive data becomes relevant  the valid eu law on personal data protection expresis verbis does not regulate processing biometric data in detail leaving member states freedom of choice  meanwhile  the general data protection regulation leaves no alternatives  ascribing biometric data to sensitive data  subject to a prohibition for processing that may be deemed an extreme position and justification of which is uncertain  therefore  the authors of the publication present their insights and evaluations by classifying personal data processing by means of biometric technologies into two groups  such classification directly affects evaluation of personal data processing from the legal point of view  the key conclusion made by the authors is that in certain cases where the risk to privacy is minor  the use of biometric technologies to process personal data should not be prohibited  the practice of non prohibition would encourage the use of biometric technologies equally applicable in all eu member states  the present context has prompted the authors to discuss possible consequences and effects of the adopted regulation and suggest carrying out reliable research in the field and urging an immediate discussion of stakeholders   c  2017 darius stitilis   marius laurinaitis  published by elsevier ltd  all rights reserved  
 triaging the law  developing the common law on the supreme court of india legal precedent serves as the foundation of the common law  judges provide their reasoning through precedent  citing cases to support their conclusion while distinguishing between cases cited by that counsel in favor of an opposing result  legal precedent also provides the mechanism by which judges communicate with one another  at the same time providing guidance to prospective litigants and the practicing bar  this process is particularly important for supreme courts  whose decisions bind all lower courts within their jurisdiction  for this reason  in most common law jurisdictions  the supreme court decides relatively few cases but draws heavily on precedent for the opinions it issues  the supreme court in india stands in contrast to its counterparts in countries such as the united states and canada in that it decides thousands  rather than tens  of cases  examining the universe of court decisions from 1950 2010  we find that the court elects not to cite precedent in nearly half its opinions  in turn  these opinions without citation to precedent are rarely subsequently cited  however  there is a second set of decisions that is more analogous to u s  supreme court decisions  these decisions do cite prior decisions and are cited by later cases  opinions that do cite precedent gravitate to older opinions  whose salience often endures for decades  these findings suggest the court is constrained in its ability to process a heavy caseload  and makes strategic decisions as to which opinions to emphasize through its use of precedent  
 trial and error  how courts have shaped prior appropriation in new mexico this systematic review of new mexico prior appropriation case law from 1883 to the present employs a thematic chronology in four parts spanning approximately three decades each  including the following topics  part one covers the initial conflict between prior appropriation and riparian common law and early interpretations of the 1907 water act  in part two  courts contrast the 1907 act with the old arid region doctrine and justify the integration of groundwater into prior appropriation  diminishing supplies and increasing usage drive part three s concentration on proceedings to change places of use and points of diversion  at times deferring issues of priority or subordinating prior appropriation to other systems of allocation  part four explores progress of general stream adjudications  affirmation of prior appropriation against equitable apportionment and common use  and the expansion of power for priority enforcement subject to political barriers  the conclusion distinguishes between prior appropriation s vitality in principle and in practice  with a call to the new mexico legislature to enact statutes and provide adequate funding to meet new mexico s present and future water needs  
 troubled relationships under the gats  tensions between market access  article xvi   national treatment  article xvii   and domestic regulation  article vi  the general agreement on trade in services  gats  was adopted in order to establish meaningful liberalization rules  while preserving the right of members to regulate  to that end  three provisions form the centerpiece of liberalization  market access  article xvi gats   national treatment  article xvii gats   and domestic regulation  article vi gats   although these provisions contain different obligations  in certain conditions they can overlap  how this issue is resolved could undermine the delicate balance between liberalization and the right to regulate  as the gats provides no guidance  the task of determining the applicable rules has been delegated to the world trade organization  wto  adjudicating bodies  this paper examines how the three provisions have been interpreted  and analyzes the most applicable way to address the diversity of barriers to trade in services

 turning the witness stand into a speaker s platform  victim participation in the norwegian legal system as exemplified by the trial against anders behring breivik in this article  we investigate how victims pursue legal participation when they are confronted by legal barriers and dilemmas that arise from tensions between legal formality and lay expectations and contributions of legal proceedings  we use the trial against anders behring breivik as a case  breivik placed a bomb in norway s government district before he shot and killed 69 people on a small island  we analyze interviews with 31 victims who testified against breivik in court  we argue that the circumstances of the trial against breivik can be characterized as  ideal  in terms of victims  rights  the exceptionality of this case facilitates a focus on unquestioned obstacles to victim participation concerning the professionalization of the legal system  we question the presumption prevalent among some theorists that the professionalization of the legal system excludes lay participation  by arguing that legal formality both alienate and empower lay participation

 unbundling efficient breach  an experiment current law and economics scholarship analyzes efficient breach cases monolithically  the standard analysis holds that breach is efficient when performance of a contract generates a negative total surplus for the parties  however  by simplistically grouping efficient breach cases as of a single kind  the prior literature overlooks that gain seeking breaches might be different from loss avoiding breaches  to capture these different motives  we designed a novel game called the contract breach game where we exogenously varied the reasons for the breachpursuing a gain or avoiding a lossunder a specific performance remedy  results from an incentivized laboratory experiment indicate that the motives behind the breach induce sizable differences in behavior  subjects are less willing to renegotiate when facing gain seeking than loss avoiding breaches  and the compensation premium obtained by the promisee is higher  our analysis suggests that inequality aversion is an important driver of our results  indeed  inequality averse subjects accept low offers more often in cases of loss avoiding breaches than gain seeking breaches  these results give us insight into the preferences and expectations of ordinary people in a case of a breach  
 unbundling the regime complex  the effects of private authority the work on regime complexes    loosely coupled regimes linked through non hierarchical relationships   provides a lens for understanding the increasing density of international rules and institutions  however  the role of private authority in the regime complex   situations where non state actors set rules or standards that other actors adopt   has only recently received academic attention  in this article  we unbundle  the concept of the regime complex in two novel ways  firstly  we argue that an accurate depiction of any regime complex must also include private authority  secondly  using examples from environmental governance  we carefully elaborate four specific mechanisms through which public and private authority interact  demonstrating the ways in which private authority can improve the problem solving capacity of regime complexes  in short  a full understanding of the contributions of private authority to solving environmental problems requires examining its interactions with public rules and institutions  
 unconstitutional change of government  a new crime within the jurisdiction of the african criminal court one of the most interesting and controversial crimes that belong to the subject matter jurisdiction of the newly to be established african criminal chamber is undoubtedly the crime of unconstitutional change of government  this article explores the question why this offence is upgraded to the regional level of criminal law enforcement  after all  any criminalization of the conduct at a regional level and the concomitant inclusion of the offence in the jurisdiction of regional courts raises questions about the right of foreign intervention in internal political affairs and the curtailment of the right to rebel  the crime of unconstitutional change of government is tested against these principles and it is concluded that they do not impede criminalization  nor the elevation of the crime to a regional level  in search of a positive argument in defence of the inclusion of the crime within the jurisdiction of the african court  i contend that the best explanation is that insurgencies are not contained to single states but are inclined to spread to other countries  in view of the specific african experience  where endemic conflicts have proved to be contagious  it is clear that states have a common interest in suppressing both the dynamic and static form of unconstitutional change of government  
 undeniable obligations to gaia  us remaining investment obligations after its withdrawal from the paris agreement the hostility of the united states  hereinafter  u s    toward the paris agreement comes mainly from the fear that it will somehow lose its competitiveness and be taken advantage of by the rest of the world  the environmental concerns that make the paris agreement necessary are recognized on the condition that the u s  can take the lead and renegotiate a new deal  otherwise  the u s  will seek to be  the cleanest and most environment friendly country on earth  solely by itself  two messages from the u s  withdrawal are clear  the u s  policy will favor the conventional energy sector over green energies and prefers a unilateral approach to environmental protection  a policy change in environmental protection  featuring a more economic oriented and  america first  outlook  will follow  the u s  withdrawal echoes the presidential executive order to reverse or review climate change policies adopted by the obama administration  this policy change will have legal consequences under both domestic and international legal frameworks  this essay explores whether or to what extent the withdrawal alleviates u s  obligations concerning global warming  
 under the cloak of brain science  risk assessments  parole  and the powerful guise of objectivity this note examines the adoption of two psychological risk assessment protocols used on  lifers  by the california board of parole hearings in preparation for parole suitability hearings  probation and parole agencies employ risk assessment protocols across state and federal jurisdictions to measure the likelihood that an individual will pose a danger to society if released from prison  by examining the adoption and recent reformulation of risk assessment protocols in california  this note considers some of the myriad demands that courts and administrative agencies place on brain science  applying the california parole process as a parable of such pressures  this note argues that brain science has a unique capacity to supersede legal inquiry itself  and thus should only be used in legal and administrative settings with extreme caution  
 understanding and treating offenders with serious mental illness in public sector mental health this article begins with the history of the rise and fall of the state hospitals and subsequent criminalization of persons with serious mental illness  smi   currently  there is a belief among many that incarceration has not been as successful as hoped in reducing crime and drug use  both for those with and those without smi  moreover  overcrowding in correctional facilities has become a serious problem necessitating a solution  consequently  persons with smi in the criminal justice system are now being released in large numbers to the community and hopefully treated by public sector mental health  the issues to consider when releasing incarcerated persons with smi into the community are as follows  diversion and mental health courts  the expectation that the mental health system will assume responsibility  providing asylum and sanctuary  the capabilities  limitations  and realistic treatment goals of community outpatient psychiatric treatment for offenders with smi  the need for structure  the use of involuntary commitments  including assisted outpatient treatment  conservatorship and guardianship  liaison between treatment and criminal justice personnel  appropriately structured  monitored  and supportive housing  management of violence  and 24 hour structured in patient care  copyright  c  2017 john wiley   sons  ltd  
 understanding guilty pleas through the lens of social science the adjudication of crime by guilty plea has been on the rise globally for at least the last 30 years  few countries  however  have accepted pleas to the degree of the united states  whose highest court recently acknowledged a criminal justice system near synonymous with a  system of pleas  not a system of trials   lafler v  cooper  2012  p  3   the present article provides an overview of this justice system wherein many pleas are bargained between the defense and prosecution  our purpose here is twofold  first to review psychological and other social scientific research on the theoretical and practical reasons underlying the process of pleading guilty  and second  to identify research questions and methods that have yet to be  but need to be  asked and conducted in relation to guilty pleas  
 understanding nautilus s reasonable certainty standard  requirements for linguistic and physical definiteness of patent claims patent applicants must satisfy a variety of requirements to obtain a patent from the u s  patent and trademark office  uspto   the definiteness requirement forces applicants to describe their inventions in unambiguous terms so that other inventors will understand the scope of granted patent rights  although the statutory provision for the definiteness requirement has been stable for many years  the supreme court s decision in nautilus v  biosig instruments altered the doctrine  the court abrogated the federal circuit s insoluble ambiguity standard and replaced it with a new reasonable certainty standard  various district courts have applied the new standard in different ways  indicating the need for further clarification  this note argues that  following the establishment of the reasonable certainty standard  courts may understand the definiteness requirement under a two part framework of linguistic and physical definiteness  which are both required for claims to be definite  a claim fails the linguistic definiteness requirement if it is open to multiple constructions and one construction is not clearly correct  additionally  a claim fails the physical definiteness requirement if it uses comparative terms or involves ambiguous spatial relationships not limited to a narrow range  
 understanding ulterior mens rea  future conduct intention is conditional intention where criminal offences such as attempt and conspiracy require a defendant  d  to intend future conduct  d s intention will always be conditional  d s intention may be explicitly conditional  e g  d intends to rob the shop  but only if unable to pay her rent   or implicitly conditional  e g  d intends to rob the shop  but if asked  would not do so if she found it surrounded by police   rather than interpreting and defining conditional intention as synonymous with all future conduct intention  however  courts and commentators have too often approached it as unique  separate and problematic  this has led to problems of inconsistency in application  and simple incoherence  this article sets out and defends a model of conditional intention as future conduct intention  and as the key to understanding and applying ulterior mens rea  
 unexpressed intention and contract construction many contract disputes concern issues of unexpressed intention  the express terms of the contract do not directly answer the particular question raised by the circumstances  in this article we argue that there are different bases for resolving such issues in the law of contract and we present a hierarchical framework for understanding their interaction   construction   plays an important role  but it becomes clear that construction is not a homogeneous process  rather  it performs different functions in relation to the different bases  these functions include  to apply contract doctrine  to rebut presumptions of intention  and the interpretative function  using this framework  we critique the controversial views of lord hoffmann in attorney general of belize v belize telecom ltd  on terms implied in fact  and transfield shipping inc v mercator shipping inc  the achilleas   on the first limb of hadley v baxendale   in both cases  lord hoffmann assigned construction a role different from that which it has conventionally been understood to perform  
 unjust enrichment in the  fairchild enclave  international energy group ltd v zurich insurance plc in international energy group v zurich insurance  the supreme court considered the implications of the special rule in fairchild v glenhaven funeral services ltd for insurers  for employers  liability  the question for the court was whether  in the light of its earlier decision in durham v bai  run off  ltd  insurers could be held liable for employees  mesothelioma claims  even if the employer was not insured throughout the period of employment  the seven justices unanimously held that insurers  liability was proportionate to the period of insurance  in reaching that result  the majority recognised that the insurers were entitled to equitable recoupment  from insured employers in respect of periods during which they were uninsured  this note critiques the recoupment right with an unjust enrichment lens  
 unorthodox civil procedure  modern multidistrict litigation s place in the textbook understandings of procedure multidistrict litigation  mdl  is unorthodox  modern civil procedure  it is an old but new procedural tool that significantly disrupts decades of worked out doctrinal equilibria  and  now comprising a shocking 39  of the cases on the civil docket  mdls warrant more attention than they have received  the mdl puts a thumb on the scale of nationalism over federalism  consent over adversity  procedural exceptionalism over transsubstantivity  and common law over the federal rules  in other words  the mdl takes what has generally been the losing side of procedure s big theoretical and doctrinal debates  it is a symptom of deeper pressures on the system to recalibrate procedure s traditional baselines  mdls are modern because they see the need for a national  not state centered  approach to questions of procedure  they disrupt traditional legal relationships  turning judges and lawyers into collaborative partners in practical problem solving and creating a new judicial elite among the federal judges chosen to lead them  mdls exemplify procedural exceptionalism a type of litigation that judges insist is too different from case to case to be managed by the transsubstantive values that form the very soul of the federal rules  instead  judges develop their own special mdl procedures yet this new kind of procedural law is rarely treated as precedential or even subject to customary appellate review  these deviations from the  textbook  have caused academic anxiety  scholars worry about lack of transparency  loss of the individual claim  and the dearth of uniform procedural law  many judges who try mdls  on the other hand  view them favorably often as the only way to ensure access to court for massive claims on a national scale and also as highly enjoyable judicial work  this article relies on interviews with mdl judges to offer a new set of counterpoints to the academic criticism  the article also sets mdls in the broader context of  unorthodox lawmaking  a phenomenon documented in the legislative context but not yet in procedure  mdls  like omnibus legislation and other forms of nontraditional lawmaking  are responses to pressure on the system  some way in which legal rules have not kept up with the obstacles of modern times when the consensus is that congress and the courts must nevertheless take action  all of these unorthodox vehicles thus tend to operate outside the relevant rules  raising questions about the value of the rules themselves  they raise the question  what do we care about most  is it access to court  or  analagously  the production of legislation   or is procedure for procedure s own sake the more important value even if upholding that value means fewer cases get resolved  mdls highlight this tension  they are likely more symptom than cause of procedure s modern challenges  
 unstacking the deck  administrative summary judgment and political control the administrative procedure act s provisions on formal adjudication give individuals charged in administrative enforcement actions the right to an in person oral hearing  but not always  agency prosecutors can circumvent formal hearing procedures without the consent of the defendant by resolving cases on  administrative summary judgment   a 1971 harvard law review article endorsed this procedure as a way for agency prosecutors to avoid  futile  hearings  and courts have upheld it based on the same technocratic justification  yet administrative procedure is not merely an instrument to be expertly calibrated by administrators  it is a mechanism of political control  when congress assigns enforcement of a given program to a formal adjudication regime  it is exercising its authority to  stack the deck   giving defendants access to elaborate procedural protections and limiting or channeling the enforcement program  administrative summary judgment  unstacks the deck  it unwinds congress s procedural controls and allows an agency to recalibrate its enforcement priorities  at the securities and exchange commission  many administrative proceedings are now resolved on  summary disposition  without any in person hearings  the recent expansion of summary dispositions has facilitated a broad shift in the agency s enforcement priorities toward easy to prosecute offenses  enabling the agency to show congress a  record number of enforcement actions  year after year  that figure has  apparently  significant political value  but does not indicate anything about the effectiveness of the sec s enforcement program  setting enforcement priorities is a critical function for agencies like the sec that are charged with enforcing a vast and complex array of legal obligations  but which have resources to pursue only a relatively small number of possible violations  securities scholars have long debated the sec s enforcement priorities  but have overlooked the role administrative adjudication procedure plays in shaping those priorities as both a vehicle for congressional control and administrative rebellion  
 untangling the international responsibility of the european union and its member states in the world trade organization post lisbon  a competence remedy model the aim of this article is to shed light on the legally important and politically sensitive question of the respective responsibility of the european union  eu  and its member states for the performance of world trade organization  wto  obligations  specifically  it seeks to challenge two propositions often found in the literature on the basis of a rigorous analysis of wto dispute settlement practice  first  the claim that the eu s exclusive responsibility for breaches of wto law by its member states has been widely accepted by other wto members and dispute settlement organs is not well grounded in existing wto jurisprudence nor supported by recent post lisbon wto dispute settlement practice  second  and contrary to what some eu law scholars appear to suggest  what has been decisive in assigning international responsibility in the wto is not the division of external  treaty making  competences between the eu and its member states but  rather  the allocation and exercise of internal  treaty infringing treaty performing  competences  in this sense  the treaty of lisbon has not fundamentally changed how the issue of eu member states international responsibility is to be approached in the wto  insofar as the eu member states remain members of that organization in their own right  with this in mind  a redefined  competence remedy  model is put forward to help us untangle  who is responsible  to third parties for breaches of wto law

 us case law and legal precedent affirming the due process rights of immigrants fleeing persecution the political discourse on domestic immigration policy has shifted rapidly in recent years  mirrored by similar shifts in the geopolitical climate worldwide  however  a nuanced assessment of the legal basis backing such rhetoric is sorely lacking  this article examines the historical  legal  and case law precedent as it pertains specifically to immigrants who are fleeing persecution and residing within the united states  due process rights emerged from the fifth  sixth  and fourteenth constitutional amendments and have been expanded to include this population through several sequential united states supreme court cases  we review the 1951 convention related to the status of refugees and 1967 protocol relating to the status of refugees and examine subsequent case law and legal precedent  we then present evidence documenting widespread violations of due process rights for immigrants fleeing persecution  specifically  we address the right to a fair hearing for individuals fearing for their lives upon return to their home country  the right against wrongful detainment  and the right to apply for asylum regardless of religion or country of origin  we conclude by addressing potential counterarguments to our thesis  future directions  and the role of forensic psychiatrists  
 us tight oil and gas and its global impact the us tight oil revolution has not only turned conventional wisdom on its head domestically  but has also changed the global direction of trade in crude oil  petroleum products  natural gas liquids  ngls   natural gas and liquefied natural gas  lng   the impact is so great that this revolution has led to a sea change in all of these markets  leading to lower prices  and has changed energy geopolitics in the process  in oil  the main change relates not only to quantity  but also the quality of crude  with significant implications for organization of petroleum exporting countries  opec   in petroleum products  us exports have competed head on with the main refiners in europe  the middle east and asia  the main change in ngls has been the taking of market share from some opec producers in central and latin america and the collapse of the pricing system  in natural gas  the main impact was the curtailment of landlocked canadian gas  while mexico became awash with cheap us gas  in lng  the main change was the breakup of the old pricing system that linked lng prices to oil prices  the impact is far reaching and only now are we realizing the significance of the impact of the us tight oil and gas revolution on global energy markets  
 using biometric based identification systems in brazil  a review on low cost fingerprint techniques on the go automatic authentication has become an essential service in several public areas  however  although the technology related with this kind of service has evolved  the price tag of its use is not affordable for most countries  in the so called  under developed  counties  such as brazil  south africa and india  for example  registration systems are often paper based and or cover only a fraction of the population  thus  the reality is that there is an increasing gap into the usage of such technologies amongst different countries and it can be a factor that makes development more difficult and  therefore  less inclusive  one of the main technologies used for automatic identity prediction is based on biometrics analysis  which can distinguish physical or behavioural features to help overcome the traditional paper based identity systems  despite the limitations already mentioned  brazil is known to have introduced several different uses of biometric based technologies for authentication  however  the use of these technologies is not always ideal and  since the population size is a key factor  it is essential to select the most affordable option which is not necessarily the most adequate for the country s needs  this paper will focus on establishing what biometricbased solutions exist in brazil today   highlighting the main challenges  as well as briefly proposing a new prototype for mobile fingerprint acquisition   c  2016 marjory da costa abreu and stephen smith  published by elsevier ltd  all rights reserved  
 using eminent domain to refinance underwater mortgages  a welfare analysis this paper evaluates the welfare consequences of the proposed use of eminent domain to forcibly refinance  underwater  mortgages  mortgages for which the remaining loan balance exceeds the value of the house   our results show that  in the absence of transaction costs  the policy unambiguously increases welfare  regardless of the amount of compensation paid to lenders  however  when takings generate transaction costs  we show that in a competitive mortgage market where borrowers fully finance the needed compensation through lump sum taxes  welfare is decreasing in transaction costs  but more generous compensation for lenders may either increase or decrease social welfare   c  2017 elsevier inc  all rights reserved

 vagueness and discretion in the scope of the eia directive article 2 1   the core obligation imposed by the environmental impact assessment directive  requires that projects  likely to have a significant effect on the environment  are subject to an environmental assessment  the vague term  significant effect  confers a broad discretion in interpreting the scope of the directive  which the european commission has identified as problematic  this article examines the role of this discretion in the regulatory framework  in order to contribute to a better understanding of the nature and purpose of environmental impact assessment  the analysis is conducted through the lens of endicott s theory on  vagueness  in law  which helps to understand the nature of article 2 1  discretion  it demonstrates that discretion is integral to the framework rather than a side effect of the formulation of article 2 1  and that it is valuable because it creates space to consider a vast array of factors in the assessment of  significance  and promotes deliberation on environmental values

 valuing sacred tribal waters within prior appropriation throughout the world water plays a central role in the spirituality of indigenous peoples  focusing on the american west  this article first describes how tribal water needs touch upon the sacred and then explains how both federal law and state prior appropriation doctrine fail to adequately protect these important sacred views of water  pivoting away from the classic federal law arguments  the article then advocates for an evolution in state water law regimes to provide yet unrecognized protections for tribal sacred waters  because international law plays an increasing role in this issue  the article also explores case studies from ireland  kenya  and new zealand  where sacred waters are being protected from development  using these international models for inspiration  the article then focuses on specific first steps where prior appropriation law can begin its evolution  
 victim legal representation before the icc and eccc victims have often been the justification of international criminal trials  but only recently allowed to participate in proceedings  with the provision of victim participation at the international criminal court and the extraordinary chambers in the courts of cambodia there is a growing literature in international criminal justice exploring the role of victims in such proceedings  this article provides an empirical contribution to this literature  drawing from fieldwork conducted in uganda and cambodia to examine the role of legal representatives in furthering victims  rights and interests within international criminal courts  the article analyses the concepts of victim agency and voice and the practice of representation within the courts  assessing the extent to which victims are able to exercise agency and voice through representation  it argues that victims are having their agency limited by restrictions placed on their ability to choose representatives  and that the introduction of common representation has collectivized victims  voices  leading to disputes surrounding who may legitimately represent victims  
 victim perpetrator reconciliation agreements what can muslim majority jurisdictions and the prc learn from each other  as states that use the death penalty liberally in a world that increasingly favours abolition  the muslim majority jurisdictions that are strict exponents of islamic law and the people s republic of china share a crucial commonality  their frequent use of victim perpetrator reconciliation agreements to remove convicted murderers from the threat of execution  in both cases  rather than a prisoner s last chance at escaping execution being recourse to executive clemency  victim perpetrator reconciliation agreements fulfil largely the same purpose  together with providing means of compensating victims for economic loss  and enabling the state concerned to reduce execution numbers without formally limiting the death penalty s scope in law  utilizing the functionalist approach of comparative law methodology  this article compares the 13 death penalty retentionist nations that have incorporated islamic law principles into their positive criminal law with the people s republic of china  as to the functions underpinning victim perpetrator reconciliation agreements in death penalty cases  
 victims versus veterans  agency  resistance and legacies of timor leste s truth commission this article examines the politics of victims  rights in timor leste a decade after timor s official independence from indonesia  using data from work and ethnographic fieldwork in timor from 2002 to 2013  the article asks why timor s victims  rights movement has had such difficulties achieving its goals  and whether and in what ways timor s truth commission has contributed to these difficulties  it argues that timor s victims  rights movement has floundered because of the emergence of a gendered victim veteran binary in timor  in which the  victim  is defined in negative relation to the  veteran  as one who did not resist indonesian rule and is devalued accordingly  it further argues that timor s truth commission unintentionally contributed to this binary through its discourse of innocent  suffering victimhood  the article concludes by examining how truth commissions can engage with the theme of past resistance to violence  so as to prevent the emergence of similar victim veteran binaries elsewhere  
 violence and abuse against people with disabilities  a comparison of the approaches of the european court of human rights and the united nations committee on the rights of persons with disabilities this paper explores how  and how effectively  two systems of international law have addressed exploitation  violence and abuse of people with mental disabilities  the two international systems reviewed were the council of europe s european court of human rights and the united nations committee on the rights of persons with disabilities  the two issues dealt with are  a  forced institutionalisation and denial of community based services and  b  medically sanctioned treatment as abuse or violence  the paper offers a comparative analysis of the way in which the two bodies have dealt with exploitation  violence and abuse of people with disabilities  and offers recommendations as to how the two bodies could adjust their approaches to come into closer alignment   c  2017 published by elsevier ltd

 war at sea  nineteenth century laws for twenty first century wars  while most law on the conduct of hostilities has been heavily scrutinized in recent years  the law dealing with armed conflict at sea has been largely ignored  this is not surprising  there have been few naval conflicts since 1945  and those that have occurred have been limited in scale  none has involved combat between major maritime powers  nevertheless  navies have tripled in number since then  and today there are growing tensions between significant naval powers  there is a risk of conflict at sea  conditions have changed since 1945  but the law has not developed in that time  elements of it  especially that regulating economic warfare at sea  seem outdated and it is not clear that the law is well placed to regulate so called hybrid warfare at sea  it seems timely to review the law  to confirm that which is appropriate and to develop that which is not  perhaps a new edition of the san remo manual would be timely

 westernized women   the construction of muslim women s dissent in us asylum law this comment examines a group of asylum cases in which the applicants  women of muslim heritage  were portrayed or understood as westernized because of their beliefs in gender equality  this comment utilizes the work of female scholars of muslim heritage  whose work on gender  islam  and orientalism has provided critical insights which can help us understand how women of muslim heritage are constructed in u s  asylum law  these scholars have described an imagined binary between the liberated western woman and the oppressed muslim woman which this comment argues has been replicated and reinforced in asylum law  this comment explores how intersectionality theory can provide a framework that helps explain how the asylum claims of women of muslim heritage are often depoliticized along both gender and racialized lines  this comment argues that rethinking the influence of gendered orientalism on asylum law can help provide more accurate and fair decisions for female muslim asylum seekers  
 what are works  copyright law subject matter in the transition to the digital era  perspectives on the third amendment to the chinese copyright act the delineation of copyright subsistence is a focus area of the third amendment to the chinese copyright law  this paper addresses the proposed reforms to the concept of  works  in the chinese copyright act in response to the challenges of the digital era and the international complaints regarding inadequate intellectual property protection in china  the amendment proposes a new definition of  works  and introduces new types of work such as audiovisual works  computer programs and works of applied art  the paper further discusses the conundrum of the copyright protection of  illegal works  in the aftermath of the us china trips dispute  as well as the controversial topic of orphan works  the findings of this research indicate that chinese lawmakers intend to include a potentially wide range of subjects under copyright protection following the paradigm that innovation and creation flourish with strong intellectual property protection  however  this is realizable only via an appropriate copyright enforcement mechanism  which is most essential for the current copyright law reform in china  
 what can the ftc s section 6 b  pae study teach us  a practical review of the study s methodology  results  and policy recommendations on october 6  2016  the federal trade commission  ftc  released its survey of patent assertion entities  paes  and certain licensing and manufacturing firms  the study  conducted under authority of section 6 b  of the ftc act  aimed to move past the limited information that can be gleaned from litigation records an important goal given that over 90 percent of patent enforcement activity occurs outside the courtroom  by compiling and publishing nonpublic data on licensing agreements and patent acquisition practices from 2009 through 2013  the study provides new insight into how certain paes operate  the empirical approach the ftc took  however  does impose constraints on the study s reported results  and importantly  the report presents case studies that cannot be generalized  calling into question the policy recommendations that would apply to all patent infringement suits  this article summarizes the key findings reported by the ftc and explains how the study s methodology limits its conclusions and is disconnected from its policy recommendations  the study provides interesting case studies of certain pae practices  particularly in terms of litigation  in regards to licensing practices  the study s design restricts its ability to provide definitive information  but does offer some intriguing hints at different types of paes and should inspire additional empirical research  the study results  however  do not provide empirical support for the stated policy proposals  and moreover the proposals would impact more than paes  
 what happens after the right to counsel ends  using technology to assist petitioners in state post conviction petitions and federal habeas review the right to counsel ends after an individual loses his direct appeal  there are  however  several opportunities for judicial review available to a prisoner  including statutory post conviction petitions and federal habeas review  yet state prisoners often cannot pay for counsel during their collateral review  leaving most prisoners to file pro se  filing for collateral review is a substantively and procedurally complicated process and pro se petitioners have little guidance  the supreme court s jurisprudence on prisoners  access to legal research and knowledge is unclear prisoners must have meaningful access to court but prisons are not required to provide law libraries or legal assistance  although other opportunities for legal advice are available such as jailhouse attorneys  pro bono clinics  and information packets they generally fail to provide enough assistance for pro se petitioners to meaningfully seek collateral review  without legal assistance  pro se petitioners file procedurally defaulted claims  which back up state court and federal district court dockets  this comment proposes that state prison systems provide a computer program for state prisoners who lose their direct appeals  the program would provide the prisoners with detailed assistance to make their way through collateral review  petitions that are well pled will better serve the constitutional right to habeas review and will promote judicial economy  
 what happens when an acquaintance buys your data   a new privacy harm in the age of data brokers data brokers have begun to sell consumer information to individual buyers looking to track the activities of romantic interests  professional contacts  and other people of interest  the types of data available for consumer purchase seem likely to expand over the next few years  this trend invites the emergence of a new type of privacy harm   relational control  the influence that a person can exert on another in their social or professional networks using covertly acquired private information  u s  privacy laws do not protect consumers from the possibility of relational control  moreover  few scholars have proposed reforms broad enough to address this problem  this note surveys two frameworks which provide at least a starting point  and considers several other doctrinal shifts that might limit consumer vulnerability  
 what is hate speech  part 1  the myth of hate the issue of hate speech has received significant attention from legal scholars and philosophers alike  but the vast majority of this attention has been focused on presenting and critically evaluating arguments for and against hate speech bans as opposed to the prior task of conceptually analysing the term  hate speech  itself  this two part article aims to put right that imbalance  it goes beyond legal texts and judgements and beyond the legal concept hate speech in an attempt to understand the general concept hate speech  and it does so using a range of well known methods of conceptual analysis that are distinctive of analytic philosophy  one of its main aims is to explode the myth that emotions  feelings  or attitudes of hate or hatred are part of the essential nature of hate speech  it also argues that hate speech is best conceived as a family resemblances concept  one important implication is that when looking at the full range of ways of combating hate speech  including but not limited to the use of criminal law  there is every reason to embrace an understanding of hate speech as a heterogeneous collection of expressive phenomena  another is that it would be unsound to reject hate speech laws on the premise that they are effectively in the business of criminalising emotions  feelings  or attitudes of hate or hatred

 what is property law  property law scholars have been dealing with a number of key doctrinal questions concerning property law since the first time someone pointed at something and claimed   this is mine   this scholarship has included questions such as  what are property rights  what kind of things can we have property rights in  what role can property law play in shaping our society  but one question that seems to have drawn less attention than the others is  what is property law  this article places the question of what property law is into the limelight  it tackles this question in four steps   i  it asks why the question is a valid one in the first place   ii  it presents an abstract model outlining the building blocks of property law   iii  it discusses how to separate property law from other  adjacent fields of law  and  iv  it analyses the impact that developments in eu law have on the main question of what property law is  
 what role for the european parliament under article 50 teu  following the uk s vote to leave the eu in a national referendum there has been much debate over the correct legal process to be followed under both domestic law and the eu treaties to give effect to this decision  this article seeks to contribute to these discussions by focusing on an aspect of the withdrawal process which  in the author s view  has not been given full consideration to date  namely  the need for the consent of the european parliament before any withdrawal agreement may be completed  
 what sorts of things are public morals  a liberal cosmopolitan approach to article xx gatt existing theories of wto law cannot adequately explain the form or content of the gatt exceptions  in particular article xx a  public morals  nor  in consequence  can they satisfactorily answer the interpretive questions they raise  this article explains article xx in terms of self determination as a political and moral value  and the choices it mandates peoples make for themselves  drawing on debates in contemporary political philosophy  it distinguishes three categories of argument for self determination  intrinsic  expressive and instrumental  each having implications for the scope of the choices a self determining community must make for itself  this account of self determination in trade regulation is used to reconstruct article xx  both explaining the individual provisions  and suggesting how these might be developed and interpreted  it concludes by examining article xx a  in detail  highlighting the interpretive questions public morals pose  and how understanding article xx in terms of self determination suggests these should be answered  
 what s public about crime  it is often claimed that the fact that some wrongs are public is a fact that is important to our thinking about permissible criminalisation  we argue that it is not  some say  what gives us reason to criminalise wrongs when we have such a reason is the fact that those wrongs are public  others say  the fact that a wrong is public is a necessary condition of there being reason to criminalise that wrong  or of its permissible criminalisation  what we should make of these statements depends on what is meant by a public wrong  if the claim that a wrong is public is simply the conclusion of a sound argument that there is reason to criminalise the wrong  or that the wrong is permissibly criminalised  the above statements are true  but trivially so  if the claim that a wrong is public is a premise in an argument that there is reason to criminalise the wrong  or that the wrong is permissibly criminalised  the above statements  we argue  are false  we conclude that it would be better  when we think about permissible criminalisation  to do without the idea of a public wrong  
 when anti discrimination law discriminates  a right to transgender dignity in disability law the americans with disabilities act of 1990  ada  and its subsequent amendments in 2008 provided comprehensive protection against discrimination based on actual or perceived disabilities  in a compromise necessary to pass the bill  however  the drafters excluded certain disorders deemed to be morally reprehensible  including gender identity disorders  gender identity disorder  which has since been reclassified in the diagnostic and statistical manual of mental disorders as gender dysphoria  describes the distress experienced by transgender individuals as a result of the incongruence between their gender identity and their biological sex  while not all transgender individuals have gender dysphoria  gender dysphoria is exclusively associated with transgender people  unlike many of the other disorders excluded from protection under the ada  gender dysphoria neither involves criminal conduct nor causes harm to oneself or others  this note argues that the exclusion of gender dysphoria from the ada violates the dignitary rights of transgender individuals because it stigmatizes and demeans them by refusing to apply the broad  almost universal  definition of disability established by the act to gender dysphoria  the result is that transgender individuals are ineligible to seek access to anti discrimination protection that they might otherwise qualify for under the ada  this note considers the supreme court s analysis of dignity in recent gay rights jurisprudence  asserts that the supreme court recognizes dignitary rights  and argues that the ada s exclusion imposes a dignitary harm on all transgender people  this note concludes that  because the exclusion of gender identity disorder is based on animus  which the supreme court has held to lack a rational relationship to a legitimate state interest  the provision is unconstitutional  
 when batterer becomes murderer  an analysis with conditional independence we examine the causal relationship between domestic violence and the murder of a woman by her male partner using conditional independence  given a murder  we consider the independence between domestic violence and a murdering husband partner  the tria l of o j  simpson illustrates the usage of conditional independence in the courtroom  we extend good s bayesian analysis to include concepts of conditional independence and estimate related probabilities with timely data  we argue that evidence of domestic violence is relevant only where wives who suffer spousal abuse have a higher probability of being murdered by their spouses than non abused wives  
 when discussion between eyewitnesses helps memory purposepolice interviewers are typically instructed to prevent eyewitnesses from talking to each other  because witnesses can contaminate each other s memory  previous research has not fully examined  however  how discussion between witnesses affects correct and incorrect recall of witnessed events  we conducted quantitative and qualitative analyses to explore the influence of co witness discussion in more detail  methodswitnesses were interviewed individually or in pairs about a videotaped violent event  we conducted individual interviews prior to collaboration  to obtain an independent record of what individuals remembered  and after collaboration  to assess whether collaboration subsequently triggered new memories   resultspairs that were interviewed together  collaborative pairs  remembered just as much correct information overall as pairs interviewed individually  nominal pairs   but collaborative pairs made significantly fewer errors  we found evidence of retrieval disruption during the discussion  i e   collaborative pairs omitted significantly more old information during the second interview than nominal pairs  but also of a delayed cross cuing effect  i e   collaborative pairs reported significantly more new information in the final interview than nominal pairs   pairs who used more content focused retrieval strategies during the discussion  acknowledgements  repetitions  restatements  and elaborations  reported significantly more information  conclusionsthe current findings suggest that  under certain conditions  discussion between eyewitnesses can help rather than hurt memory  theoretical and practical implications will be discussed  
 who cares what you think  criminal culpability and the irrelevance of unmanifested mental states the criminal law declines to punish merely for bad attitudes that are not properly manifested in action  one might try to explain this on practical grounds  but these attempts do not justify the law s commitment to never punishing unmanifested mental states in worlds relevantly similar to ours  instead  a principled explanation is needed  a more promising explanation thus is that one cannot be criminally culpable merely for unmanifested bad attitudes  however  the leading theory of criminal culpability has trouble making good on this claim  this is the theory that an action is criminally culpable to the extent that it manifests insufficient regard for legally protected interests  the trouble is that this theory s defenders have not adequately explained what it is for an action to manifest insufficient regard  in this paper  i aim to provide the required account of manifestation  thereby rendering the insufficient regard theory more defensible  this  in turn  allows the view to explain the broad range of doctrines that treat unmanifested mental states as irrelevant  the resulting theory of criminal culpability is both descriptively plausible and normatively attractive  moreover  it highlights the continuity between criminal culpability and moral blameworthiness by showing how the former functions as a stripped down analogue of the latter  
 who holds influence over wto jurisprudence  what shapes jurisprudence in international law  states dedicate considerable effort trying to influence not only the outcome  but also the content  of legal rulings  the stakes are high  as these legal opinions can redefine the meaning of the rules  looking at the world trade organization  we ask whether some countries hold more influence over jurisprudence than others  and what such influence depends on  using text analyses of every country submission in every ruling in the wto era  we test a number of theoretical expectations  we find that some countries do appear to hold greater sway over the content of rulings than others  a country s wealth  but especially its legal experience  account for much of this variation  secondly  countries  influence over the content of the verdict varies according to how novel the legal issue being ruled on is  states have more influence over the content of the ruling  the less precedent judges have to rely on in terms of prior legal decisions  the salience of the case and judges  legal experience also follow expectations  as both are shown to take away from countries  influence  overall  the degree to which countries  submissions influence the content of rulings appears to vary systematically  legal capacity affects not only countries  ability to file disputes  but also their ability to affect the shape of the resulting jurisprudence  
 who is in private prisons  demographic profiles of prisoners and workers in american private prisons who is in private prisons  this seemingly straightforward question has received surprisingly little attention in the united states  this paper analyzes national prison data to provide demographic profiles of prisoners and workers in private prisons in the united states and to compare them to prisoners and workers in state and federal prisons  it summarizes data on jurisdiction  sentence length  race  and citizenship of prisoners  as well as the race and gender of correctional officers  results reveal differences between private and public prisons with respect to both prisoners and workers  specifically  private prisons detain inmate populations that are disproportionately non white  under federal jurisdiction  and serving short sentences  and they employ officers that are disproportionately female and black or hispanic  these results depict the private prison sector as distinct from its public counterpart both in terms of prisoner and staff composition  a discussion considers the implications of these findings for equity in punishment   c  2017 elsevier ltd  all rights reserved  
 why is the equal merit principle  almost  straightforwardly wrong  this article challenges the equal merit principle   introduced to the judicial appointment process by the crime and courts act 2013  the author argues that this principle does not take diversity seriously enough and none of its possible justifications stand up to close scrutiny  the author also claims that the doctrine that judges should be appointed solely on the basis of merit is either wrong  for the very same reasons as the equal merit principle  or rather uninformative because it fails to give sufficient guidance to those who select judges  
 why judicial control of price terms in consumer contracts might not always be the right answer   insights from behavioural law and economics regulators everywhere are confronted with the question of how to react to contractual pricing structures that serve to hide rather than reveal the real cost of goods and services and thereby abuse limitations in the cognitive competences of consumers  given that sellers service providers systematically make use of insights from behavioural sciences to refine their manipulative pricing techniques  regulators should also integrate scientific findings on human decision making to correct behavioural market failures through more tailored policy choices  a holistic approach regarding similar problems is still missing in the eu and the issue is often disguised behind a discussion on unfair terms control  which does not serve the purpose of finding a lasting solution  the aim of this article is twofold  first  to show the weaknesses of an ex post judicial control of pricing techniques  and second  to discuss policy tools which could counterbalance consumer biases on which the techniques rely  
 williams v the bermuda hospitals board  pro patient  but for ambiguities which remain williams v bermuda hospitals board concerned questions of causation arising from a hospital board s negligent delay in failing to diagnose and treat a patient expeditiously  in this case  pus from a ruptured appendix began to develop before the hospital board s negligent delay in providing proper treatment by performing surgery to remove the appendix  this delay also contributed to the accumulation of sepsis  which eventually caused injury to the patient s heart and lungs  the purpose of the appeal was to determine whether it was possible in principle to substantiate a causal link by proving that a breach of duty of care made a material contribution to the damage suffered in cases where the factors contributing to the indivisible damage operated successively  as opposed to simultaneously  the privy council decided that bonnington castings v wardlaw  the principal authority governing material contribution to damage  was not limited to cases in which the timing of the origin of the contributory causes is simultaneous  whilst this makes williams a patient oriented decision  and commendable as a matter of principle  no indication is given as to whether there will be any difference in how damages are awarded in cases with multiple defendants versus cases with single defendant  further  williams  obiter comments on bailey v ministry of defence and the relationship between the  but for  test for and the material contribution test is vague  when a more definitive conclusion could have bolstered the pro patient decision in this case  
 winning the battle but losing the war  the birth and death of intersecting notions of race and sex discrimination in white v  crook in 1965  no federal court had yet held that sex based classification was a denial of equal protection  the notion that a race sex analogy could even be made under the fourteenth amendment was highly controversial among members of the women s movement  the civil rights movement  and the legal establishment  it was not until white v  crook  a 1965 case in which the american civil liberties union   aclu   challenged the exclusion of african americans and women from alabama juries  that a federal court recognized that the statutory exclusion of women from jury service constituted discrimination under the fourteenth amendment  despite the great ambitions of pauli murray and dorothy kenyon  the architects behind the race sex analogy  white v  crook has been reduced to little more than a paragraph  if not a footnote  in most accounts of both the civil rights movement and the women s movement  the sex discrimination claim is treated as a side issue in histories told from a racial equality perspective  while the race discrimination claim is treated as a side issue in the feminist legal histories  this note seeks to provide a legal historical account of how these two claims ended up side by side for the first time in a case that arose out of the murder of a civil rights activist in 1965 in the deep south  this note explores the distance between the civil rights movement and the women s rights movement  as well as the careers of the lawyers who brought them together for a brief moment in time  notably pauli murray  because the legal and historical literature dedicated to the two movements during this time period is as bifurcated as the movements themselves  this paper seeks to weave together the stories that led each of these two movements to collaborate under the umbrella of the aclu in alabama in 1965  this close examination of white v  crook demonstrates the extent to which the dominant voices in each movement were preoccupied by their respective claims to equality under the fourteenth amendment during this moment of constitutional change  the subsequent entrenchment of arguments treating race and sex as separate and analogous phenomena  rather than overlapping and intersecting  as suggested by murray  should come as no surprise  by drawing attention to the intersectional origins of sex discrimination  this paper seeks to revive an interest in the intersectional possibilities of the equal protection clause  
 working across difference  theory  practice and experience back in october 2015 i had the opportunity to chair the book launch for all three works discussed in this review essay  at the event  shirley anne tate said   black feminist theory is the theory   the comment referred to how it is not  just  that black feminist theory is typically marginalised within institutional contexts and academic scholarship   even  within critical  feminist and poststructural work  but also to highlight the capacity of black feminist scholarship to unpick and destabilise the known and knowable in ways that are profoundly ontological  and which offer potential routes to meaningful social change through the hard task of working across difference  the three books reviewed here by shirley anne tate  suryia nayak and shona hunter are theoretically rich and complex in breadth  scope and range  drawing on extensive black feminist scholarship  as well as critical race  critical feminist  psychosocial  psychoanalytic  postcolonial  decolonial and poststructural approaches  each book is embedded in everyday practices and social processes  offering multi layered movement across different spatial social and affective scales in ways that allow  big  insights to emerge from the locatedness and particularity of human experience  they are reviewed in turn and some concluding comments identify important commonalities across the texts  
 wrong about rights  public knowledge of key areas of consumer  housing and employment law in england and wales over many decades  processes of juridification have brought about huge growth in legal rights  responsibilities and protections  yet citizens appear to poorly understand this law thick  world  this impacts citizens  capacity to name  blame and claim  in the legal domain at a time of retreat from public funding of civil legal services  this article examines public knowledge of rights in key areas relating to consumer  housing and employment law  drawing on data from the 2010 2012 english and welsh civil and social justice survey  the article uses responses to a series of hypothetical scenarios to explore public knowledge of rights and characteristics associated with knowledge  our findings highlight a substantial deficit in individuals  understanding of legal rights and responsibilities   even among those for whom particular rights and responsibilities have specific bearing  we also consider what these findings mean for public legal education and the efficiency  efficacy and legitimacy of the law  
 wrongful convictions and prototypical black features  can a face type facilitate misidentifications  purposeeyewitness misidentification is the leading cause of wrongful convictions  and black men  more than other racial groups  are affected by this memory error  a subgroup of black men who have stereotypically black features  dark skin  wide lips  and nose  are associated with the criminal black man stereotype more than their atypical counterparts  this perception of criminality leads to harsh sentencing and misidentification from line ups in laboratory studies  in this study  we investigated whether face type biases that lead to misidentifications in the laboratory extend to real world cases  methodparticipants rated the face stereotypicality of black men exonerated by the innocence project  ip  with dna evidence  who were incarcerated due to eyewitness misidentification  ip eyewitness  and for non misidentification reasons  ip other   resultshigher stereotypicality face ratings were given to ip eyewitness exonerates than to ip other exonerates regardless of participant race  moreover  the face ratings were unrelated to the race of the eyewitness in the actual case  i e   cross race  same race   suggesting that cross race misidentification was not associated with higher stereotypicality ratings of the ip eyewitness exonerates  conclusionsthese findings are consistent with extant laboratory research wherein black men with stereotypical facial features are at increased risk for eyewitness misidentification and that face type biases extend beyond cross race judgements  these results further highlight the risk of face type judgements in misidentifications that potentially contribute to error in real world cases  
 wto and soes  article xvii and related provisions of the gatt 1994 by acting as a trader  a government may influence the direction of international trade through its purchases and sales decisions without resort to other more direct means of trade regulation  the gatt recognizes that governments may choose to participate in international commerce in competition with private firms  but it does not leave them with a free hand when it comes to carrying out trading operations  the core rules regulating a state s trading activities are found in article xvii and related provisions of the gatt  in the 70 years since their adoption  developments in both the gatt 1947 and the wto have delineated a set of relatively limited disciplines rooted in the principle of non discrimination  raising doubts about their effectiveness to address the kinds of problems caused by  state trading  today  it remains true  however  that while state trading enterprises continue to operate across the world  and fundamental questions about the full reach and scope of the existing disciplines endure  opportunities to clarify their role in the modern trading system may well arise in the future practice of wto members  
 you have no right to remain silent  self incrimination in ecuador s indigenous legal systems ecuador s constitution recognizes the indigenous peoples  collective right to use and apply their own legal systems in cases of internal disputes  the constitution  however  sets as a limit the respect of human rights  this article examines one particular human right  the right to remain silent  after describing the findings of three separate field research trips to ecuador  this article concludes that indigenous legal systems  ils  seem not to provide such a right to the offender  the absence of this right could be explained by three reasons  first  ils do not use lawyers as intermediaries between the adjudicators and the offender  second  ils usually do not resort to technical evidence or expert witnesses  speech being the main tool for proving or disproving the allegations  third  ils usually seek restoration and rehabilitation rather than retribution  to achieve these goals  it is believed that offenders should confess their wrongs and ask for forgiveness  in western countries  the right to silence is based on a particular conception of individual state relations that is not necessarily present in the indigenous world  furthermore  the right to silence is counterintuitive and difficult to reconcile with lay morality  parents  teachers  or employers would not accept silence if they had well grounded suspicions that their children  students  or employees made a mistake  western societies created this right only for the sake of the accused in criminal proceedings  following a logic that deems false positives  the wrongful conviction of the innocent  much costlier than false negatives  the wrongful acquittal of a criminal   ils seem to follow a different logic  similar to the one used in the west in civil cases  where silence is not permitted   ils make no distinction between criminal and civil law  nor do they use imprisonment as punishment  silence in these types of settings is not as necessary as in those where the accused is threatened with jail time  this article suggests that the focus should not be on whether the offender was requested to speak  but rather on the tactics employed to obtain a statement  i will show that certain tactics may be regarded as persuasion  while others could safely be classified as ill treatment
