 agency costs when agents perform better than owners this paper extends jensen and meckling s agency cost theory  a clockwise rotation of their budget constraint represents better performance by agents compared to owners and higher firm values  this extension incorporates alchian and demsetz s view of the firm  wherein firm values increase when managers are employed  it is then sub optimal for owner managers to directly expropriate non pecuniary benefits through the firm as in jensen and meckling  it is instead pareto optimal that owner managers who seek to expropriate non pecuniary benefits do so using the firm s higher value  and trading it for the non pecuniary benefits they desire in the open market   c  2017 elsevier inc  all rights reserved  
 am i as extended as you say i am  consumer s emic perspectives on the extended self although the extended self construct has been widely investigated in consumer research  it has inspired relatively few critiques  moreover  there has been little research which directly assesses consumers  own emic perspectives on the extended self  here  an empirical investigation is reported which explicitly solicits consumers  own ideas and hermeneutically considers them in relation to etic researcher theory  the findings indicate a major theoretical blind spot  not only do consumers differ in the polysemy  that is  the various meanings and discourses they apply to the extended self but also that marketing theory should be revised to reflect this lack of universal understanding  
 be careless with that  availability of product upgrades increases cavalier behavior toward possessions consumers are often faced with the opportunity to purchase a new  enhanced product  such as a new phone  even though the product they currently own is still fully functional  the authors propose that consumers act more recklessly with their current products when in the presence of appealing  though not yet attained  product upgrades  not just mere replacements   carelessness and neglect toward currently owned products stem from a desire to justify the attainment of upgrades without appearing wasteful  a series of studies with actual owners of a wide range of different goods  durable  consumable  functional  and hedonic products  and evidence from a real word data set of lost apple iphones demonstrate how the availability of product upgrades increases cavalier behavior toward possessions  moreover  the authors demonstrate that product neglect in the presence of attractive upgrades can occur without deliberate intentions  finally  theoretical andmanagerial implications of these findings are discussed  
 keep open  the potential of gatekeepers for the aligning universities to the new knowledge triangle universities are increasingly seen as institutions which anticipate and address the challenges induced by interactions within the knowledge triangle  kt   the interactions between actors in the kt force individual agents to adjust and refine their models of operation and provide targeted output which supports the activities of other agents  among companies  we saw the emergence of the open innovation concept which stresses the will of companies to cooperate in innovation  at the same time  the scientific community is increasingly challenged by open access to research findings and by online learning courses  these two recent developments are among the most important that were significantly initiated by gatekeepers  themselves especially important actors within the kt because they possess the power to orchestrate and direct the linkages between kt actors  until recently  the role of gatekeepers within the kt has been little analysed  the paper suggests that understanding the role and characteristics of gatekeepers is essential for substantial and sustainable interactions between kt agents and the fulfilment of the third mission of universities  therefore  the linkages go beyond purely knowledge and technology transfer linkages but rather show how gatekeepers influence competency building for delivering information and technologies to other organizations and enhancing institutions  absorptive capacity which is argued to be crucial for implementing effective  targeted  and productive interactions of universities  it is argued that universities need to be aware of gatekeepers  competences and powers well in advance to make use of knowledge exchange with other parties to shape society  in addition  it is argued that universities  skill base as shown in researchers  competences is a vital element of universities  intellectual capital which should be included in universities  performance evaluation frameworks  finally  the paper argues that it is important for policy making in science  technology and innovation to possess knowledge of gatekeepers  position in the kt to enhance collaboration between kt agents and provide research institutions  namely universities  with the competences needed to vitalize the universities  third mission    c  2016 elsevier inc  all rights reserved  
 our brand s failure leads to  their  product derogation this research examines when and how consumers  product attitudes and their subsequent word of mouth behaviors are impacted by negative information about a brand that is associated with their social group  we find that negative information about an in group brand threatens the in group members  social identity  which in turn results in derogation of the threatening out group s product  importantly  we identify that the communication source of the negative information determines whether a threat to social identity will be realized  the out group product derogation effect is observed only when the communication of the negative information comes from an out group  vs  in group  source  finally  we provide evidence for our proposed mechanism by showing that a group affirmation exercise mitigates the out group product derogation effect we have identified   c  2017 society for consumer psychology  published by elsevier inc  all rights reserved  
 regretting your brand self  the moderating role of consumer brand identification on consumer responses to purchase regret extending the study of consumer brand relationships in the post purchase stages of consumer decision making and in situations involving unfavorable comparisons with foregone brands  this research investigates the role of consumer brand identification on consumer responses to purchase regret  drawing on regret theory and consumer brand relationship literature  the authors argue that consumer brand identification immunizes the brand from the negative consequences of purchase regret through the amplification of consumers  cognitive regret regulation and the attenuation of consumers  behavioral regret coping  an empirical study using scenario manipulation of regret for participants  favorite brands provides support to the protective role of consumer brand identification  the results indicate that consumer brand identification attenuates the negative effects of regret on satisfaction and behavioral intentions and strengthens the positive impact of satisfaction on brand repurchase recommendation intent  the findings enrich regret and consumer brand relationship theories and provide managerial insights for effective branding strategy development under conditions of intense competitive pressure  
 to promote that demand  toward a history of the marketing white paper as a genre although various types of documents are called white papers  in technical marketing communication the white paper is usually a document that describes a new or improved technology in order to generate interest inand promote sales ofthat technology  most sources discussing the history of the white paper assume that marketing white papers evolved from government white papers  they conflate genre history with etymology  at some point in the mid 20th century  the term white paperdenoting a type of government policy documentbegan being applied to other types of documents  including eventually a particular form of technical marketing communication  this article proposes a revised history of the marketing white paper as a genre  by examining the formal features and characteristic substance of white papers through the lens of their pragmatic value as social action  we show that the marketing white paper of today has much in common with documents from the 16th  17th  and 18th centuries

  brexit  and international insolvency beyond the realm of mutual trust the outcome of the referendum held in the uk in june 2016 is of far reaching and unpredictable consequences  this article focuses on the particular field of international insolvency with a view to identifying some of them  all arising out of the fact that the uk will be leaving the eu area of justice and the strong cooperation based on mutual trust between member states  this will make uk eu insolvency cases clearly less efficient and effective  the consequences of brexit could be mitigated by the already existing coordination among the international instruments dealing with these matters  in particular the european insolvency regulation and the uncitral model law on cross border insolvency  however  not all eu member states have in place rules dealing with these issues as regards to third states  in order to lessen the impact of brexit in this sensitive area of law  the implementation of the model law in order to deal with extra eu crossborder insolvency could be of avail  copyright  c  2017 insol international and john wiley   sons  ltd  
  misfits  do try to fit  deviations from firm specific optimal multinationality and subsequent market entry or exit in us law firms transaction cost and internalization theory research has demonstrated that  misfit  firms  which deviate from firm specific optimal levels of multinationality  experience performance decreases  however  we do not know if these firms subsequently adjust their multinational footprints to improve performance  this analysis attempts to fill this gap in the literature  using data in the context of large us law firms from 2003 through 2015  results indicate that firms with insufficient multinationality relative to their firm specific optimal levels are more likely to enter new foreign markets in a subsequent period  additionally  firms with excessive multinationality relative to their firm specific optimal levels are more likely to exit markets in a subsequent period  these results contribute to theory by showing that maintaining firm specific multinationality is a continuous adaptive process  results also highlight managerial benefits to continuously evaluating the efficiency of how international interdependencies are organized in response to changing environments and firm factors  
  meta  framing strategic entrepreneurship in this essay  we seek to focus scholarly discourse on the conceptual identity  boundaries  and precision of strategic entrepreneurship as an organizational construct  to give a face to a construct  lines must be drawn  marking off what it encompasses and what it does not  we  thus  first frame and assess prior conceptualizations from a construct clarity perspective  our intent here is not to exhaustively catalogue all the varied conceptualizations available  but rather to map in lieu of burrow the content domain of strategic entrepreneurship as a theoretical construct  illuminate points of convergence and divergence  and reveal potential blind spots and ambiguities in extant definitions  then  we advance a meta framework for stimulating discourse around the key construct parameters  we say meta framework because we do not seek to offer a silver bullet but rather advance a core set of questions to view strategic entrepreneurship with greater clarity and precision  we conclude with a set of suggestions for guiding and stimulating future research

 a  names and faces approach  to stakeholder identification and salience  a matter of status despite its increasing popularity across management disciplines  stakeholder theory holds an important shortcoming in terms of its guidance for understanding the heterogeneity of stakeholder interests  claims  and behavior toward firms  specifically  scholars note the inadequacy of generic categories of stakeholders  e g   customers  employees  shareholders  and suppliers  in providing a realistic portrait of the groups and individuals that interact with the firm  opening the theory to much criticism for a  simplistic  and  meaningless  stakeholder concept  in face of this challenge  recent research is pointing to social identity as a mechanism to refine our understanding of stakeholders as names and faces  however we argue that despite the advancements offered by the social identity approach  it too presents limitations in its ability to guide managers in prioritizing stakeholder claims  building on these nascent efforts to offer much needed nuance to a theory of stakeholder identification and prioritization  this paper draws from new advances in the management literature and offers status as an attribute that helps explain and predict how managers accord attention to their various constituents  we set forth five propositions connecting stakeholder status to the attention stakeholders receive from managers  we argue that status is a superior attribute of stakeholder identification and prioritization because it  1  accounts for groups and individuals  uniqueness within broad categories of stakeholders in a dynamic way   2  reconciles the dual nature of stakeholders as holding simultaneously a social and an economic identity in their claim toward the firm  and  3  provides a plausible explanation of  and intuitive guidance to  how managers accord attention to their firm s stakeholders  implications and future directions for research complete this article

 a contingency theory of entrepreneurial debt governance access to debt can be crucial for entrepreneurs who need capital  embedding economic ties within a social relationship with the debt provider can ensure capital availability and attenuate opportunism  however  such a relationship requires substantial investments in time and effort  we advance a solution to this entrepreneurial conundrum by proposing a contingency theory which prescribes aligning the fundamental transactional properties  i e   asset specificity  uncertainty and frequency  with the nature of the entrepreneur bank relationship  i e   embedded versus arm s length   our theory predicts that transactional properties affect the optimal governance of the entrepreneur bank relationship  and that social embeddedness can transform what looks like a market transaction  e g   a debt transaction  into a hybrid form of governance more akin to a hierarchy  using a sample of small businesses in the u s   we find that congruence between the optimal governance structure and the actual governance structure results in higher firm performance

 a coordination mechanism for optimizing the contingent free shipping threshold in online retailing shipping policy is critical for online retailing from a marketing and economics perspective  to design the most suitable contingent free shipping  cfs  policy  this paper proposes a coordination mechanism between an online retailer and a delivery operator in a decentralized supply chain  since the cfs policy affects not only the amount of consumer orders but also the real order value  we first analysed the consumers  purchasing decision based on the consumer utility theory  next  we applied a stackelberg model to simulate how the delivery operator decides the price of the delivery service and the retailer sets the cfs threshold in succession  compared to the centralized case  the optimal cfs threshold is higher in the decentralized case without coordination  the expected profit of the whole supply chain decreases by 25   we further propose a mechanism that uses modified quantity discount contracts to coordinate the supply chain  the results show that our qd contract design may aid in coordinating the supply chain and compel the retailer to choose the system wide optimal threshold value  finally  we present a numerical example to illustrate the findings of the models and provide suggestions for applying quantity discount contracts   c  2017 elsevier b v  all rights reserved  
 a curvilinear relationship between entrepreneurial orientation and firm performance  the moderating role of employees  psychological safety while many studies on the relationship between entrepreneurial orientation  eo  and firm performance suggested a considerable variation in size and direction of the relationship  our study tested a model that considered the drawbacks of a high eo  we identified that eo has a curvilinear relationship with firm performance and analyzed how the psychological safety of employees can mitigate the negative effects of high eo on firm performance  we tested our model on 157 enterprises comprising 1633 employees and 157 managers  after taking a longitudinal approach with objective financial outcome data  our results showed that eo has an inverted u shaped effect in predicting firm performance and that employees  psychological safety moderates the relationship between eo and firm performance  mitigating the negative effects  this study has theoretical implications related to the potential negative impact of excessive eo and practical implications for companies in mitigating this drawback by increasing employees  psychological safety  
 a fair game  racial bias and repeated interaction between nba coaches and players there is strong evidence of racial bias in organizations but little understanding of how it changes with repeated interaction  this study proposes that repeated interaction has the potential to reduce racial bias  but its moderating effects may be limited to the treatment of individuals rather than of entire racial groups  using data from 2 360 national basketball association  nba  players and 163 coaches from 1955 to 2000  i find that players receive more playing time under coaches of the same race  even though there is no difference in their performance  this racial bias is greatly reduced  however  as the player and the coach spend more time on the same team  suggesting that repeated interaction minimizes coaches  biases toward their players  but it does not reduce coaches  racial biases in general  even after years of coaching other race players  coaches still exhibit the same levels of racial bias as they did upon first entering the league  these results suggest that repeated workplace interaction is effective in reducing racial bias toward individuals but not toward groups  making an important contribution to the literature on organizational inequality

 a new integrated methodology using modified delphi fuzzy ahp promethee for geospatial business intelligence selection geospatial business intelligence  geospatial bi  is a system that combines multidimensional analysis and cartographic visualization  it plays an important role in decision making process for enterprises  adopting such a comprehensive solution may result in the great investment decision for them  so great deal of attention should be given in the selection of the optimal system  as there are many impacting factors in the selection of geospatial bi system  the same process is considered as a complex multi criteria decision making problem  in this paper  we explore the application of an integrated methodology for the evaluation of various geospatial bi alternatives  the proposed methodology integrates the three well known decision making techniques  namely modified delphi  fuzzy analytic hierarchical process  fuzzy ahp   and preference ranking organization method for enrichment evaluations  promethee   in this respect  the modified delphi is used to select the most impacting factors by a few decision makers  the fuzzy ahp is employed to analyze the structure of the problem and to obtain the weights of the qualitative and quantitative criteria  by incorporating the uncertainty values  then  the promethee technique is used for optimal ranking of the alternative system choices  a step by step  numerical study is illustrated by using the proposed methodology on the decision making problem of a company that is faced to five geospatial bi solutions  the results demonstrate that the proposed methodology can successfully accomplish our goal of this study  
 a new method to decompose profit efficiency  an application to us commercial banks we propose a new method to estimate profit efficiency which makes explicit how revenue and cost efficiencies contribute to overall profit efficiency  using data from us commercial banks from 2001 to 2010  we find that losses due to profit inefficiency represent about 3 5  of banks  equity of which 1  is due to revenue inefficiency and 2 4  to cost inefficiency  revenue efficiency changes affect more overall profit efficiency than equivalent cost efficiency changes  in contrast to previous studies  but in line with economic intuition  we find that while revenue and cost efficiencies tend to be negatively correlated  both correlate positively with profit efficiency

 a note on modeling world equity markets with nonsynchronous data we investigate information transmission in world equity markets using lengthy time series of daily data for nine developed equity markets over the 1999 2014  post euro  time interval  three nine variable systems are examined  including stock indexes in both local currency and us dollars plus foreign exchange rates  after finding only weak evidence of cointegration in the three nine variable systems  vector autoregression models are used to identify which price indexes drive the others  our initial tests are consistent with earlier findings  that is  the us market appears to be the clear price leader  however  after constructing alternative models with the us data series lagged one period  making it the first market reported each day rather than the last   the results are reversed  the us is no longer the price leader  the us market is driven by nearly all other markets  while making little or no impact on the others  thus  in earlier studies using nonsynchronous data reported by calendar date  it only appears that the us drives other stock markets  when in fact the us is merely an equal participant in information transmission around the world   c  2017 elsevier b v  all rights reserved  
 a novel approach for predicting and understanding consumers  sense of design similarity product designers continuously emphasize how important yet difficult it is to create new products with designs similar enough for brand recognition  yet dissimilar enough for a unique positioning  advancing the understanding of perceived design similarity would greatly help to systematically manage this balance  design literature typically assesses how much a new design deviates from the status quo based on consumers  holistic similarity perceptions  for management practice  however  tests of numerous design alternatives with consumers throughout the npd process are time consuming  costly  and threaten confidentiality  in addition  simple surveys often do not suffice to understand the role of individual design characteristics in the holistic perception of a product design  this article introduces an objective measurement approach of design similarity to overcome these drawbacks  the results of an empirical study demonstrate that consumers  perception of design similarity can be reproduced by means of this approach  in addition  this approach makes measurement of design similarity more efficient  uncovers the design characteristics that drive holistic similarity perceptions  and enables managers to predict the positioning of alternative product designs in the perceptual space minimizing the need for consumer surveys

 a review of research on outward foreign direct investment from emerging countries  including china  what do we know  how do we know and where should we be heading  using the antecedents  decisions and outcomes  ado  format as an organizing framework  this article gives an overview of the literature on different dimensions and characteristics of outward foreign direct investment  ofdi  by firms from emerging countries  based on an extensive coverage of studies published over a period of nearly 25years between 1993 and 2017  we review extant research on this phenomenon from mainly china  as well as other emerging countries  we identify advances and analytical areas of ofdi research and pinpoint the key theories  methodologies  observed characteristics and the variables that have been examined in this growing research literature  many areas of the above research themes remain underexplored  despite recent significant advancements  and may provide directions for future research  
 a review of the internal capital allocation literature  piecing together the capital allocation puzzle allocating internal financial capital represents a key task for managers of multidivisional corporations  this has led to a wealth of research and theorizing about capital allocation and whether or not managers allocate capital successfully  however  capital allocation research has diverged in a number of directions that reflect different and often incompatible perspectives  underlying frameworks  and outcomes  the result is a puzzle  wherein scholars have found little consistent substantive relation between capital allocation  business unit characteristics  and firm performance  through our review  we seek to bring clarity to this puzzle by identifying problems in the literature and by offering a solution  we suggest problems in the literature stem from the disparate approaches scholars have taken when studying capital allocation  including assessments of what constitutes and prevents successful allocation  we begin by organizing these approaches into a framework that highlights key allocation strategies and the primary impediments to allocation success that scholars have used to build their models  we then suggest that managers may employ a number of allocation strategies and that scholars need to recognize that not all corporate managers employ the same strategy  we contend that a resurgence of obtrusive  qualitative  and multilevel studies may help explain why managers select one strategy over another  ultimately  we recommend scholars delve into the black box of organizations to truly understand capital allocation  
 a satisficing approach to eliciting risk preferences a new approach is proposed to eliciting risk preferences by framing choice over risky payoff distributions as a satisficing task  we demonstrate novel links between the information elicited from the satisficing task which allows subjects to consider accepting a worse worst case outcome in favor of a better best case outcome and portfolio choice using expected utility theory  eut   the key tradeoff in our satisficing task can also be stated in reverse  to consider accepting less attractive potential upside gains in order to improve worst case outcomes  risk preferences are elicited by asking subjects to choose an acceptable worst case portfolio outcome from a continuum of binary gambles  each with its own support and unique minimum  the worst case aspiration represents the smallest low state payoff in the binary gamble that the subject is willing to accept  we show analytically and empirically that choosing a most preferred worst case aspiration maps into a logically equivalent but psychologically distinct process of expected utility maximization  i e   allocating one s savings over a binary risky asset and risk free bond using the eut framework with a unique risk acceptance parameter under cara or crra risk preferences   
 a simple skewed distribution with asset pricing applications  recent research has identified skewness and downside risk as one of the most important features of risk  we present a new distribution which makes modeling skewed risks no more difficult than normally distributed  symmetric  risks  our distribution is a combination of the  downside  and  upside  half of two normal distributions  and its parameters can be calculated in closed form to match a given mean  variance  and skewness  value at risk  expected shortfall  portfolio weights  and risk premia have simple expressions for our distribution and show economically meaningful deviations from the normal case already for very modest levels of skewness  an empirical application suggests that our distribution fits the data well  
 a superlative index number formula for the hicks moorsteen productivity index the malmquist and hicks moorsteen productivity indexes are the two most widely used theoretical indexes for measuring productivity growth  since these productivity indexes are defined by unknown distance functions  it is necessary to estimate the distance functions to compute them in principle  on the other hand  the tornqvist productivity index is an empirical index number formula that is directly computable from the prices and quantities of the inputs and outputs alone  caves et al   1982  imply that the malmquist index coincides with the tornqvist index under profit maximizing behaviour and constant returns to scale technology  the purpose of the present paper is to point out that the hicks moorsteen productivity index coincides with the tornqvist productivity index under the same condition  we emphasize that the condition of constant returns to scale is indispensable for deriving the equivalence between the two indexes  moreover  even when this condition is relaxed to the alpha returns to scale  the equivalence between the hicks moorsteen and tornqvist productivity indexes is shown to hold true  
 a systems perspective on business model evolution  the case of an agricultural information service provider in india this paper explores how the organizational capabilities of a firm enable business model evolution by examining the development of a new firm that provides mobile phone based information services for farmers in india  we argue that these organizational capabilities are part of the dynamic capabilities of the firm  we use a longitudinal and in depth single case study to extend our understanding of the mechanism for business model evolution in new firms  the study shows three themes emerging from the data analysis of the case study by drawing on the literatures on systems thinking  dynamic capabilities and business model evolution  the three themes are balanced redundancy  requisite variety and cognitive discretion  which enable a firm to achieve congruence between the components of the business model in order to deliver the customer value proposition  we explain how these three micro foundations of dynamic capabilities enable a firm to evolve its business model  we contribute to the business model and dynamic capabilities literature by proposing a systems perspective on business models and their evolution   c  2016 elsevier ltd  all rights reserved

 a technology based countries interaction dynamic model for the study of european growth and stability  were there the conditions for convergence  in this research  we study a methodology for evaluating the dynamics of the european countries  growth  our focus is on the analysis of the convergence conditions implied by the lisbon strategy and founded on the interaction among technology diffusion  services for firms and production  the so called  knowledge based sustainable growth    we estimate and analyse a differential equations system representing a disequilibrium model where business services assist the production process for the use of technology  to this aim  we develop a specific panel data estimation procedure for continuous time nonlinear models  we find the offshoring activity  operated by foreign business services  essential for the countries  convergence to a stable growth path  then  we perform a sensitivity analysis to assess the possible country s specific efforts necessary to gain stability  further  we provide an evaluation of the convolution integral of our differential system to determine the initial conditions required to pursue a future target value for the endogenous variables  
 a theory of risk disclosure in this paper  we consider the price effects of risk disclosure  we develop a model in which investors are uncertain about the variance of a firm s cash flows and the firm releases an imperfect signal regarding this variance  in our model  uncertainty over the riskiness of a firm s cash flows leads to a variance uncertainty premium in its price  we demonstrate that risk disclosure decreases the firm s cost of capital by reducing this premium and that the market response to risk disclosure is small when the expected level of risk is high  moreover  we find that firms acquire and disclose more risk information when their cash flow risk is greater than expected  finally  we demonstrate that in a multi asset setting  only risk disclosure concerning systematic risks will impact the cost of capital  
 a unified approach for the pricing of options relating to averages in this paper  we consider generalized asian options and propose a unified approximation method for the pricing of such options when the underlying process is a diffusion  through numerical examples  we show that our approximation method is accurate enough to be used in practice for the pricing of any type of asian options that has been treated separately in the literature  comparisons are made with the existing methods in the literature to support the usefulness of our method  
 absorptive capacity  technology spillovers  and the cross section of stock returns in the presence of potential technology spillovers  i demonstrate that a firm s absorptive capacity  ac   as proxied by r d investments  is crucial to benefit from spillovers  i find that higher ac firms  when exposed to large potential spillovers  exhibit stronger future real outcomes  cite weighted patents and operating performance  and market value  importantly  however  this value relevant information does not appear to be immediately incorporated into stock prices  leading to high future abnormal stock returns for firms with high ac and spillover exposure  furthermore  the undervaluation is most pronounced among low investor attention stocks  suggesting that limited attention contributes to the undervaluation   c  2017 elsevier b v  all rights reserved  
 academic engagement as knowledge co production and implications for impact  evidence from knowledge transfer partnerships researchers have argued that management academics  engagement with non academic stakeholders involves knowledge co production rather than simple knowledge transfer from the former to the latter  this study suggests that the conceptual lens of knowledge co production not only more fittingly describes academic engagement but also enables a clearer understanding of how academic engagement produces impact beyond academia  building upon qualitative evidence on collaborations between management academics and businesses in the united kingdom  the study supports the characterisation of academic engagement as knowledge co production and argues that its impact  i  strongly depends on sustained knowledge co producing interactions   ii   ripples out  serendipitously  indirectly benefiting many stakeholders in ways that often cannot be anticipated  and  iii  unfolds and persists over a long period  these findings have implications for impact assessment and the development of the impact research agenda  
 academic knowledge quality differentials and the quality of firm innovation this article examines whether knowledge from academic research of varying quality can lead to differential quality innovation at the firm level via a knowledge spillover process without the firm conducting the research and producing the knowledge but by using it as an external input to its innovation process  based on econometric analysis of data reflecting patent activity of emerging entrepreneurial life sciences firms and thousands of academic publications  we find that higher quality academic science associates with higher quality industrial innovation  importantly  we document that the degree that a given firm conducts basic science moderates this relationship  our work develops a novel theoretical and empirical link between academic knowledge quality and industrial innovation and identifies the contingencies that allow this link to materialize  
 accounting and sustainable development  reflections and propositions this paper emerges from an invitation to reflect upon the achievements of social and environmental accounting as well as to identify the challenges that lie ahead as the field continues its engagement with the goal of sustainable development  three perspectives are developed in pursuit of that aim  namely  exploring the nature of the issues and mode of academic inquiry that is  fit for purpose  given the demands of sustainable development  considering if a de centring of accounting and the embrace of more holistic versions of accountability would be productive for future scholarship  and an exploration of how we might conceptualise  engagement  with practice in this context  and what is meant by practice and practitioner   taken together  this paper seeks to provide points of provocation and encouragement to social and environmental accountants  critical accounting scholars and to those seeking to understand sustainable development scholarship and action   c  2017 elsevier ltd  all rights reserved  
 accounting in the london stock exchange s extractive industry  the effect of policy diversity on the value relevance of exploration related disclosures the accounting treatment of exploration expenditure in the extractive industry has historically been a challenging issue for regulators  this paper examines the accounting policies for  and value relevance of  the exploration assets of firms listed on the london stock exchange from the oil   gas and mining sectors  the policies used by oil   gas firms range from the relatively conservative successful efforts to the most aggressive full cost method  whereas mining firms employ a range of policies from the successful efforts to the most conservative expense all method  the results suggest that the income statements of main market listed extractive firms contain value relevant information regardless of the policy followed by the firm  there is no significant difference between the value relevance of exploration asset disclosures by main market listed oil   gas firms following the successful efforts or full cost methods  for aim listed oil   gas companies only the full cost method provides value relevant information on exploration assets  in the mining sector  exploration related asset disclosures are only value relevant for aim listed firms following the expense all method  the results suggest that flexibility in accounting for exploration expenditure is necessary to facilitate the disclosure of value relevant accounting information   c  2017 elsevier ltd  all rights reserved  
 acquiring growth i develop a model of mergers in which m a deals are used to reallocate investment opportunities  in equilibrium  acquirers lack internal growth options and seek out projects from targets in the m a market  the model is able to reconcile many features of the merger data that i document  including the high productivity  investment  and valuation of target firms  furthermore  in my model  profitability is highly predictive of acquisition  and merger transactions naturally lead to a substantial drop in profitability despite creating value for the acquirer   c  2017 elsevier b v  all rights reserved  
 acquisition motives and the distribution of acquisition performance research summary  i examine how acquisition motives relate to the distribution of post acquisition performance  i argue that acquisitions motivated by operating synergies have the potential to experience greater gains than acquisitions driven by financial synergies but are harder to value and implement  making them more uncertain  using sec filings  conference calls and press releases to capture acquisition motives  i find that acquirers pursuing operating synergies are more likely to experience highly positive and highly negative long term returns than acquirers pursuing financial synergies  i also find that acquisition experience and geographic proximity to targets soften acquirers  extreme downside outcomes in operating synergy acquisitions  my theory and results suggest that approaches that emphasize average outcomes for acquirers and use industry classifications to capture acquisition motives may be incomplete managerial summary  managers engage in acquisitions for various reasons  in this study  i find that reasons related to operating synergies  e g   revenue growth through new product offerings or cost savings through economies of scale  are more likely to result in extreme high and low performance outcomes for the acquiring firm compared to reasons related to financial synergies  e g   diversification of cash flow streams   in addition  i find that the acquirer s prior acquisition experience and the geographic proximity between the target and acquirer help soften the extreme low performance outcomes related to operating synergies  copyright  c  2017 john wiley   sons  ltd  
 actionable marketing knowledge  a close reading of representation  knowledge and action in market research this paper conceptualizes the notion of actionable marketing knowledge by investigating how market researchers produce and justify actionable recommendations for their clients  we build upon the market practices approach  as well as a close reading of market research reports  to conceptualize the rhetorical strategies used to guide firms into action  the findings show three rhetorical strategies  first  framing managerial anomalies draws managerial attention to perplexing situations  second  loading instruments with meaning develops a narrative in which charts and tables  speak for themselves   third  signposting prescriptions reduces interpretive flexibility by encoding guidelines within the text intended to lead readers to an intended interpretation  the relevance for business marketing is that by studying the ways representations are encoded in business reports  business scholars can better understand knowledge calibration in the theory praxis gap  
 active labor market programs  effects on entrepreneurship and unemployment many countries are turning to active labor market programs  almp  to increase individuals  incentive to start a business and to reduce unemployment  but research on the effectiveness of such programs has produced mixed results and is still inconclusive at the macroeconomic level  this article examines the importance of almp targeted at entrepreneurship to explain cross country differences in aggregate entrepreneurship rate  by using gem data over the period 2002 2013 on oecd countries  our results show a positive impact of almp on the rate of necessity entrepreneurship but no significant effect on the rate of opportunity entrepreneurship  we further established that generous unemployment benefits reduce the positive outcome of almp on the aggregate rate of necessity entrepreneurship  moreover  because most businesses started out of necessity do not create new jobs  we find that the economic spin off of such programs in terms of unemployment reduction is very limited  
 activism mergers shareholder value creation from hedge fund activism occurs primarily by influencing takeover outcomes for targeted firms  controlling for selection decisions  activist interventions substantially increase the probability of a takeover offer  third party bids for targets have higher returns  premia  and completion rates  but these patterns reverse when the activist is the bidder  failed bids for activism targets lead to improvements in operating performance  financial policy  and positive long term abnormal returns  suggesting that activism enhances value  the positive long term performance from hedge fund activism arises from monitoring target management during merger and acquisition contests and not from target undervaluation or bidder overpayment   c  2017 elsevier b v  all rights reserved  
 activity of older tourists  understanding their participation in social tourism programs a global demographic shift is leading to an increasing number of older citizens  particularly in the most developed regions  and social tourism is becoming growingly relevant throughout europe  especially in spain  where it has been successfully developed by the institute for elderly and social services  imserso  programs  the aim of this study is to create a profile of older tourists according to the types of trips they make  it uses a multinomial logistic regression to rate older citizens according to their motivation  travel  and sociodemographic characteristics  results show that older tourists prefer organized trips regardless of whether they travel on imserso trips or any other type of package tour  
 activity overinvestment  the case of r d the literature on corporate diversification has argued for and established the case that companies overdiversify in a product market sense  i e   enter into unrelated product markets where they may not fully cover their cost of capital   yet even without engaging in unrelated diversification  managers need to make resource allocation decisions in a variety of activities that a company conducts to consummate its business  in this article  we focus on r d activity  and we discuss the effects that the uncertainty  boundary ambiguity  feedback latency  r d lumpiness  and legitimacy that characterize technological contexts can have in making overinvestment in r d likely  specifically  in this article we  a  draw attention to the construct of activity overinvestment  and specifically r d overinvestment   b  use the received literature to argue that there exists a prima facie case for examining this construct and its antecedents in order to evaluate the extent and implications of r d overinvestment  and  c  make the more general case that the resource allocation literature needs to study the issue of activity overinvestment systematically  
 adaptive conjoint analysis  a new approach to defining corporate governance manuscript typeempirical research question issuethe method introduced to the corporate governance literature by this paper captures the construct of corporate governance in a small number of attributes  using responses made by directors and shareholders to an adaptive conjoint analysis questionnaire  research findings insightswe demonstrate how to identify the key attributes of corporate governance from directors  and shareholders  relative preferences among a set of corporate governance attributes  the dominance of ceo duality as a relatively more important attribute is a key finding  theoretical academic implicationsadaptive conjoint analysis is a useful technique for research into governance issues characterized by constrained choice  for future researchers seeking to capture governance in a limited number of measures  we have identified four attributes considered by directors and shareholders to comprise effective corporate governance  with the single measure of ceo duality being the most important  practitioner policy implicationsthis parsimonious set of attributes can guide the design of future corporate governance regulations  to avoid costly over regulation  we do not suggest that restrictions on multiple directorships or an appropriate board size should be added to current requirements  and the surprisingly low perceptions of audit partner tenure and audit committee size as important to good corporate governance suggest that these attributes could be excluded from future regulations

 adhd  impulsivity and entrepreneurship recently  entrepreneurship scholars have started to show interest in how  negative  traits associated with mental disorders such as adhd may have positive implications in entrepreneurship  while this research has the potential of producing important and counter intuitive results  it is still in its infancy and the causal mechanisms that drive those individuals to be attracted to entrepreneurship have received limited attention  consequently  we draw on the person environment fit literature and propose that individuals are attracted to  and engage in  entrepreneurship because the task environment of entrepreneurship which favors speed of action is aligned with the traits of those individuals  we develop and test a model which suggests that adhd influences entrepreneurship through the multifaceted trait of impulsivity  we find that inattention is negatively but hyperactivity is positively associated with entrepreneurship  we also find that sensation seeking and lack of premeditation generally positively influences entrepreneurship  whereas urgency has the opposite influence  taken together  this suggests complex  multifaceted implications of adhd and impulsivity in entrepreneurship  theoretical implications of these findings are discussed  research on entrepreneur personality has been mostly associated with positive traits  such as self efficacy and achievement motivation  however  most traits are not universally positive or negative and what is functional or dysfunctional depends on context  judge et al   2009   entrepreneurship is characterized by uncertainty  which indices anxiety  worry  procrastination and inaction among most people  mcmullen and shepherd  2006  paulus  2007   however  it is also a vocation that grants more autonomy in terms of job design and task allocation  which may be attractive to individuals who need more leeway in designing their own tasks  acknowledging the high uncertainty and autonomy in entrepreneurship  we argue that adhd symptoms  which are associated with negative consequences in many areas of life  may have positive implications in the context of entrepreneurship because adhd is characterized by traits such as sensation seeking  a focus on action with little premeditation  and a desire for autonomy  we employ person environment fit theory  e g   holland  1997  to argue that adhd symptoms influence entrepreneurial preferences and behavior through the multi dimensional traits of impulsivity  specifically  adhd symptoms are related to higher levels of sensation seeking  lack of premeditation  lack of perseverance and urgency  these traits in turn influence the perceived attractiveness of entrepreneurship and the probability of starting a business  we conducted surveys on a sample of mba alumni from a school that is consistently ranked as one of the top fifty public mba programs  who by virtue of their degree tend to have viable job opportunities and were thus less likely to be pushed into entrepreneurship  we find that adhd symptoms have a complicated relationship with entrepreneurial preferences and action  with the pathway through sensation seeking and lack of premeditation being mostly positive while the pathway through urgency being negative  further  hyperactive symptoms seem to mainly result in positive outcomes while inattention symptoms lead to negative ones  our findings demonstrate that entrepreneurship is indeed a unique area where negative traits  such as adhd  may represent valuable assets  previous research has mostly associated adhd with negative job related outcomes  barkley et al   2006   our research indicates that certain aspects of adhd symptoms  such as sensation seeking and lack of premeditation  could lead individuals to be attracted to entrepreneurship and to start their own businesses  this suggests a contextualized view of personality traits  as well as boundary conditions to existing theories  second  we develop and empirically test a model that links adhd symptoms to entrepreneurship through the multi dimensional traits of impulsivity  which provides a more nuanced and theoretically interesting understanding of the adhd entrepreneurship relationship  the same can be said about our findings of the differential influences of inattention and hyperactivity symptoms  thus  this paper contributes to previous research on adhd and entrepreneurship that has mostly examined the bivariate relationship between the two  e g   veryheul et al   2015  thurik et al   2016   finally  our post hoc analyses showed that the effects of adhd symptoms on entrepreneurship are more pronounced under highly uncertain environments  this is consistent with our theorizing  suggesting that individuals with adhd symptoms are more likely to harness advantages associated with adhd rather than suffer from associated disadvantages in highly uncertain and dynamic environments such as entrepreneurship  there are at least two important practice implications of our results  first  our results imply that individuals with adhd symptoms may be empowered to craft their own jobs to fit their special needs  second  our findings suggest that people with adhd symptoms and impulsivity will tend to prefer action speed over action accuracy and that this may be functional in the context of entrepreneurship   c  2017 elsevier inc  all rights reserved  
 affinely adjustable robust model for multiperiod production planning under uncertainty demand forecasting is an important factor in production planning  but future demand is not easy to forecast in practice  we consider a multiperiod  multiproduct production planning problem under demand uncertainty with constrains for raw materials  manufacturing capacity  and inventory  under the assumption that probability distribution of demand is not available  two types of robust optimization models are proposed  first  a robust counterpart is developed to determine the here and now decision  next  an affinely adjustable robust counterpart is developed to determine the wait and see decisions by approximating a robust solution with a linear decision rule  the robust models find an optimal solution that is always feasible and less sensitive against all realized demand within a given uncertainty set  in order to minimize production  procurement  inventory  and lost sales costs even in the worst case  numerical studies demonstrated that  without knowing probability distribution of future demand  the affinely adjustable robust counterpart approach could outperform the robust counterpart and deterministic model in terms of the average cost  the standard deviation of the realized cost  and the worst case scenario cost  the proposed method is much better than the others  especially when penalty cost due to lost sales is high and unknown demand is left skewed  
 age pensioner decumulation  responses to incentives  uncertainty and family need effective design and regulation of retirement benefits require accurate understanding of how the elderly decumulate  we analyse the income  assets and decumulation patterns of a longitudinal panel of 10 000 australian age pensioners  on average  age pensioners preserve financial and residential wealth and leave substantial bequests  there is  however  considerable heterogeneity in decumulation patterns  younger households generally run down financial wealth  while older households maintain their assets or save  means testing accelerates decumulation  with average drawdown rates 3  higher for pensioners subject to the income test relative to full pensioners and 9  higher for those subject to the asset test relative to full pensioners  loss of a partner is linked to large falls in assets  the theoretical  empirical  and practical implications of these findings are discussed

 aligning domestic policies with international coordination in a post paris global climate regime  a case for china the paris cop 21 reached a climate agreement on 2 degree global emissions stabilisation target  however  the likelihood of successfully implementing a legally binding global climate treaty will depend to a large degree on the macroeconomic impacts of different policy options on developing and emerging economies  it is thus crucial to evaluate the transition costs of implementing different climate policy architectures under socioeconomic and technological uncertainties from a multiregional perspective  here we use a hybrid computable general equilibrium model  in which sub optimalities  infrastructural inertia and technological uncertainties are explicitly introduced  to quantify the trajectories of variation in transitions costs under a range of climate policy scenarios in both annex i and developing nations  the policy architectures are based around the implementation of the  streamlined paris pledges   spp  in developing countries with a particular focus on china and india  our results indicate that the distributional effects should be taken into account by policymakers through extension of spp to 2050 as global climate policies may have asymmetrical economic impacts between annex i and developing countries  a first best policy of global cap and trade scheme alone could be welfare deteriorating for some parties  reflected by a significant reduction in macroeconomic growth rate over the course of the next decades  modelling results also suggest that articulating both global and national policies in a multiregional climate deal can provide a palatable solution for countries like china as this would allow for significant reduction in the economic losses associated with a unique carbon price global climate policy  this hybrid approach is also aligned with specific development priorities in developing and emerging countries by providing flexibility to their domestic policy framework  which expects to facilitate the transition to low carbon growth trajectory by encouraging intersectoral coordination  last  procrastination of technical change and delayed structural reform for decarbonising economy would entail significantly higher transition costs for developing countries in case of stringent climate policy due to the economic competitiveness forgone as a result of exorbitant carbon prices in the longer term  relevant policy options and research perspectives are discussed accordingly  
 aligning university industry interactions  the role of boundary spanning in intellectual capital transfer in the uk  the boundary spanning role has taken on greater significance as successive governments emphasize how universities should play in direct knowledge transfer and changing academics  visions over third mission functions  studies in the uk have focused on the relative performance of technology transfer organizations  ttos  knowledge transfer organizations  ktos  or their use by academics and external organizations  compared to their us and international counterparts  ttos ktos at uk universities exhibit low levels of absolute efficiency  therefore questions remain relating to how to raise the efficiency and productivity of these units  how to attract and train staff with suitable qualifications capabilities and how to change adverse attitudes towards knowledge exchange by some academics  currently  there is a lack of a holistic view of these functions and the way they complement each other or coordinate their activities  this study addresses this gap in theory and practise and advances how universities should provide consistency in both the internal and the external interfaces  by the offer of a framework and key stakeholder insights   c  2016 elsevier inc  all rights reserved  
 alliance concentration in multinational companies  examining alliance portfolios  firm structure  and firm performance research summary  this article explores the distribution of alliances across firms  internal structure  focusing on multinational companies  we examine the impact of alliance portfolio concentrationi e   the extent to which alliances are concentrated within a limited number of geographic unitson focal firms  performance  relying on knowledge based view  kbv  insights  we hypothesize that an increase in alliance portfolio concentration positively influences firm performance and that alliance portfolio size negatively moderates this relationship  our empirical results enrich the emerging capability perspective on alliance portfolios  point to the relevance of conceptualizing focal firms in alliance portfolio research as polylithic entities instead of monolithic ones  and provide new insights into how firms create value by potentially recombining externally accessed knowledge  managerial summary  in the setting of multinational companies  we examine whether alliance activities are concentrated in a limited number of subsidiaries or are highly dispersed across multiple subsidiaries  we find that  over time  firms exhibit different patterns in terms of alliance portfolio concentration  in addition  the results show that  for mncs with a relatively small alliance portfolio  an increase in alliance portfolio concentration is positively related to their financial performance  however  when mncs  alliance portfolios are relatively large  the relationship between alliance portfolio concentration and firm performance becomes negative  jointly  these findings suggest that the distribution of alliances across firms  internal structure is an important factor in shaping potential knowledge recombination benefits from alliance portfolios  copyright  c  2017 john wiley   sons  ltd  
 alliance or acquisition  a mechanisms based  policy capturing analysis research summary  while alliance researchers view prior partner specific alliance experience as influencing firms  subsequent alliance or acquisition decisions  empirical evidence on the alliance versus acquisition decision is surprisingly mixed  we offer a reconciliation by proposing and testing an analytical framework that recognizes prior partner specific experiences as heterogeneous along three fundamental dimensions  partner specific trust  routines  and value certainty  this allows us to use a policy capturing methodology to rigorously operationalize and test our mechanism level predictions  we find that all three mechanisms can increase the likelihood of a subsequent alliance or acquisition  and in terms of the comparative choice between alliances versus acquisitions  partner specific trust pulls towards alliances  and value certainty pulls towards acquisitions  we conclude with a discussion of the theoretical and empirical implications of our approach and method managerial summary  this study focuses on an important corporate decision  when a firm has had an alliance with another firm  how would that experience affect the likelihood of a future alliance or acquisition with that same firm  we first suggest that it will depend on three factors  the level of trust that existed in that prior alliance  the extent to which specific work routines were developed  and the degree to which the firm was able to confidently assess the value of the partner firm s resources  we then find that trust is a particularly strong predictor of future alliances  while confidence regarding value more strongly predicts future acquisitions  in this way  we demonstrate more precisely how past corporate choices can affect  consciously or unconsciously  future ones  copyright  c  2017 john wiley   sons  ltd

 an empirical analysis of algorithmic trading around earnings announcements this study examines the impact of corporate earnings announcements on trading activity and speed of price adjustment  analyzing algorithmic and non algorithmic trades during the immediate period pre  and post corporate earnings announcements  we confirm that algorithms react faster and more correctly to announcements than non algorithmic traders  during the initial surge in trading activity in the first 90 s after the announcement  algorithms time their trades better than non algorithmic traders  hence algorithms tend to be profitable  while non algorithmic traders make losing trades over the same time period  during the pre announcement period  non algorithmic volume imbalance leads algorithmic volume imbalance  however  in the post announcement period  the direction of the lead lag association is exactly reversed  our results suggest that as algorithms are the fastest traders  their trading accelerates the information incorporation process   c  2016 elsevier b v  all rights reserved  
 an empirical investigation of the effects of firm characteristics on the propensity to adopt cloud computing cloud computing  cc  is emerging as a new paradigm of resource acquisition and management of information and communication technologies  ict  by firms  which can offer significant benefits  but at the same time can pose significant risks as well  so its adoption by firms has been lower than the initial expectations  therefore  it is quite important to gain a better understanding of the factors affecting positively or negatively the adoption of cc  this paper presents an empirical investigation of the effects on a firm s propensity to adopt cc of a set of firm characteristics referring to technological infrastructure  strategy  personnel skills  size and competition  its conceptual foundation is the technology  organization and environment theory of technological innovation adoption  our study is based on data from 676 european manufacturing firms from the glass  ceramics and cement sectors  which have been collected through the e business survey of the european commission  the results indicate that in the above sectors ict infrastructure sophistication has the strongest positive effect on cc adoption propensity among all examined firm characteristics  furthermore  we have found that the existence of an ict investment reduction strategy  the employment of specialized ict personnel and the existence of previous experience of ict outsourcing also have positive effects on a firm s propensity to adopt cc  on the contrary  employees ict skills  price and quality competition do not affect cc adoption propensity  finally  our results also indicate that in the three examined sectors firm size has no significant influence on the propensity to adopt cc  
 an empirical investigation of the factors motivating japanese repeat consumers to review their shopping experiences consumers purchase items  e g   food  online due to today s rapidly changing markets and to improvements in online and mobile technology  online supermarkets have been gaining popularity among japanese consumers  as the population experiences a hectic lifestyle and is aging  many japanese consumers are seeing the benefits of shopping on an online supermarket website  however  as with any e commerce activity  reviews are critical for the success of these e vendors  despite the importance of reviews  little is known about what motivates repeat online supermarket consumers to review their purchasing experiences  this paper examines consumers  willingness to review and the relationship between consumers  search attributes such as price  promotion and service  e satisfaction and trust on their online supermarket purchase experiences  the research findings support the results of earlier studies that search attributes are determinants of consumers  e satisfaction  in addition  e satisfaction affects e trust  interestingly  e trust has a negative effect on the willingness to review  
 an empirical study of the telecommunications service industries using productivity decomposition telecommunications service industry provides services that transmit voice  data  text  sound  video  and other signals  in the internet age  the telecommunications service industry has experienced tremendous growth to form an indispensable infrastructure platform for today s global networked economy  in this study  we examine the output performance of telecommunications service industries in 13 organization of economic cooperation and development countries from 2000 to 2011 using the malmquist total factor productivity index  mtfpi  as the performance metric and data envelopment analysis as the measurement approach  we further decompose mtfpi into three factors  1  technical change  2  pure efficiency change  and 3  scale efficiency change  that represent innovation  catch up  and demand fluctuation  respectively  the results show that these telecommunications service industries exhibit comparatively strong productivity growth  in addition  through our decomposition analysis  it is found that telecommunications service industry is an innovator skilled at adopting technological advances that turn out to be the key driving force for the observed productivity growth  by contrast  both pure efficiency change and scale efficiency change lead to negative impacts  based on these findings  we draw and discuss implications for telecommunications service at the country and industry levels  and provide suggestions for practice and future research

 an extrapolative model of house price dynamics a model in which homebuyers make a modest approximation leads house prices to display three features present in the data but usually missing from rational models  momentum at one year horizons  mean reversion at five year horizons  and excess longer term volatility relative to fundamentals  approximating buyers assume that past prices reflect only contemporaneous demand  just like professional economists who use trends in housing prices to infer trends in housing demand  consistent with survey evidence  this approximation leads buyers to expect increases in the market value of their homes after recent house price increases   c  2017 elsevier b v  all rights reserved  
 an inconvenient truth  how organizations translate climate change into business as usual climate change represents the grandest of challenges facing humanity  in the space of two centuries of industrial development  human civilization has changed the chemistry of the atmosphere and oceans  with devastating consequences  business organizations are central to this challenge  in that they support the production of escalating greenhouse gas emissions but also offer innovative ways to decarbonize our economies  in this paper  we examine how businesses respond to climate change  based on five in depth case studies of major australian corporations over a 10 year period  2005 2015   we identify three key stages in the corporate translation of climate change  framing  localizing  and normalizing  we develop a grounded model that explains how the revolutionary import of grand challenges is converted into the mundane and comfortable concerns of  business as usual   we find that critique is the major driver of this process by continuously revealing the tensions between the demands of the grand challenge and business imperatives  our paper contributes to the literature on business and the natural environment by identifying how and why corporate environmental initiatives deteriorate over time  more specifically  we highlight the policy limitations of a reliance on business and market responses to the climate crisis  
 an innovation activity model for very small entities in the software sector  an empirical study innovation management is a subdiscipline of management that studies the rules that govern the generation  diffusion  adoption of innovation  and relationships between innovation inputs and outputs  a great number of innovative products and services depend on software  in the software industry  many small entities act as subcontractors that develop components that are later integrated into larger industrial systems  however  these small entities do not have the resources needed to support long term r d activities and they also lack innovation management models which makes the planning and execution of innovation management difficult  these same small enterprises face similar challenges in the software development process  however  the iso iec 29110 standard provides small enterprises with a clear path in implementing a systematic software development process  the planning and execution of innovation management activities may also benefit from a similar approach  this article describes an innovation activity model suited to the characteristics of small entities whose main stream of revenue is software development  using the existing literature  standards  and the practical experience of companies with a successful history of developing innovative software based products  this study identifies the activities and practices that lead to the development of innovative products  interfaces between innovation management activities  software development processes  and work products are also identified

 an investigation of customer satisfaction with low cost and full service airline companies using a survey of 382 passengers  this research examines customer satisfaction and its antecedents and consequences in the context of the airline industry  the relationships among airline tangibles  quality of personnel  satisfaction with the airline  the intention to repurchase and intention to recommend the airline are examined  the findings indicate that tangibles and personnel quality positively affect satisfaction  and satisfaction positively influences intentions to both repurchase and recommend  the key contribution is to test the moderating effect of the airline type  a low cost vs  a full service carrier  the results reveal a significant moderating effect of airline type on two relationships  personnel quality   satisfaction and satisfaction   repurchase intention  specifically  the positive effect of quality of personnel on satisfaction is weaker for the low cost versus full service airline  while the positive effect of satisfaction on repurchase intent is stronger for the low cost airline  the study also discusses implications for airline carriers  
 an investigation on early voluntary withdrawals from individual retirement accounts  an empirical study on an emerging market early withdrawals from individual retirement accounts are one of the main problems of pension companies in both developed and emerging countries  the aim of this study is to identify the potential reasons behind decisions to withdraw early from the individual retirement system in turkey  using cox proportional hazards model  we find that there is a significant negative relationship between financial literacy and withdrawal probability  our results reveal that men and younger individuals are more likely to make an early withdrawal  we also find that individuals who experience liquidity constraints and income shocks tend to withdraw their contracts earlier  further analysis suggests that the effect of variables remarkably changes among different subgroups  we believe that our findings will assist both pension managers and policymakers to design better retirement plans and to take steps to prevent voluntary withdrawals in the long term  
 an organizational ethic of care and employee involvement in sustainability related behaviors  a social identity perspective we expand on the emergent research of an ethic of care  eoc  to theorize why and how an organizational eoc fosters employee involvement in sustainability related behaviors at work  across two studies  we explore the socio psychological mechanisms that link an eoc and involvement in sustainability related behaviors  the results of study 1  in which we applied an experimental design  indicate that an eoc is significantly related  through employees  affective reaction towards organizational sustainability  to involvement in sustainability related behaviors  in study 2  in which we used time lagged data  we further drew on social identity theory to suggest that an eoc is both directly and indirectly  through enhanced organizational identification  related to employees  satisfaction with organizational sustainability  through these two mechanisms  we explain the process by which an eoc can drive employee involvement in sustainability related behaviors  these theoretical developments and empirical findings help to better understand the micro foundations of organizational sustainability by building upon the moral theorizing of care

 analyst forecast accuracy and media independence using a large international sample of 47 307 firm years from 52 countries  we investigate the impact of media independence on the forecast quality of financial analysts  we find that analyst forecast errors are positively associated with the extent of a country s state media ownership and its lack of freedom of the press  we also find that financial analysts with more inaccurate forecasts disappear from the institutional broker s estimate system more quickly in countries with more independent media  
 analyzing online consumer behavior in mobile and pc devices  a novel web usage mining approach we investigate and compare online consumer behavior on an e retailer website in mobile versus pc devices  through the application of a web usage mining approach on clickstream data recorded in server side log files  online consumer behavior is characterized through both engagement measures and the discovery of common sequences of navigation patterns  using an innovative approach that combines footstep graph visualization with sequential association rule mining  we find that sessions conducted through mobile devices are more likely to consist of task oriented behavior whereas sessions conducted through pc devices are characterized by a more exploration oriented browsing behavior  moreover  we find that certain sequence rules are associated with an increased likelihood of purchase in both mobile and pc sessions  the results demonstrate the value of our approach in analyzing online browsing behavior  across platforms  in the context of electronic retailing   c  2017 elsevier b v  all rights reserved  
 analyzing the operation of cloud supply chain  adoption barriers and business model although on demand cloud services are considered to be cost saving solution for small and medium sized enterprises  data security and cloud interoperability remain the major barriers for the adoption of cloud services  in addition  the operation of a cloud supply chain consisting of an independent software vendor  isv  and software as a service provider may be inefficient without an automatic centralized platform for bundling and delivering isvs  applications to subscribers  in fact  these concerns can be resolved if all applications follow the same procedures to work together  therefore  this study examines the operation of a cloud supply chain in which an intermediary offers a packaging service  the service helps isvs wrap their applications according to a specific industry standard  this can reduce cost and time needed for deploying and updating applications  by examining an isv s channel selection and an intermediary s pricing offer  our approach helps identify the conditions under which the selling channel is more profitable for the isv  in addition  the importance of dual channel is highlighted when the intermediary becomes the isv s cloud partner  however  the adoption of dual channel does not lead to the highest profit if the quality of the software product is inadequate  we also find that the intermediary has to lower the service fee when there are lots of barriers to cloud adoption  even if the importance of the packaging service increases with the adoption cost  finally  we find that the r d for reducing adoption barriers implemented by the isv may increase or damage the profit of the intermediary  which depends upon the benefits gained from its packaging service

 anxious relationships  the unmarked futures for post normal scenarios in anticipatory systems this article explores organisational anticipation in uncertain times   anticipation  is interpreted as a mediating process between knowledge and action  where  feed forward  is causal  the context for examining organisational anticipation is one of ontological insecurity  raising issues of epistemological and therefore methodological uncertainty  the paper draws on re emerging areas of study in the futures literature especially with respect to anticipatory systems and post normal science  rosen s 1985 theory of anticipatory systems is not well known  though has received recent attention as part of a growing discourse on anticipation  for example as a possible discipline and as a form of governance  for rosen  causality is mediated through a modelling relationship between actor and environment which entails causality  not by the direct effect of the environment on the actor  the paper discusses the implications of this perspective on the role of scenario planning in organisations  which is but one of multiple anticipatory systems at work in the organisation and hence often weak in power  the argument is further developed by considering  modelling relations  which are inherent to active anticipatory systems  the conclusion is that in human social systems in uncertain environments require approaches to anticipation that recognise the multiplicity of modelling relations  one approach to this has been set out in earlier work by funtowicz and ravetz  1993   which they called post normal science  the paper concludes by suggesting that the epistemology of anticipatory systems and methodology developed from pns might be used to reduce cartesian anxiety with respect to ontological insecurities of uncertain times  this has radical implications for scenario planning as it is currently conceived   c  2016 elsevier inc  all rights reserved  
 application of two under researched typologies in crisis communication  ethics of justice vs  care and public relations vs  legal strategies this study investigates organizations  crisis responses by adopting two extant  under researched typologies public relations vs  legal strategies and ethics of justice vs  care approaches  through content analyzing organizational responses to three well known crises  the study observes that the public relations strategy is used more often than the legal strategy  it also finds that when the examined organizations respond to their crises  they tend not to emphasize ethical approaches  though when they do it is more often the ethics of justice approach than that of the ethics of care  therefore  this study urges organizations to reflect on whether their crisis communication and management decisions lack sufficient emphasis on ethical approaches  especially on the interpersonal and situational aspects of involved publics in crises  if such deficiency exits  it would be problematic because these interpersonal and situational aspects  when addressed strategically  can help an organization to rebuild post crisis reputation and maintain positive relationships with its publics in the long run

 are  sea turtles  slower  returnee entrepreneurs  venture resources and speed of entrepreneurial entry we add to neglected research on how venture resources and founder experience outside the home country interplay in facilitating venture creation speed  in particular  we investigate how returnee entrepreneurs influence the role of venture resources in the speed of entrepreneurial entry  using a novel sample of 388 new ventures covering a range of technologies in china  we find that returnees from abroad are slower in new venture entry in the home country  compared with homegrown entrepreneurs  at the same time  ventures with innovative technology and backed by foreign capital are slower to set up due to higher levels of liability of newness and liability of foreignness  however  when these firms have a returnee founder who can leverage their experience with foreign resources and technological knowhow  such negative effects on entry speed are significantly mitigated  we discuss implications for further research and practice   c  2017 published by elsevier inc  
 are corporate inversions good for shareholders  corporate inversion  the process of redomiciling for tax purposes  reduces corporate income taxes  but it imposes a personal tax cost that is shareholder specific  we develop a model  incorporating the corporate tax benefits and personal tax costs  to quantify the return to inversion for different shareholders  foreign and tax exempt investors  along with the chief executive officer  disproportionately benefit  we show that an inversion simultaneously reduces the wealth of many taxable shareholders  the model illustrates an agency conflict in which heterogeneity in personal taxes generates a wealth transfer between shareholders  furthermore  personal taxes offset the loss in government revenue by 39    c  2017 elsevier b v  all rights reserved  
 are correlations constant  empirical and theoretical results on popular correlation models in finance multivariate garch models have been designed as an extension of their univariate counterparts  such a view is appealing from a modeling perspective but imposes correlation dynamics that are similar to time varying volatility  in this paper  we argue that correlations are quite different in nature  we demonstrate that the highly unstable and erratic behavior that is typically observed for the correlation among financial assets is to a large extent a statistical artifact  we provide evidence that spurious correlation dynamics occur in response to financial events that are sufficiently large to cause a structural break in the time series of correlations  a measure for the autocovariance structure of conditional correlations allows us to formally demonstrate that the volatility and the persistence of daily correlations are not primarily driven by financial news but by the level of the underlying true correlation  our results indicate that a rolling window sample correlation is often a better choice for empirical applications in finance   c  2017 elsevier b v  all rights reserved  
 are excess cash holdings more valuable to firms in times of crisis  financial constraints and governance matters this study examines the impact of cash holdings on firm value before and during the 2008 financial crisis  conditional on financial constraints and corporate governance  we show that the equity market places a higher value on corporate cash holdings during the financial crisis and cash holdings are more valuable to constrained firms  compared to unconstrained firms  however  the triple interaction of cash with constraints and crisis shows the crisis value effect for constrained firms is weaker than for unconstrained firms  further  the triple interaction of excess cash with governance and constraints shows that a positive governance effect on corporate cash holdings is more pronounced for firms that are financially constrained   c  2016 elsevier b v  all rights reserved

 artrepreneurship and learning in ethnic markets many scholarly studies point to the growing cultural diversity in the marketplace and subsequent cultural learning mechanisms adapted by marketers and consumers  this research advances the theoretical and instrumental understanding of cultural learning mechanisms adopted by a specific form of entrepreneurs called ethnic artrepreneurs  using interview data with 16 ethnic artrepreneurs  the study finds that ethnic artrepreneurs  learning is cyclical in nature consisting of interconnecting stages  following  kolb s  1984  experiential learning theory  the study labels and discusses emerging themes as per four stages  concrete experience  reflective observation  abstract conceptualization  and active experimentation  the study represents an attempt to identify artrepreneurship as a strategic resource for marketing in ethnic markets  
 asia s materialists  reconciling collectivism and materialism materialism has an ugly face  the dominant view of materialism regards materialists as self prioritizing individuals who oppose collective and prosocial goals in favor of a lifestyle led by money  possessions  and status  the present research argues that there is a side of materialism that is concerned with collective oriented interests  we examine the nature and consequences of collective oriented materialism   the belief system that ascribes importance to possessions for their symbolic and signaling capacities to construct desirable social attributes  drawing from cultural and consumer theories  we find considerable support that materialists espouse a collective oriented quality to an otherwise self oriented interest towards possessions

 assessing the impact of customer concentration on initial public offering and balance sheet based outcomes using the notion of customer concentration  the authors argue that firms should evenly spread their revenues across their customers  rather than focusing on a few major customer relationships  prior literature suggests that major customers improve efficiency and provide access to resources  thereby producing positive performance outcomes  however  building on industrial organizational literature and modern portfolio theory  the authors argue that concentration of revenues reduces the supplier firm s bargaining power relative to its customers and hurts the ability of the supplier firm to appropriate value  which  in turn  hurts profits  using a sample of 1 023 initial public offerings  ipos  and robust econometric methods  they find that customer concentration reduces investor uncertainty and positively impacts ipo outcomes  but significantly hurts balance sheet based outcomes  e g   profitability   the results suggest that a 10  increase in customer concentration reduces profitability by 3 35   or about  7 million  in the subsequent year  or 9 4  cumulatively over the next four years  or about  20 32 million   further  the authors find that the negative effects of customer concentration decrease with increase in organizational  marketing  technological  and operational  capabilities and increase with low customer credit quality

 assigned versus assumed  towards a contemporary  detailed understanding of subsidiary autonomy this paper critically documents the rise of autonomy in subsidiary management literature  and develops an agenda for future research in this key area  integrating and updating the seminal works of paterson and brock  2002  and young and tavares  2004   the paper begins with a critical review of subsidiary autonomy within the streams of subsidiary management literature  this leads to an assessment of the key contemporary issues requiring further investigation  these issues center around two key types of autonomy  assigned and assumed  we argue these types represent a more accurate  in depth conceptualization of subsidiary autonomy  and also have significant implications for key related topics  including subsidiary development  this is depicted in an integrative model that draws upon agency theory  the network model of the mne  the decision process perspective and the bundling model in presenting a revised view of subsidiary autonomy  and offers a basis for further research within the field  
 assignment of collaborators to multiple business problems using genetic algorithm as firms encounter new problems in the fast changing business environment  they have to find collaborators with problem solving expertise  since this optimization problem takes place in a firm as the business environment changes  genetic algorithm  ga   which has shown outstanding performance in obtaining a sub optimal solution relatively quickly  seems to be the right solution  one that is superior to goal programming  multi attribute decision making  and branch and bound  we therefore propose a ga based approach to solving the problem of assigning collaborators to multiple business problems  our solution worked well in several experiments  
 asymmetric correlation as an explanation for the effect of asset skewness on equity returns assets with asymmetric correlation tend to cause portfolios to have negative skewness  we develop measures of asymmetric correlation based on portfolio skewness  we find that asymmetric correlation is better measured with the skewness of smaller portfolios  the skewness of individual stock returns has the most significant and consistent explanatory power for stock returns  indicating that asymmetric correlation is generated at the asset level of individual firms  
 asymmetries abound  ideological differences in emotion  partisanship  motivated reasoning  social network structure  and political trust this article is a response to rao  2017   krishna and sokolova  2017   and oyserman and schwarz  2017   all of whom provided extremely thoughtful commentaries on a target article in which i summarized several lines of research in political psychology on liberal conservative differences in personality  cognition  motivation  values  and neurological structures and functions  jost  2017a   i begin by correcting a possible misconception  namely that the theory of political ideology as motivated social cognition cannot explain dynamic shifts in ideological affinities  on the contrary  we have demonstrated that  top down  situational as well as  bottom up  dispositional processes work in conjunction to produce ideological outcomes  and this is why tailored forms of political persuasion can be highly effective in producing change  next i describe additional evidence  including previously unpublished evidence  bearing on ideological symmetries and asymmetries with respect to emotion  partisanship  social identification  motivated reasoning  social network structure  and political trust  i end by asking consumer psychologists for their continued collaboration in addressing profound challenges associated with understanding and reconciling sources of ideological divergence not only for the sake of research in behavioral science but also for the smooth functioning of democratic society   c  2017 society for consumer psychology  published by elsevier inc  all rights reserved  
 asymmetry in spillover effects  evidence for international stock index futures markets the paper investigates the asymmetry in return and volatility spillovers across futures markets with non overlapping stock exchange trading hours  the transmission of positive and negative return and volatility shocks is analysed for 104 channels of information conveyance identified by combining 9 developed and 11 emerging markets in markets pairs with non overlapping trading hours  the asymmetric causality test is employed to daily stock index futures returns and volatilities for the period from 03 october 2010 to 03 october 2014  the paper sheds light on the relatively little explored concept of asymmetry in return and volatility spillovers across markets  providing novel evidence on stabilizing and destabilizing spillover effects   c  2017 elsevier inc  all rights reserved  
 attracting new customers to loyalty programs  the effectiveness of monetary versus nonmonetary loyalty programs what type of reward attracts customers to loyalty programs  given the increasing importance of loyalty programs  this question matters  six sequential studies investigated whether monetary rewards universally attract people more than nonmonetary rewards  results suggest that monetary rewards elicit a very robust attractiveness premium both on the level of individual rewards as well as on the level of entire reward programs  across different industries  the more monetary loyalty program was consistently perceived as more attractive  and it was more likely to inspire intentions to join the program  even in light of variations in consumption goals  hedonic vs  utilitarian   the effect persisted  the effect is not only consistent  it is also nonnegligible with medium effect sizes emerging in most settings  we discuss ensuing variations in effect sizes and conclude that monetarism holds a pervasive temptation for consumers that managers cannot ignore  
 attraction or distraction  corporate social responsibility in macao s gambling industry this paper attempts to investigate how and why organisations in macao s gambling industry engage in corporate social responsibility  csr   it is based on an in depth investigation of macao s gambling industry with 49 semi structured interviews  conducted in 2011  we found that firms within the industry were emphasising pragmatic legitimacy based on both economic and non economic contributions  in order to project positive images of the industry  while glossing over two domains of adverse externalities  problem gambling among visitors  and the pollution and despoliation of the environment  by engaging symbolically rather than substantively in csr  the gambling firms were diverting attention away from issues of moral legitimacy  in order to be allowed to continue to pursue  business as usual  as a means of obtaining substantial financial returns in a social  cultural and sociopolitical context that was exerting relatively little public pressure to improve corporate social and environmental performance  we conjecture that the gambling firms were feeding on borrowed time  
 audit firms face downward sloping demand curves and the audit market is far from perfectly competitive we discuss the discrete choice demand estimation methods applied by guo et al   2017  in the audit setting  we then review insights into audit market competition that demand estimation has already provided  we conclude that the audit market is far from perfectly competitive  
 auditor selection and corporate social responsibility this study examines the association between the selection of an industry specialist auditor and corporate social responsibility  csr   we find that firms with higher csr ratings are more likely to hire industry specialist auditors  national level industry leaders  city level industry leaders or joint city national industry leaders   moreover  firms with better csr performance related to product quality and the environment in controversial industries are found to select non specialized auditors  the results suggest that such firms may overinvest in csr activities associated with the environment and product issues to disguise the sin nature of their manufactured goods  and simultaneously engage low quality auditors perhaps to avoid full disclosure of potential environmental and legal liabilities  overall  we conclude that csr is associated with the non controversial firms ensuring high quality financial reporting in response to societal expectations  and thus csr firms in such industries have strong incentives to engage industry specialist auditors  
 augmenting the eye of the beholder  exploring the strategic potential of augmented reality to enhance online service experiences driven by the proliferation of augmented reality  ar  technologies  many firms are pursuing a strategy of service augmentation to enhance customers  online service experiences  drawing on situated cognition theory  the authors show that ar based service augmentation enhances customer value perceptions by simultaneously providing simulated physical control and environmental embedding  the resulting authentic situated experience  manifested in a feeling of spatial presence  functions as a mediator and also predicts customer decision comfort  furthermore  the effect of spatial presence on utilitarian value perceptions is greater for customers who are disposed toward verbal rather than visual information processing  and the positive effect on decision comfort is attenuated by customers  privacy concerns  
 augmenting the intertemporal capm with inflation  further evidence from alternative models studies consistently find that inflation is an important augmented factor for intertemporal capital asset pricing models  icapms  when pricing the fama french 25 size and book to market portfolios  we extend this line of research by investigating two alternative icapm models  from michel  hahn and lee  and the three factor model from hou et al  we find significant evidence that both icapms and hou et al  s three factor model perform better when augmented with inflation than the original models  the augmented models achieve a good model fit with the fewest factors  thus avoiding or alleviating the over fitting problem  
 automated liquidity provision over the last decade  the task of liquidity provision in many markets has shifted from traditional market makers to autonomous  computerized trading systems  these automated systems collect  process  and react to market wide information quicker and more comprehensively than the humans they have replaced  here  we update the model of glosten and milgrom  1985  to analyze how the automation of liquidity provision affects market quality  the transaction costs of market participants  and volatility  to glosten and milgrom s original model  we add multiple securities and introduce an automated market maker who prices order flow for all securities contemporaneously  we find that the automated market maker transacts the majority of orders  sets prices that are more efficient  increases informed and decreases uninformed traders  transaction costs  and has no effect on volatility  the model s predictions match very well with recent empirical findings and are difficult to replicate with alternative models   c  2016 published by elsevier b v  
 b2c smart retailing  a consumer focused value based analysis of interactions and synergies the paper transcends the simply functional and oligo dimensional approach to smart retailing  in order to provide a comprehensive  value based analysis of its b2c relationship  methodologically  it is a theoretically developed conceptual work  refined through qualitative primary research  specifically  combining narrative and meta synthetic literature analyses with interviews it undertakes an extensive theoretical review on the subject and its peripheral and contextual factors  it identifies the value categories and individual elements  which explicitly or implicitly define the smart retailing b2c relationships and synergies  and prescriptively incorporates all into a single  provisional  value based  multi dimensional framework for b2c smart retailing  the findings give rise to  value  as superior means of understanding the smart retailing b2c relationship and as the ultimate ends on both sides of the relationship  both largely consequent to the changing underlying contemporary business and consumer motivators  additionally  smart retailing  soft value  manifestations are delineated and proposed as particular sources of retailers  lasting and inimitable competitive advantages  while smart retailing itself is found to have outgrown its traditional role to become a holistic strategic approach to the retailing business   c  2016 elsevier inc  all rights reserved  
 bad company  the indirect effect of differences in corporate governance in the pension plan industry this paper analyses the role played by pension plan governance structure and how it impacts on plan fees and plan performance  the results clearly show that fees decrease significantly and performance improves when pension plan governance structures permit full alignment of interests and allow greater capacity for the decision makers to monitor and discipline the managers  it is also observed that companies managing both employee and individual funds  tend to exploit differences in the internal corporate governance mechanisms of each type of plan in order to nurture employer sponsored plans at the expense of individual plans  these results suggest that internal corporate governance mechanisms allowing closer alignment with the interests of participants would be preferable to focusing exclusively on setting the minimum proportion of independent directors  
 baidu news coverage and its impacts on order imbalance and large size trade of chinese stocks in this paper  we introduce a novel proxy for media coverage by employing the number of news appeared in baidu news and investigate its impacts on order imbalance and large size trade in the chinese stock market  by dividing the trading periods into news periods  np  and no news periods  nnp   the empirical results show that  1  trading volume in the nnp is significantly larger than that in the np   2  large size trade in the nnp is significantly larger than that in the np  and  3  the difference of order imbalance in nnp and np is less significant compared with large size trade  taken together  these results suggest that there exists institutional trading in the trading periods without media coverage   c  2017 elsevier inc  all rights reserved  
 balancing difficulty of performance targets  theory and evidence we examine how firms balance difficulty of performance targets in their annual bonus plans  we present an analytical model showing that managerial allocation of effort is a function of not only relative incentive weights but also the difficulty of performance targets  we find that relative incentive weights and target difficulty can either be complements or substitutes in motivating effort depending on the extent to which managers have alternative employment opportunities  to test the predictions of our model  we use survey data on performance targets in annual bonus plans  our sample of 877 survey respondents consists primarily of financial executives in small  and medium size private companies where annual bonuses are important both for motivation and retention  consistent with our model  we find that relative incentive weights are negatively  positively  associated with perceived target difficulty when concerns about managerial retention are high  low   it follows that performance measures included in annual bonus plans have sometimes easy and other times challenging targets depending on their relative incentive weights and retention concerns

 bank competition and leverage adjustments we test whether bank competition affects firms  leverage adjustment speeds  using chinese data where bank concentration varies across both years and provinces  we find that underlevered firms move to their target leverage faster when bank competition is high  tests surrounding an exogenous shock to bank competition lead to the same conclusion  we also find that small firms and nonstate owned firms exhibit faster leverage adjustments when bank competition is high  which is consistent with the conjecture that bank risk taking increases with competition  
 bank earnings and regulatory capital management using available for sale securities based on a large sample of publicly listed and non listed us commercial banks from 1996 to 2011  we find robust evidence consistent with banks using realized available for sale  afs  securities gains and losses to smooth earnings and increase low regulatory capital  we also find that  i  banks with positive earnings smooth earnings  and banks with negative earnings generally take big baths   ii  regulatory capital constrains big baths   iii  banks with more negative earnings and more unrealized beginning of quarter losses  gains  take big baths  smooth earnings   and  iv  banks with low regulatory capital and more unrealized gains realize more gains  also  banks with negative earnings take big baths  avoid or reduce the earnings loss  if their unrealized gains are insufficient  sufficient  to offset the negative earnings  our inferences apply to listed and non listed banks  which indicates that the earnings management incentives do not derive solely from public capital markets  our findings reveal that the accounting for afs securities gains and losses enables banks to manage regulatory capital and earnings in a variety of ways  
 bank exposures and sovereign stress transmission  using novel monthly data for 226 euro area banks from 2007 to 2015  we investigate the determinants of banks  sovereign exposures and their effects on lending during and after the crisis  public  bailed out and poorly capitalized banks responded to sovereign stress by purchasing domestic public debt more than other banks  consistent with both the  moral suasion  and the  carry trade  hypothesis  public banks  purchases grew especially in coincidence with the largest ecb liquidity injections  which therefore reinforced the  moral suasion  mechanism  bank exposures significantly amplified the impact of sovereign stress on bank lending to domestic firms  as well as on lending by foreign subsidiaries of stressed country banks to firms in non stressed countries  altogether  our evidence connects this amplification effect and its cross border transmission to the moral suasion exerted by domestic governments on banks during the crisis  
 bank market power  asset liquidity and funding liquidity  international evidence our investigation of the association between bank market power and liquidity in 101 countries reveals that a bank s initial gains of market power lead to increases in bank liquidity  but does so at a diminishing rate  beyond an empirically determined threshold  further increases in market power are inversely associated with bank liquidity  from a cross sectional viewpoint  banks that lack market power hold more liquid assets and are net lenders in the interbank market  in contrast  dominant banks hold less liquid assets and are net interbank borrowers  for a given level of market power  ceteris paribus  developed nation banks hold less asset liquidity and obtain more interbank funding liquidity than their developing country peers  these results remain equally relevant during the 2007 2009 global financial crisis  gfc    c  2017 elsevier inc  all rights reserved

 banks  internal capital markets and deposit rates it is commonly believed that deposit rates are determined primarily by supply  depositors require higher deposit rates from risky banks  thereby creating market discipline  an alternative perspective is that market discipline is limited  e g   due to deposit insurance and or enhanced capital regulation  and that internal demand for funding by banks determines rates  using branch level deposit rate data  we find little evidence for market discipline as rates are similar across bank capitalization levels  in contrast  banks  loan growth has a causal effect on deposit rates  for example  branches  deposit rates are correlated with loan growth in other states in which their bank has some presence  suggesting internal capital markets help reallocate the bank s funding

 basel iii versus solvency ii  an analysis of regulatory consistency under the new capital standards this article provides a critical analysis of the consistency of the standard approaches for market and credit risks under solvencyii and the current and forthcoming baseliii standards  the comparability is assessed both theoretically via a detailed comparison of the capital standards and in a numerical analysis that contrasts the capital charges for a stylized portfolio  our examination reveals substantial discrepancies in the design of the frameworks  these lead to vastly differing capital requirements for the same risks  moreover  the analysis indicates higher charges for banks than insurers  especially under the proposed new baseliii standard approaches  
 battle on the wrong field  entrant type  dominant designs  and technology exit research summary  startups often compete with diversifying entrants in the technology race to define dominant designs  which can be platform technology based or non platform technology based  however  little research has examined the relative risk of technological exits for startups vs  diversifying entrants in such dominance battles  we develop a contingency framework that links a firm s technology exit to its pre entry experience and the characteristics of the dominance battle  with a sample of 134 technologies involved in 31 dominance battles in the information technology industry from 1979 to 2007  we show that technologies of startups were more likely than those of diversifying entrants to exit from platform technology based dominance battles  however  this relationship did not exist in non platform technology based dominance battles  or after the emergence of dominant designs managerial summary  how can a startup that tries to create a dominant design strategize to survive the fierce technology race  this study demonstrates that choosing the right battlefield is of paramount importance  two aspects of a battlefield are shown as relevant  the type of technology and the stage of industrial evolution  our results show that technologies sponsored by startups tend to have higher exit rates than those sponsored by diversifying entrants in dominance battles characterized by platform technologies  but this penalty is not evident in dominance battles characterized by non platform technologies or after the emergence of dominant designs  furthermore  our study suggests that lack of organizational legitimacy  complementary assets  and integrative capabilities may explain why startups have a higher risk of technology exit than diversifying entrants  copyright  c  2017 john wiley   sons  ltd  
 benchmarks in search markets we characterize the role of benchmarks in price transparency of over the counter markets  a benchmark can raise social surplus by increasing the volume of beneficial trade  facilitating more efficient matching between dealers and customers  and reducing search costs  although the market transparency promoted by benchmarks reduces dealers  profit margins  dealers may nonetheless introduce a benchmark to encourage greater market participation by investors  low cost dealers may also introduce a benchmark to increase their market share relative to high cost dealers  we construct a revelation mechanism that maximizes welfare subject to search frictions  and show conditions under which it coincides with announcing the benchmark  
 better safe than sorry  subsidiary performance feedback and internal governance in multiunit firms this paper explores the link between subsidiary performance feedback and internal governance mechanisms in multiunit firms  a central premise of performance feedback models is that performance below aspirations is associated with increased risk tolerance and thereby with a higher likelihood of taking excessive risks in resource allocation decisions  building on this observation  we contend that the headquarters of multiunit firms take this association into account in the design of internal  i e   headquarters subsidiary  governance mechanisms  accordingly  a subsidiary s performance aspiration gap  below aspirations  is positively associated with the headquarters  oversight of its resource allocation decisions and negatively associated with the provision of incentive schemes that promote risk taking  regression results  using data on subsidiaries in france between 1998 and 2004  support our hypotheses and show that subsidiaries performing below historical and social aspirations are less likely to be given discretion in investment decisions and incentivized by cash bonuses  in the supplementary analyses  we also provide suggestive evidence that subsidiary performance problems in multiunit firms trigger structural adaptation in the internal governance mechanisms in pursuit of regaining fit  
 beyond environmental regulations  exploring the potential of  eco islam  in boosting environmental ethics within smes in arab markets the recent global increase in environmental regulation does not necessarily signal improvement in firms  ecological imprints  like many markets  the arab world is struggling to implement environmental compliance measures among local firms  for arab countries  the reliance solely on formal policies to improve local firms  ecological footprints may be risky given the evident institutional challenges to enforce environmental regulations  specially post the arab spring  drawing from the literature highlighting the merits of combining formal and informal controls to ensure successful implementation of a strategy  we argue that the emphasis for regulation must be accompanied by an emphasis for developing environmental ethics of individuals  who are the expected implementers of any environmental policy  in that light  we propose that the eco islam phenomenon can serve as an influential and effective foundation for building organizational cultures with stronger environmental ethics among local small and medium enterprises  smes   we explain the underlying maxims of eco islam then conduct qualitative research among experts preaching or practicing the concept to gain better insights into the potential of leveraging it in muslim majority arab countries  finally  we conclude with insightful implications for local smes in the region  
 beyond guilty verdicts  human rights litigation and its impact on corporations  human rights policies during the last years  there has been an increasing discussion on the role of business in human rights violations and an increase in human rights litigation against companies  the result of human rights litigation has been rather disillusioning because no corporation has been found guilty and most cases have been dismissed  we argue that it may nevertheless be a useful instrument for the advancement of the business and human rights agenda  we examine the determinants of successful human rights litigation in terms of judicial  educational  and regulatory effects  this article reviews more than 40 corporate foreign direct liability cases and their effects on corporate human rights policies and conduct  the review shows that most corporations adjusted their human rights policies and adopted additional measures to cope with human rights issues during or shortly after the legal proceedings  opening legal channels for human rights litigation may be one way for governments to incentivize firms to respect human rights  these findings have implications for the united nations guiding principles on business and human rights as well as on our interpretation of the most recent u s  supreme court decision in kiobel v  shell

 big data  a normal accident waiting to happen  widespread commercial use of the internet has significantly increased the volume and scope of data being collected by organisations   big data  has emerged as a term to encapsulate both the technical and commercial aspects of this growing data collection activity  to date  much of the discussion of big data has centred upon its transformational potential for innovation and efficiency  yet there has been less reflection on its wider implications beyond commercial value creation  this paper builds upon normal accident theory  nat  to analyse the broader ethical implications of big data  it argues that the strategies behind big data require organisational systems that leave them vulnerable to normal accidents  that is to say some form of accident or disaster that is both unanticipated and inevitable  whilst nat has previously focused on the consequences of physical accidents  this paper suggests a new form of system accident that we label data accidents  these have distinct  less tangible and more complex characteristics and raise significant questions over the role of individual privacy in a  data society   the paper concludes by considering the ways in which the risks of such data accidents might be managed or mitigated

 blocked but not tackled  who founds new firms when rivals dissolve  research summary  this article examines the role of competitive shocks in creating opportunities for new firm foundings  i argue that the sudden dissolution of rival firms may release resources that create opportunities for firm formation  particularly among employees facing impediments to capturing value in their current organizations  analyzing microdata from the legal services industry  i use unexpected deaths of solo practicing attorneys as quasi exogenous sources of rival dissolution  results indicate that these shocks increase the odds of founding by about 30   with stronger effects among attorneys with weaker social connections or higher competition for promotion  the article thus highlights the role that founders play in reallocating dissolved rivals  resources while demonstrating that founding may be an important outlet for blocked employees to capture value from opportunities  managerial summary  this article finds that the shutdown and dissolution of a rival organization may spur employees to found new firms  as a consequence  managers may find it valuable to pay attention to employees  turnover intentions following the dissolution of a rival  findings suggest that employees who are having trouble advancing in the firm may be the most likely to found a new organization when a rival dissolves  so managers may want to focus retention efforts on these individuals  to the extent that managers wish to capture customers  employees  and other resources that were formerly attached to a dissolved rival  managers may wish to be aware that they could be in competition with their own employees for these resources and opportunities  copyright  c  2017 john wiley   sons  ltd  
 blue and red voices  effects of political ideology on consumers  complaining and disputing behavior political ideology plays a pivotal role in shaping individuals  attitudes  opinions  and behaviors  however  apart from a handful of studies  little is known about how consumers  political ideology affects their marketplace behavior  the authors used three large consumer complaint databases from the consumer financial protection bureau  national highway traffic safety administration  and federal communications commission in conjunction with a county level indicator of political ideology  the 2012us presidential election results  to demonstrate that conservative consumers are not only less likely than liberal consumers to report complaints but also less likely to dispute complaint resolutions  a survey also sheds light on the relationship between political ideology and complaint dispute behavior  due to stronger motivations to engage in  system justification   conservative  as opposed to liberal  consumers are less likely to complain or dispute  the present research offers a useful means of identifying those consumers most and least likely to complain and dispute  given that political ideology is more observable than most psychological factors and more stable than most situational factors  furthermore  this research and its theoretical framework open opportunities for future research examining the influence of political ideology on other marketplace behaviors  
 board accountability and risk taking in banking  evidence from a quasi experiment in this paper  a law reform is evaluated that aimed at improving the corporate governance of banks by tightening accountability and legal liability of outside directors  the causal effect of the reform on bank risk is identified by difference in differences and triple differences strategies  the estimation results show that banks subject to the reform increased capital and liquidity ratios  hence  designing board level governance can be an effective policy tool for altering the risk taking behavior of banks

 brand aid can close brand relationships insulate against physical pain  the idea that close interpersonal relationships help people cope with pain has received increasing support in social psychology  it is unknown  however  whether close brand relationships can do the same and  if so  why  seven studies are reported here to fill this knowledge gap  experiments 1a and 1b are the first to demonstrate that when confronted with a loved brand  vs  control   consumers are able to insulate themselves against physical pain  experiment 2 provides evidence that the pain insulating effectiveness of close brand relationships is not just due to brands representing mere distractions  using a multistudy  multimethod approach to test for mediation  experiments 3 through 5 provide convergent empirical support for the hypothesis that feelings of social connectedness mediate the effect of close brand relationships on pain  study 6 categorizes the 1 105 brand love essays written by participants in our experiments to show that loved brands provide feelings of social connectedness  mostly metaphorically and indirectly and  to a lesser extent  directly  in summary  close brand relationships can help insulate consumers against physical pain due to brands  ability to provide a semblance of social connectedness  
 brexit as the unlikely leading edge of the anti expert revolution in this invited piece  i deal with brexit as the leading edge of an ongoing anti expert revolution  i begin by considering brexit in relation to my own long standing anti expertist approach to social epistemology  which in many ways makes me a kindred spirit to the brexiteers  next  i turn to the struggle of parliamentary elites that eventuated in the win for brexit  focussing on the brexiteers  distinctive epistemic and ethical strategy with regard to public opinion  finally  i consider the unforeseen emergence of a rousseau style  general will  with regard to brexit  which is where british democracy stands for the foreseeable future  ending on the role of academia   and specifically business schools   in the anti expert revolution   c  2017 elsevier ltd  all rights reserved

 bringing a resource and capability lens to resource allocation this article highlights a perspective that has been underexplored in resource allocation research  by viewing resource allocation through a resource and capability lens  three connections are developed between resource based theories of strategy and strategy research on resource allocation  first  the lens is applied to frame capital investments as investing in capabilities  this framing provides a theoretical path connecting the strategic purpose of investments  through value creation from resource commitments  to the creation of competitive advantage  second  resource allocation for the purpose of capability development is related to a resource based model of asset accumulation  placing resource allocation decisions in the context of capability development suggests that key features of the asset accumulation process can usefully inform research on the resource allocation process  last  corporate capital allocation is connected to resource redeployment in multibusiness firms  this connection explicates ways in which corporate headquarters can add to firm value  these connections illustrate the potential that resource based theories have to contribute insights to resource allocation research  
 brothers in blood  yet strangers to global brand purchase  a four country study of the role of consumer personality although personality traits have repeatedly been shown to influence consumer behavior  their impact on willingness to buy global brands has yet to be empirically investigated  based on a four country sample  n   4539  of south east european consumers  we test alternative pathways linking consumer personality traits to global brand purchase intentions  our findings show that extraversion  neuroticism  conscientiousness and openness to experience impact purchase intentions mediated through consumers  global brand associations  domestic country bias and price sensitivity  implications of the findings for theory and practice are considered and future research directions identified  
 building a place brand from the bottom up  a case study from the united states in an increasingly competitive global marketplace  the need for towns and cities to create a unique identity  to differentiate themselves from competitors  has become critical  many places promote spectacular scenery  good quality of life  friendly people  and a sound business infrastructure  however  these factors are no longer differentiators  so places need a strong brand identity to stand out in order to attract people to live  work  and play  but brand development is often driven by short term top down approaches with limited community participation  where the primary tool of brand expression becomes the final marketing campaign  this article reports on a qualitative approach to build a place brand from the bottom up  with wide participation from all members of the community  with a methodology based on place brand building theory  charettes and in depth interviews were conducted with local stakeholders  resulting in a positioning statement that was used to develop brand communications materials  based on the research process and results of the case study  the authors present a community based place brand development model  
 building agent based decision support systems for word of mouth programs  a freemium application marketers must constantly decide how to implement word of mouth  wom  programs  and a well developed decision support system  dss  can provide them valuable assistance in doing so  the authors propose an agent based framework that aggregates social network level individual interactions to guide the construction of a successful dss for wom  the framework presents a set of guidelines and recommendations to  1  involve stakeholders   2  follow a data driven iterative modeling approach   3  increase validity through automated calibration  and  4  understand the dss behavior  this framework is applied to build a dss for a freemium app in which premium users discuss the product with their social network and promote its viral adoption  after its validation  the agent based dss forecasts the aggregate number of premium sales over time and the most likely users to become premium in the near future  the experiments show how the dss can help managers by forecasting premium conversions and increasing the number of premiums through targeting and implementing reward policies  
 building collaboration  co location and  dis location  in a railway control post this paper studies the design of co located spaces and how organizational actors experience such spaces  the literature on co location is ambiguous about how reduced physical distance increases collaboration  to address this problem  we draw on an ethnographic study of a co located railway control center  housing the largest dutch railway organizations under one roof  although the intention of the co location was to improve collaboration by bringing different organizations into closer proximity  our findings tell a different story  railway employees developed several territorial practices  preserving existing boundaries  creating new boundaries  and the situational use of boundaries  through which they resisted the design of the control center  thereby changing the control center from co located to  dis located   we argue that understanding the relationship between co location and collaboration should not only focus on how such spaces are designed but  rather  account for how spaces where collaboration is demanded are experienced and used by employees  
 building interfirm leadership  a relational identity perspective while leadership has been recognized as an approach to facilitating network orchestration  little is known about the mechanism through which a hub firm enhances interfirm leadership  grounded on the theory of social identity and network orchestration  we develop a framework of the enhancement of interfirm leadership  proposing that the tendency of building leadership rests on the hub firm s ability to shape the partners  relational identity  we identify three types of role adoption that indicate seven actions a hub firm might take to establish such an identity  we suggest that the mechanism through which leadership emerges is contingent on relationship duration  dependence asymmetry  and competition intensity  crown copyright  c  2017 published by elsevier ltd  all rights reserved  
 building new social capital with scenario planning practitioners have observed that scenario planning contributes to building new social capital  in scenario planning terms  new social capital can provide access to new information  novel strategic options and unprecedented collaborative opportunities  however  there is no description or explanation in the literature as to how scenario planning can build new social capital  reporting on research into the scenario planning process of two organizations  we find that scenario planning generates new social capital through learning with the conceptual future  which is a direct investment in building new shared systems of meaning the cognitive dimension of social capital  this then enables the structural and relational dimensions of new social capital to emerge as by products  the building of new social capital provides another purpose for scenario investments and another quality criterion by which to assess the value of these interventions  the insights of the research will be of interest to  scenario planning scholars  leaders interested in how to purposefully design and conduct scenario planning if a core intent is to build new social capital  and scholars interested in the cognitive dimension of social capital and its creation  
 burdens of access  understanding customer barriers and barrier attenuating practices in access based services access based services  abs   which grant customers limited access to goods without any transfer of ownership  are unique technology based service innovations requiring the substantial involvement and collaboration of customers without employees  supervision  although abs offer several potential advantages  convincing customers to use them remains challenging  combining 56 in depth interviews with supplementary literature  the authors address this challenge by proposing an integrative framework that reflects the  1  barriers that prevent customers from using abs and  2  practices in which customers engage to attenuate those barriers  the complex  multidimensional barriers relate not only to the service and technology features but also to other customers  customers can engage in different practices to attenuate perceived barriers and create value  namely   to distance    to manage    to elaborate    to control   and  to relate   yet  they regard these barrier attenuating practices as necessary sacrifices to use abs  complementing suggestions that customers adopt and use abs to escape the burdens of ownership  the current research reveals that customers actually may confront several  burdens of access   this research suggests managers who wish to reduce rejection of their innovation could not only overcome customers  perceived barriers but also facilitate and reduce the number of practices in which customers engage to attenuate those barriers themselves  
 business for good  an investigation into the strategies firms use to maximize the impact of financial corporate philanthropy on employee attitudes most research on the corporate philanthropy of organizations has focused on the external benefits of such initiatives for firms  such as benefits for firm reputation and opportunities  however  many firms justify their giving  in part  due to the positive impact it has on their employees  little is known about the effectiveness of such efforts  or how they can be managed strategically to maximize impact  we hypothesize a main effect of office level corporate philanthropy on average employee attitudes in that office  but also investigate three strategies that offices may use to enhance this impact  testing our hypotheses with 3 years of data on attitudes of an average of 14 577 employees in 53 offices we find support for the main effect  but mixed support for the specific strategies used to enhance impact  
 business group affiliation and post acquisition performance  an extended resource based view prior research on post acquisition performance suggests positive  negative  or no wealth creation for the acquiring firms  grounding our arguments on the extended resource based view  the current article proposes that business group affiliated firms leverage their affiliation advantages to attain superior long term acquisition performance  relative to standalone firms  especially in emerging economies such as india  additionally  we hypothesize that both within group heterogeneity  manifested as prior group experience  group diversification  and intra group variation in the form of horizontal ties through boards of directors  also affect the long term post acquisition performance of affiliated firms  the findings  obtained with a buy and hold abnormal returns method applied to a sample of 468 majority stake mergers and acquisitions  both domestic and cross border  by indian firms during 2005 2013  provide robust support for the theoretical arguments  
 business models as service strategy it is widely recognized that business models can serve as important strategic tools in innovation and market formation processes  consequently  business models should have a prominent position in the marketing literature  however  marketing scholars have  so far  paid little attention to the business model concept  perhaps because it lacks an established definition and clear theoretical foundation  this article offers a definition for the business model concept that  using a fractal approach  connects business models to technological and market innovation  furthermore  the article questions several cornerstone strategic concepts by reconceptualizing business model development from a firm centric activity that promotes owning key resources and altering sets of decision variables to one that highlights the facilitation of broad institutional change processes  as such  it takes the potentially controversial position of advocating a service strategy based understanding of business models for all of marketing strategy  
 calling all volunteers  the role of stewardship and involvement in volunteer organization relationships millions of people in the u s  volunteer  and understanding how organizations can retain and deepen relationships with these individuals is critical to the sustainability of the nonprofit sector  the relationship maintenance strategies of stewardship may help nonprofit organizations strengthen relationships with their volunteers  particularly if organizations are able to influence volunteers  feelings of involvement  an online survey of volunteers was conducted to see the relationships between stewardship  involvement  and organization public relationship  opr  outcomes  our path analysis model indicates that stewardship strategies can positively contribute to volunteers  involvement and their evaluations of opr outcomes  one of the few to test this model  this study contributes new theory to public relations literature and better informs the practice  
 can offline stores drive online sales  the authors use evidence from store openings by a bricks and clicks retailer to examine the drivers of substitution and complementarity between online and offline retail channels  the evidence supports the coexistence of substitution across channels and complementarity in demand  in places where the retailer has a strong presence  the opening of an offline store is associated with a decrease in online sales and search  however  in places where the retailer does not have a strong presence  the opening of an offline store is associated with an increase in online sales and search  the evidence suggests that whereas online and offline channels may be substitutes in distribution  they are complements in marketing communications  specifically  the type of marketing communication driving complementarity seems to be information about the existence of the brand  for example  the authors observe a large increase in new customer acquisition and sales  and little difference between fit and feel products and other products  thus  it is the presence of the store  rather than information about the attributes of the products in the store  that drives complementarity  
 capital markets  assessment of the economic impact of the dodd frank act on systemically important financial firms we examine stock and bond market reactions to the key events leading to the passage of the dodd frank act to assess the markets  expectations about the effectiveness of the act on systemically important financial firms  using small medium sized domestic financial institutions as a control group  we find that large financial institutions overall had negative abnormal stock returns and positive abnormal bond returns  suggesting that the markets expect the act to be effective in reducing these banks  risk taking  we further investigate the market reactions for  1  larger and more interconnected financial institutions  and  2  the big 6 banks to evaluate the markets  assessment about the effectiveness of the act in ending the too big to fail policy  we document that larger and more interconnected financial institutions experienced more negative abnormal stock returns and more positive abnormal bond returns as compared to other banks in our sample  but these relations are not present during the final phase of the passage  likewise  we find that both shareholders and bondholders of the big 6 banks initially experienced significant negative returns  followed by insignificant returns during the final phase of the passage  these results appear to suggest the markets are doubtful about the effectiveness of the final version of the bill to end the too big to fail status in particular for the big 6 banks   c  2016 elsevier b v  all rights reserved

 capturing the dynamics of the sharing economy  institutional research on the plural forms and practices of sharing economy organizations to date  management research has paid little attention to dynamics of the sharing economy  how markets for sharing resources emerge and change  and the intended and unintended consequences of resource sharing  we propose a definition of the sharing economy that brings the role of organizations as infrastructure providers to the fore and helps us to assess the culturally rooted pluralism of forms and practices in these organizations  we introduce two perspectives in research on organizational institutionalism that focus on culture and pluralism institutional complexity and institutional work and argue that unpacking the pluralism of organizational forms and practices is critical to examine the dynamics of the sharing economy  we propose an agenda for research to capture the dynamics of the sharing economy at the organizational  field  and inter field level  such an agenda helps to document and analyze how the sharing economy manifests and evolves across various economic systems and has the potential to refine and recast existing management theory  
 capturing the value premium   global evidence from a fair value based investment strategy this paper examines the risk premium of value stocks within a global investment strategy framework  we test whether absolute or relative mispricing is better suited to capturing the global value premium by using fair value based net asset values  navs  as our proxies for fundamental value  we find that investing in the most underpriced stocks relative to the average ratio of price to fundamental value in a country is the key to achieving superior risk adjusted returns  the annualized excess return of the global value portfolio sorted according to relative mispricing is 10 0   and remains significant after controlling for common risk factors   c  2017 published by elsevier b v  
 carry trade strategies based on option implied information  evidence from a cross section of funding currencies we document carry trade returns based on the moments extracted from options on the underlying currencies  we establish three important results  first  a currency pair is predicted to have greater excess returns if option implied returns are more volatile  are more left skewed  and have fatter tails than the returns of other currency pairs  second  strategies based on option implied information improve on benchmark strategies based on realized market returns and macroeconomic data  third  if the option implied returns of a currency pair are more left skewed than in the past  anti carry trades rather than carry trades perform better   c  2017 elsevier ltd  all rights reserved

 cash holdings and labor heterogeneity  the role of skilled labor firms differ in their dependence on skilled labor and face labor adjustment costs that increase with their workers  skill level  we show that firms with a higher share of skilled workers  and thus less flexibility to adjust their labor demand in response to cash flow shocks  hold more precautionary cash  the effect of labor skills on cash holdings is more pronounced for financially constrained firms and varies with exogenous differences in firing and hiring costs  we address endogeneity concerns by using subsamples of firms with reasonably similar characteristics  propensity score matching  and a quasi experimental shock to labor markets  
 cash reserves as a hedge against supply chain risk deregulation of the trucking industry and significantly lowered transportation costs led to large  widespread  and plausibly exogenous reductions in inventory for u s  firms  with consequent increased supply chain disruption  scd  costs  we find evidence that increased scd costs help explain the puzzling long term trend of increasing average u s  firm cash holdings  we also find that firms facing higher expected costs of disruptions generally save more cash from capital freed up via supply chain management innovations  finally  we document significant postdisruption declines in cash holdings consistent with cash as a primary source of financing during disruptions

 categorization and willingness to pay for new products  the role of category cues as value anchors this study focuses on textual category cues and their influence on consumers  willingness to pay for new products  it examines whether an anchoring effect occurs when consumers are provided with textual category cues that refer consumers toward a particular product category  this article argues that consumers  willingness to pay for a product under consideration will tend toward the average price of products in the category in which it is positioned  this average price acts as a reference point that influences consumers  willingness to pay  we hypothesize that the more innovative the product is  the less certain the consumer is about its properties  therefore  the proposed anchoring mechanism will influence consumers  willingness to pay strongly when the product is radically innovative  while the willingness to pay for an incrementally innovative product will not be affected by the proposed anchoring mechanism  our hypotheses are tested by means of four experiments using online auctions in which consumers actually pay when they win an auction  the findings provide support for the role of category cues as semantic anchors  more specifically  giving the cues of categories in which the products had higher average monetary value compared to cues of categories in which the average monetary value was lower  resulted in an increased consumers  willingness to pay for radically new products  as expected  this effect was not found in the case of incrementally new products  the article concludes with theoretical and managerial implications  
 cathedrals of consumption  provincial department stores in england  c 1880 1930 the department store is often seen as a revolutionary force  transforming retail practices  shopping experiences  and the high street  it is variously lauded for its role in the democratization of luxury  the introduction of price ticketing and unfettered browsing  and the creation of a fantasy world of goods  as is so often the case  reality is more complex than the image  especially when we move away from the bright lights of the metropolis and start exploring the high streets of provincial towns  based on a thorough trawl of trade directories  i explore the regional distribution of stores in their 1930s heyday and examine how this distribution developed over time  pushing the discussion back to consider the varied origins of provincial department stores  i then turn to the spatial organization  selling practices  and shopping experience of small samples of stores  questioning the extent to which they formed a monolithic retail type  
 central bank swap lines and cip deviations we study the use of u s  dollar central bank swap lines as a tool for addressing dislocations in the foreign currency swap market against the usd since the global financial crisis  we find that the use of the federal reserve s usd central bank swap lines was mainly related to tensions in u s  money markets during times of financial crisis  and less to tensions that were confined to foreign exchange swap markets  in particular  we find that the use of usd central bank swap lines did not react significantly to the recent period of persistent deviations of covered interest parity since 2014  these results are consistent with the view that the federal reserve was guided by enlightened self interest when providing swap lines to foreign central banks  in order to reduce dislocations in u s  financial markets and support financial stability  in recent years  foreign exchange swap markets have not functioned properly  but it appears that now that the crisis is over  the federal reserve and other central banks have decided against trying permanently to fill the gap left by the dysfunction in the commercial foreign exchange swap market

 charismatic authority and the youtuber  unpacking the new cults of personality in this article  we draw upon weber s concept of charismatic authority to unpack the appeal that youtube video bloggers have galvanized among their fan communities  we explore how followers interact to articulate the appeal of british youtube personalities and consequently  how they contribute to the nature of these new cults of personality   by observing the content of seven of britain s most popular youtubers  and engaging in a sustained non participant netnography of responses to these videos  we argue new cults of personality differ from their traditional counterparts through collaborative  co constructive and communal interdependence between culted figure and follower  while weber maintained charismatic authority has its source in the innate and exceptional qualities of an individual s personality  we submit that in consumer culture s current era of consent  the culting  of social actors becomes a participatory venture  we shed light on the fading and routinization of charisma and the dissipation of the relationship between the culted figure and followers  
 charismatic leadership in it firms in taiwan  an empirical study this study aims to look at charismatic leadership and management innovation in a sample of information technology firms in taiwan  the literature on such leadership was examined because it reveals how leaders serve as key agents who stimulate others with their vision of the potential of an innovation  theoretically  we suggest that charismatic leadership behaviour can help management innovation but only when certain conditions are met  empirically  we find that charismatic leaders must create a higher level of trust in their subordinates at all levels of the organizational hierarchy  based on common perceptions of the firm as a trustworthy entity

 clawback provision adoption  corporate governance  and investment decisions we examine the effect of corporate governance on the likelihood of clawback provision adoption  and its consequences in terms of corporate investment practices and risk taking behavior  we find that firms with strong governance  as proxied by board independence  diligence  and size  are positively associated with the firm s adoption of a clawback provision  whereas firms with weak governance  as proxied by management entrenchment  i e   ceo duality status and tenure  are negatively associated with clawback provision adoption  using the propensity score matching  difference in differences research design  and inverse mills ratio to mitigate omitted variables and self selection biases  we find that after adopting a clawback provision  firms  abnormal investment decreases and the firms  investments are less risky  
 client dependence and vendor innovation  the moderating role of organizational culture with the dramatic increase in technological interconnectedness between firms and the overall speed of technological change  organizations depend on each other to survive and stay competitive  while it is generally believed that dyads and networks can offer advantages over internal development in the innovation process  the authors suggest that it is not necessarily the case  using a sample of 120 vendor firms that work in information technology industries in the indian subcontinent  they find that client dependence in the inter organizational relationship decreases vendor innovation  to resolve this dark side of business relationships  they further examine how the organizational culture can impact the dependence innovation relationship  in line with organization literature  the authors distinguish two sub dimensions of outcome oriented culture  performance orientation  which reflects a firm s internal focus on employee performance  and competitiveness  which reflects a firm s focus on external competitors and markets  it is found that a vendor s competitiveness facilitates innovation  and that it weakens the negative effect of client dependence on vendor innovation  however  performance orientation strengthens the negative effect of client dependence on vendor innovation  accordingly  in order to prevent themselves from falling into the dependence trap in the innovation process  firms need to build an externally oriented competitive culture and avoid overemphasizing their internal performance  
 climate change and sustainability in the energy sector concern with climate change and sustainability emerged in the public debate in the 1970s  over the course of the next 40 years progress was achieved on both fronts  reflecting an evolution in societal values  where economic development was no longer seen as an absolute goal  but one which had to be realized with due regard to its impacts on people and the environment  governments started to consider means to achieve a balance between these competing goals  while companies started to integrate social and environmental considerations in their business pursuits  this article will describe the origins of the concept of sustainability and international attention to climate change and how changes in societal perceptions regarding climate change and societal expectations of company conduct led to increased action by governments and business alike  it will also show how stakeholder activism on the part of the investor community  ngos and governments coupled with companies  endorsement of sustainability as a means to maintain their social licence to operate and hence market position  have resulted in an energy sector prepared to play a part in the transition to a low carbon society  
 co margin we present comargin  a new methodology to estimate collateral requirements in derivatives central counterparties  ccps   comargin depends on both the tail risk of a given market participant and its interdependence with other participants  our approach internalizes trading externalities and enhances the stability of ccps  thus reducing systemic risk concerns  we assess our methodology using proprietary data from the canadian derivatives clearing corporation that include daily observations of the actual trading positions of all of its members from 2003 to 2011  we show that comargin outperforms existing margining systems by stabilizing the probability and minimizing the shortfall of simultaneous margin exceeding losses  
 coexisting agency and stewardship governance in family firms  an empirical investigation of individual level and firm level effects this article theoretically and empirically intertwines agency and stewardship theories to examine their distinct and combined influences on family firms  primary matched triadic data from ceos  family employees  and nonfamily employees in 77 family firms suggest that agency and stewardship governance affects individual level behavior and firm level performance  specifically  agent behavior is highest under conditions of coexisting low agency governance and high stewardship governance and is lowest when agency and stewardship governance coexist at high levels  furthermore  when high levels of agency and stewardship governance coexist  family firm performance is the highest  theoretical implications and future research directions are discussed  
 cognitive biases in investors  behaviour under stress  evidence from the london stock exchange the paper examines the implications arising from the effect of two cognitive biases  representativeness and conservatism  for securities price behaviour on the london stock exchange  in a single  and multi factor framework of abnormal returns  the aspects of trend and consistency in the performance ratios of uk companies are examined on the base of behavioural finance theories with respect to cognitive biases  the findings obtained by the multi factor model confirm the existence of two cognitive biases and trends that investors observe in financial performance over the long term horizon  which is not the case for the single  factor model   c  2017 elsevier inc  all rights reserved  
 collaborating for innovation  the socialised management of knowledge although the importance of diverse knowledge is widely recognised for open innovation  there may be a gap in our understanding of the social processes that shape how collaborators engage in knowledge exchange  this social gap may be significant because of the powerful  but largely unexplained  role attributed to trust as a social artefact  moreover  we see trust as a process and that different types of trust are involved in the collaborative process  thus  this paper uses a qualitative methodology to capture the experiences of innovation collaborators  as explanation of the dynamic interplays of knowledge and trust  we offer a description of phases in the process  our analysis finds that the relationship moves from transactional to social  the early phases are characterised by technical knowledge  but the later and mature phases are identified with knowledge of the person and by personal trust  the success of innovation is a result of relationships with augmented trust  we found that a fabric of trust is woven from the weft of professional knowledge and the warp of personal knowledge to support innovation  we propose that this developing of relationships might be conceived as becoming more open in the sense of sharing with one another  if so  we seem to have described and offered a social dimension of open innovation  
 collaborative agency in educational management  a joint object for school and community transformation this research paper discusses activities developed in a school located in a favela in the city of sao paulo  brazil  and its surrounding community to deal with the issue of flooding  first  i present a review of the literature on educational management suggesting an expansive learning perspective  then i introduce the notion of collaborative agency as theoretical background  methodologically  this study focuses on critical collaborative research and formative intervention  which implies different subjects taking part and negotiating decisions to be made during the research beyond school settings  the analysis is based on categories of description and argumentation  which contribute to the scrutiny of different voices and activities in the respective school and community  thus  i discuss how collaborative agency contributes to the transformation of the given context  first  how the community becomes involved in the activities of the school  and second  how the school is involved in the activities of the community to overcome the problem of flooding  
 collateral constraints and macroeconomic asymmetries full information methods are used to estimate a nonlinear general equilibrium model where occasionally binding collateral constraints on housing wealth drive an asymmetry in the link between housing prices and economic activity  the estimated model shows that  as collateral constraints became slack during the housing boom of 2001 2006  expanding housing wealth made a small contribution to consumption growth  by contrast  the housing collapse that followed tightened the constraints and sharply exacerbated the recession of 2007 2009  the empirical relevance of this asymmetry is corroborated by evidence from state  and msa level data   c  2017 published by elsevier b v  
 collateral damage from the show  emotional labor and unethical behavior we extend the behavioral ethics literature to examining emotional labor as an antecedent to unethical behavior  we hypothesize that surface acting is positively associated with unethical behavior  in contrast  we produce competing hypotheses for the relationship between deep acting and unethical behavior  in study 1  with a field sample of 123 full time employees  surface acting was positively associated with unethical behavior  and emotional inauthenticity explained some of this relationship  in contrast  deep acting was not associated with unethical behavior  in study 2  with a field sample of 117 full time employees  we replicated the effect of surface acting in study 1 and found a positive relationship between deep acting and unethical behavior via emotional inauthenticity  in study 3  using a two wave design  we replicated the results in study 2 and found perceived fairness strengthens the relationship between surface acting and unethical behavior through emotional inauthenticity  
 combining valuable inventions  exploring the impact of prior invention value on the performance of subsequent inventions innovation research widely acknowledges that most inventions are recombinations of existing ideas and technologies  following this stream of research  this study analyses how the values of prior inventions used to develop a subsequent invention influence the value of the new invention  building on evolutionary theory and research on technological search and technological paradigms  this article proposes a positive relationship between prior inventions  value and subsequent invention value  the analysis of a large scale patent data set of pharmaceutical and semiconductor firms largely confirms this notion  however  it also shows that the effect weakens when prior inventions are of  higher  value  valuable prior inventions are also positively related to the likelihood that subsequent inventions are  breakthroughs   however  while this effect also decreases when prior inventions hold higher values  the decreasing effect occurs only at particularly high levels of prior invention value  in contrast  combining valuable inventions limits the likelihood of generating poor invention outcomes value  in summary  while the results lend support to theories of evolutionary and cumulative technological progress  they also show that despite the recombination potential of technical knowledge  there are practical limits to the benefits of valuable inputs  
 communicating corporate social responsibility  csr   stakeholder responsiveness and engagement strategy to achieve csr goals in this current study  we compared two contemporary csr communication strategies  engagement vs  responsiveness   along with communication channels  in achieving csr goals  we conducted an online survey with public relations  corporate communication  corporate social responsibility  investor relations and sustainability executives within the companies listed on the wilshire 5000 total market index of publicly traded u s  companies  results showed that csr engagement strategy had a positive effect on achieving all three csr goals we identified through factor analysis  business  community  and employees  the responsiveness strategy was positively associated with only business and community goal achievement  these findings lend support for the testimonials from industry csr reports regarding the benefits of the engagement approach in achieving intended organizational goals  including attracting and retaining talented employees  in analyzing the impact of communication channels on goal achievement  we found that print ads played a significant role in achieving business goals

 community characteristics and changes in toxic chemical releases  does information disclosure affect environmental injustice  it is well known that environmental burdens are more pronounced in socioeconomically disadvantaged communities  a phenomenon known as environmental injustice  yet  there have been few studies that have addressed whether the degree of environmental injustice has changed over time  we analyze toxic releases in the united states over the first 26 years of the toxics release inventory and examine whether the decreases in toxic releases differ according to characteristics of the communities in which the emitters reside  we find that decreases over these years are universal but far more substantial in high income areas  our results speak to both the nascent literature on information disclosure and that on environmental justice  
 company responses to exchange queries in real time we examine the efficacy of exchange queries in assisting to explain anomalous trading behaviour in a timely manner  using intraday data for a sample of liquid stocks  we find consistent price reversals after firms respond to the query by labelling the pre announcement trading activity as unsubstantiated  the information contained in this unanticipated announcement is impounded within 20 minutes  preceded by a transition period of heightened trading intensity  wider spreads and shifting order book depth  overall  this study finds that queries enhance the orderly flow of information and reduce information asymmetry  exchanges in other countries should consider their use   c  2016 elsevier b v  all rights reserved  
 comparative advertisements and schadenfreude  when and why others  unfortunate choices make us happy comparative advertisements often feature situations depicting consumers who use competitors  brands being subjected to misfortunes  we examine schadenfreude  the pleasure derived from the misfortunes of others  as an affective response elicited by comparative ads  as well as consumers  beliefs in tempting fate as a heretofore unexamined influence thereof  consistent with our theory  we show that comparative ads depicting the misfortunes involving lower quality  vs  higher quality  competitors elicit greater schadenfreude  and that this is because choosing the former is perceived to tempt fate and to be more deserving of misfortune than the latter  moreover  heightened levels of schadenfreude in turn lead to more positive attitudes and increased purchase intentions among consumers who are more  vs  less  reluctant to tempt fate  
 comparative statics and portfolio choices under the phantom decision model this study characterizes attitudes toward uncertainty in the phantom decision model introduced by lzhakian and lzhakian  2015  and conducts a comparative statics analysis to examine how changes in phantom uncertainty and phantom aversion affect portfolio choices  first   phantom averse  and  more phantom  averse  are defined in a manner that differs from lzhakian and lzhakian  2015   assuming that utility functions have realization forms  the above notions are characterized by the shapes of their reduction components  for the portfolio choice problem that consists of one safe asset and one phantom asset  we derive sufficient conditions under which changes in phantom uncertainty and phantom aversion monotonically decrease the investment in the phantom asset  some familiar concepts in expected utility theory are extended to the framework of the phantom decision model   c  2017 elsevier b v  all rights reserved  
 comparisons of hospital output in canada  national and international perspectives current cost based approach in measuring health care output does not allow decomposition of health care expenditure into price and output components  in this paper we propose an episode based direction measurement method which closely resembles the concept of output in the system of national accounts  using data from the canadian institute for health information  we calculate a quality unadjusted output index of the canadian hospital sector for the periods 1996 2005  the result shows that total output increases at an average annual growth rate of 1 49   we expect that with the quality adjustment the actual rate is higher  this is in contrast with the long held assumption that health care productivity growth is zero  our results provide key information on the ongoing health care policy debate  
 compensation revisited  a social resource theory perspective on offering a monetary resource after a service failure this research examines how to recompense customers  from a social resource theory perspective  which portrays financial compensation as the act of offering the resource  money  to customers during a service recovery attempt  this resource can differ in its particularism  is the money offered in a more or less personal way   and concreteness  is the money offered in a more or less tangible way    which are shown in two experiments to affect recovery outcomes  specifically  personal compensation accompanied by a handwritten note from the service person  vs  impersonal  a typewritten note from the firm  fosters recovery satisfaction  mediated by justice perceptions  and reciprocal customer behavior  tipping  cross buying   mediated by an obligation to reciprocate  tangible compensation in the form of a banknote or banknote like coupon  vs  intangible  a credit entry  also fosters reciprocal customer behavior via the obligation to reciprocate  in both studies  relationship strength amplifies the indirect effect of compensation s particularism on recovery satisfaction  as a theoretical contribution  we show that the way the monetary resource is presented matters for service recovery  as a major managerial takeaway  this research presents personal  vs  impersonal  compensation as an impactful property of compensation  it increases recovery outcomes without additional monetary costs  further  managers learn that handing over the money in a personal and tangible way can be a way to increase monetary returns to the firm in the form of tipping and cross buying  
 competition of a different flavor  how a strategic group identity shapes competition and cooperation using an inductive study of 41 gourmet food trucks  we develop theory about how firms form a strategic group identity that shapes both competitive and cooperative behaviors among its members  based on an analysis of group prototypes  we find that members cooperate to help each other meet the central tendencies of the group the properties that typical group members have and yet compete to strive for the ideal tendencies of the group the attributes of members held in highest regard  these competitive and cooperative dynamics lead to three surprising consequences in light of previous research on strategic groups   1  existing members of the strategic group help new firms enter the market   2  resource scarcity leads to cooperation  not competition  and  3  when competition does emerge  it focuses on status within the group and not on price  to make sense of these empirical puzzles  we develop theory around the micro identity processes that allow a strategic group s identity to persist and to shape its member firms  behaviors  which alters how scholars understand the inner workings of strategic groups and their impact on both firms and markets  
 complementarities in innovation strategy  do intangibles play a role in enhancing firm performance  this article assesses the role of investments in intangible capital and their potential complementarities as a way to improve firm productivity  we focus on the three intangible resources that  according to the literature  have the greatest strategic importance  research and development  r d   advertising  and human capital  to test our hypotheses  we use a large sample of spanish manufacturing firms and consider estimates of total factor productivity through a generalized method of moments approach  our results show evidence of complementarities between r d and advertising investments and between advertising and human capital  however  they are not conclusive in the case of r d and human capital  
 conference call tone and stock returns  evidence from the stock exchange of hong kong we investigate market reactions to manager and analyst tones during earnings conference calls using company transcripts from the stock exchange of hong kong  sehk   this is the first study to examine the role of conference call tones outside of a us setting  consistent with previous us based results  we find that positive tones lead to higher stock returns  in contrast to us based results  we show that investors place more emphasis on managerial tones than on analyst tones  we also find that stock market reactions to conference call tones are stronger for firms with a sophisticated investor base  
 configurations of innovations across domains  an organizational ambidexterity view how do firms balance explorative and exploitative innovation for superior firm performance  while most prior studies have approached this issue by focusing on technology related innovation  the role of balancing exploration and exploitation in other important organizational domains  i e   marketing  and the interaction effect of ambidexterity across different domains have been overlooked  this study contributes to this line of research by investigating how firms simultaneously balance exploration and exploitation across two critical domains  namely technology innovation and market innovation  the study distinguishes four types of configurations  market leveraging  technology exploration and market exploitation   technology leveraging  technology exploitation and market exploration   pure exploitation  technology exploitation and market exploitation   and pure exploration  technology exploration and market exploration   from an organizational ambidexterity perspective  the current work investigates whether and how these different combinations exert distinctive effects on firm performance  specifically  the article posits that  a  technology exploration and market exploitation complement each other  and  b  technology exploitation and market exploration also complement each other  such that both market leveraging and technology leveraging strategies have positive effects on firm performance  the article also maintains that such positive relationships are fully mediated by differentiation and low cost advantages  conversely  it is argued that  c  technology exploration and market exploration conflict with each other  and  d  so do technology exploitation and market exploitation  such that both pure exploration and pure exploitation have negative effects on firm performance  hypotheses were tested using survey data collected from 292 manufacturing and service firms in china  the results supported most of the hypotheses  except that pure exploration demonstrated no significant relationship with firm performance  
 conflict between controlling family owners and minority shareholders  much ado about nothing  we examine the unique nature of conflict between controlling family owners and minority shareholders  principal principal conflict  in publicly traded family controlled firms through examining shareholder proposals  implicit in prior governance and family business research has been that nonfamily shareholders are likely to be in conflict with the dominant family owners  in general  we find that much of this fear may be unwarranted except under specific circumstances  our findings elucidate sources of heterogeneity in family firm principal principal conflict and add greater nuance to our understanding of this type of agency problem within family firms  
 conforming conservatives  how salient social identities can increase donations this research considers how common perceptions of liberals  generosity can be harnessed for increasing donations  given conservatives  greater tendency to conform to group norms than liberals  we theorize that conformity tendencies can increase donations by conservatives when accountable to a liberal audience who share a salient identity  specifically  conservatives donate more when they are accountable to a liberal audience with whom they have a salient shared identity  study 1  due to their motivation for social approval  studies 3 and 4   however  if the donation context activates political identity  studies 2 and 3  or if the unifying social identity is not salient  study 4   accountability does not impact donation decisions  notably  liberals do not alter their behavior  ruling out alternative explanations for the pattern of conformity  this research provides insight into the distinct role of accountability for conservatives and importance of audience characteristics for conformity  though both liberals and conservatives can be generous  this research demonstrates how conformity can be used to increase charitable giving among conservatives   c  2017 society for consumer psychology  published by elsevier inc  all rights reserved

 consumer default  credit reporting  and borrowing constraints why do negative credit events lead to long term borrowing constraints  exploiting banking regulations in peru and utilizing currency movements  we show that consumers who face a credit rating downgrade due to bad luck experience a three year reduction in financing  consumers respond to the shock by paying down their most troubled loans  but nonetheless end up more likely to exit the credit market  for a set of borrowers who experience severe delinquency  we find that the associated credit reporting downgrade itself accounts for 25  to 65  of their observed decline in borrowing at various horizons over the following several years  
 consumer reliance on intangible versus tangible attributes in service evaluation  the role of construal level the services marketing literature has traditionally characterized intangibility as the most critical distinction between services and goods  but in practice service production and consumption often involve both intangible and tangible elements  while prior research has examined and debated service intangibility from the firm s perspective  what is missing is an understanding of how consumers weigh the relative importance of intangible versus tangible attributes in their service evaluation  drawing on construal level theory  the authors propose that consumers with a high  vs  low  construal level rely more on intangible  vs  tangible  attributes in service evaluation  furthermore  the effect of construal level on service evaluation is mediated by imagery vividness  with service type  e g   experience vs  credence services  serving as a boundary condition  the authors conduct two field studies and two lab experiments and find that under a high construal level  consumers rely more on intangible attributes in their service evaluation and choice formation  under a low construal level  consumers rely more on tangible attributes in their service evaluation and choice  the findings not only offer new insights to help reconcile the disparate perspectives on service intangibility in the literature but also have practical implications on service firms  positioning strategies that vary across time  e g   advance selling vs  on site selling  and space  e g   near vs  distant outlet   as well as which attributes to emphasize in their marketing communications  
 consumer responses to functional  aesthetic and symbolic product design in online reviews this research addresses calls to consider consumer responses to product design along three dimensions  functional  aesthetic  and symbolic design  based on an analysis of online consumer reviews  this research sheds light on the role of all three design dimensions and reveals how each uniquely contributes to consumers  behavioral responses directly and indirectly though emotional arousal a key mediator  furthermore  an important distinction rooted in consumer information processing models is made between low involvement and high involvement products  the results indicate that the effectiveness of each of the three design dimensions differs depending on the level of product involvement  taken together  the research findings highlight the importance of taking all three design dimensions into account  including the symbolic design dimension  which has received relatively little attention to date  
 consumer search of multiple information sources and its impact on consumer price satisfaction when making important purchase decisions  consumers often consult multiple information sources  this paper exanines how consumers allocate their search time across offline and internet sources using survey data from new automobile purchases  our analysis shows how time spent on internet sources interrelates with time spent on offline sources  such as car dealerships  and vice versa  furthermore  we examine whether longer search times imply higher price satisfaction as an outcome of search  a simultaneous equations tobit model with latent classes is used  analysis of a decade of survey data reveals two automobile purchaser segments of which the larger one accounts for 91  of observations  based on this  we find that  1  specific website types can complement or substitute for offline information sources and for each other and  2  longer search times result in increased price satisfaction but only on specific information sources  our findings provide automobile manufacturers and dealers an insightful way to utilize and manage different sources for product and price information provision   c  2017 direct marketing educational foundation  inc  dba marketing edge  all rights reserved

 corporate environmental policy and shareholder value  following the smart money we examine the value consequences of corporate social responsibility through the lens of institutional shareholders  we find a sharp asymmetry between corporate policies that mitigate the firm s exposure to environmental risk and those that enhance its perceived environmental friendliness   greenness    institutional investors shun stocks with high environmental risk exposure  which we show have lower valuations  as predicted by risk management theory  these findings suggest that corporate environmental policies that mitigate environmental risk exposure create shareholder value  in contrast  firms that increase greenness do not create shareholder value and are also shunned by institutional investors

 corporate governance indices and construct validity manuscript typeconceptual and empirical  research question issuemany studies of firm level corporate governance rely on aggregate indices to measure underlying  unobserved governance  but we are not confident that we know how to build these indices  often we are unsure both as to what is good governance  and how one can proxy for this vague concept using observable measures  we conduct an exploratory analysis of how researchers can address the construct validity of firm level governance indices  which poses a major challenge to all studies that rely on these indices  research findings insightswe assess the construct validity of governance indices for four major emerging markets  brazil  india  korea  and turkey   developed in prior work  in that work  we built country specific indices  using country specific governance elements that reflect local norms  institutions  and data availability  and showed that these indices predict firm market value in each country  the use of country specific indices puts great stress on the construct validity challenge of assessing how well a governance measure matches the underlying concept  we address here how well these four country specific indices  and subindices for aspects of governance such as board structure or disclosure  coherently measure unobserved  underlying actual governance  theoretical academic implicationswe provide guidance on how researchers can address the construct validity of corporate governance indices  practitioner policy implicationsthe uncertain construct validity of most corporate governance indices suggests caution in relying on research using these indices as a basis for firm level governance changes  or country level legal reforms  
 corporate governance structure and efficiencies of cooperative banks how to discipline managers of cooperative structured financial institutions  co ops  is considered a critical issue by the japanese financial regulatory authorities because co ops play a significant role in the domestic banking market  especially for small and medium sized enterprises  this paper seeks to clarify whether the effect of the governance related variables on firm performance varies across stock and cooperative banks in japan  we consider regional banks as a proxy of stock banks and shinkin banks  one of the representative co ops  as a proxy of cooperative banks  we use cost and profit efficiency scores obtained from stochastic frontier analysis as performance measures  the results in this paper confirmed that having a large number of board members has negative effects on efficiency measures for both stock and cooperative banks  on the other hand  the presence of outside directors has a significant effect on efficiency measures for cooperative banks  whereas such variables have no significant effect for stock banks  these results suggest that outside directors  discipline is more necessary for cooperative banks than for stock banks  which are under strong pressure from shareholders  for cooperative banks  a high ratio of representative council members  which is the most important decision making body for shinkin banks  has negative effects on efficiency measures  our findings support the current proposals of the financial regulatory authorities  council to appoint outside directors to the board as a means for strengthening governance of the co ops  
 corporate lobbying and labor relations  evidence from employee level litigations in this study  we analyze employee litigation and other work related complaints to examine if the judicial process favors firms that engage in lobbying  we gather data for 27 794 employee lawsuits  after their initial court hearings  filed between 2000 and 2014 and test the relationship between employee allegations and firms  lobbying strategies  we find that employee litigation increases the number of labor related bills in our sample  we document that an increase in employee lawsuits may drive firms into lobbying to change policy proposals  we also find robust evidence that case outcomes are different for lobbying firms compared to non lobbying rivals  which may protect shareholder wealth in the long run  our results suggest lobbying activities may make a significant difference in the effects of employee lawsuits  our findings highlight the benefit of building political capital to obtain biased outcomes in favor of politically connected firms   c  2017 elsevier b v  all rights reserved

 corporate social responsibility and governance  information disclosure in multinational corporations multinational corporations  mncs  are facing increasing pressure on two fronts   the demand for more transparency and disclosure and the need to implement good corporate governance practices  this paper develops several testable hypotheses that address these issues based on agency theory and stakeholder management approach arguments  as such  the relationship between corporate social responsibility  csr  programs and firm level governance structures are discussed  csr is measured using transparency international s study on the disclosure practices of the world s largest mncs  links between board size  board independence  and duality are explored  the results indicate that board independence and board size are strongly and positively related to several csr practices  in addition  extractive industries have a significant and positive impact on the level of csr activities  policy and managerial implications related to these findings are also discussed  copyright  c  2017 john wiley   sons  ltd and erp environment 
 corporate social responsibility and shareholder proposals we study how corporate social responsibility relates to investors  firms  and shareholder proposals  we examine shareholder proposals on environmental  social  and governance issues at the annual general meeting of shareholders with us fortune 250 firms during 2011 2014  we find that the probability of receiving shareholder proposals on environmental issues is positively associated with responsible institutional ownership  we find no systematic evidence that the outperformance regarding social responsibility of the firms themselves would significantly matter regarding the likelihood of shareholders filing proposals about corporate social responsibility  except for employee wellbeing  copyright  c  2017 john wiley   sons  ltd and erp environment 
 corporate social responsibility and the assessment by auditors of the risk of material misstatement this paper investigates whether  and how  firms  corporate social responsibility  csr  performance influences the auditor s assessment of the risk of material misstatement  whether due to fraud or error  at the financial statement level by analysing their pricing decision  i e   audit fees   using a panel data set of 12 330 firms from 28 countries over the period 2003 2012 and different measures of csr performance  we find a u shaped relationship between firms  csr performance and audit fees  this result suggests that there is an optimal level of csr performance that minimizes the auditor s assessment of the risk of material misstatement  which in turn lowers the need for greater auditor effort  that is why auditors charge firms significantly less when their csr performance is at the optimal level  finally  we also show that the optimal level of csr performance varies with the degree of environmental dynamism  ownership concentration and leverage  
 corporate social responsibility and women s entrepreneurship  towards a more adequate theory of  work  programs aimed at increasing women s entrepreneurship are a rapidly proliferating class of csr initiatives across the globe with participation by many of the world s largest corporations  the gendered nature of this phenomenon suggests that feminist approaches to csr may offer a particularly salient mode of their analysis  in this article  i argue that insights from feminist economics regarding the historically prevalentbut narrow and gendereddefinition of work  which artificially separates production from reproduction  provide fruitful tools for theory building when conceptualizing gender through the lens of csr  i demonstrate that the gendered separation of production and reproduction is typically taken as given in entrepreneurship  and that mainstream csr research has not sufficiently challenged this perspective  i present a conceptual framework of what is to be gained by examining the csr  entrepreneurship  and feminist economics literatures in combination  and demonstrate how researchers might use this framework for future research  
 corporate social responsibility as a legitimacy maintenance strategy in the professional accountancy firm this paper investigates how accountancy firms use corporate social responsibility  csr  as a device to maintain legitimacy with key constituents  it explores who these constituents  audiences  are for their csr actions and the strategies they use to maintain legitimacy with these audiences  interview based evidence from 18 large accountancy firms in the united kingdom  uk  identifies the main csr constituents as  clients and potential clients of the firm  graduates as potential entrants to the industry  internal audiences represented by the firms  staff and partners  and other external audiences constructed as members of those local communities in which the firm operate  in the largest firms  maintaining pragmatic legitimacy with some client  graduate and internal audiences is frequently dependent on the development of moral legitimacy established with other external constituents  communities   consequently  the typologies of legitimacy developed are largely pragmatic  the most ephemeral and most easily attained form  rather than something that is enduring  embedded and taken for granted   c  2017 elsevier ltd  all rights reserved  
 corporate social responsibility engagement as a determinant of bank reputation  an empirical analysis the relationships between sustainable behavior  firm reputation  and economic performance are significant issues that continue to become more important  corporate reputation has important implications for economic performance while corporate social responsibility engagement is considered a key determinant of reputation  the aim of this study is to empirically test such relationships regarding the banking sector and for the sub prime crisis period  2008 2012   we apply our hypothesis to 75 large international banks using reputation institute and asset4 data and adopting a multiple econometric approach  our initial results are encouraging and consistent with the existing literature  bank reputation is positively related to accounting performance and is negatively related to leverage and riskiness profiles  however  while a positive relationship between reputation and social performance exists  relationships between reputation  corporate governance  and environmental performance are always negative  we discuss these results by identifying related causes and by presenting avenues for future research  copyright  c  2017 john wiley   sons  ltd and erp environment 
 corporate social responsibility in supply chains of small and medium sized enterprises research has shown that implementation of corporate social responsibility  csr  practice represents a considerable challenge for small and medium sized enterprises  smes   this research conceptualises the dimensions and contingencies of csr in sme supply chains  drawing on institutional theory and stakeholder theory  we investigated the degree of importance and implementation of csr practices in smes  a large scale questionnaire survey with smes in manufacturing sectors and panel discussions were conducted in south korea  the findings indicate that smes tend to focus on explicit csr practices that can be easily identified by their customers  consistent with this  stakeholder and institutional pressures were valid in the performance of csr practices  but largely biased to customers  government  and regulatory pressures  based on institutional theory and stakeholder theory as overarching theoretical lenses  this research contributes to a fuller understanding of the dimensions of csr practices in the supply chains from an sme perspective  copyright  c  2017 john wiley   sons  ltd and erp environment 
 corporate social responsibility reporting and varieties of capitalism  an international analysis of state led and liberal market economies different studies carried out to date in the corporate social responsibility  csr  field have focused on analysing certain explanatory factors of csr reporting in different countries or individual factors  such as firm size  activity sector  good corporate governance  economic and financial profitability  and the cost of equity capital  among others  in contrast  other aspects of national cultures and institutions that make up the macroeconomic  legal  and political context of a country have been addressed to a lesser extent  this paper analyses how aspects of national institutions affect csr reporting on an international level using the varieties of the capitalism approach  this approach is concerned with companies and the ways in which they interact strategically to solve the coordination problems that arise from their activities  the study uses data from the thomson reuters eikon database and the global reporting initiative  g3 1  for a sample of firms from countries classified as state led market economies  france  portugal  and spain  and countries considered liberal market economies  the usa and the uk   the results obtained by linear regression show those companies in state led market economies disclose more concerning csr than companies in liberal market economies  moreover  firms in state led market economies disclose more on stakeholder aspects such as social  environmental and business behaviour than companies in liberal market economies  this may be due to coercive pressure  that is  the existence of a significant and well developed legal system that seeks to protect stakeholders and is not exclusively oriented towards shareholder interests  copyright  c  2017 john wiley   sons  ltd and erp environment 
 corporate sustainability  toward a theoretical integration of catholic social teaching and the natural resource based view of the firm even though management scholars have offered several views on the process of corporate sustainability  these efforts have focused mainly on the technical aspects of sustainability while omitting the fundamental role played by individual moral competences  therefore  previous work offers an incomplete and somewhat reductionist view of corporate sustainability  in this article  we develop a holistic framework of corporate sustainability in which both the moral and technical aspects of sustainability are considered  we do so by integrating the ethical  normative perspective of the catholic social teaching  cst  with the competitive view of the natural resource based view  this framework highlights the importance of cst principles and ideas in developing executive moral competences such as moral sensitivity and awareness  and moral cognition and motivation  moral competences  in turn  influence the organizational selection of environmental strategies  giving leaders the intrinsic motivation to promote both a longer term stance on corporate sustainability efforts and a relentless search for greener business models  such strategies move the firm closer towards achieving environmental sustainability  hence  by bridging the individual  normative ethical with the organizational  implementational levels of corporate sustainability  our framework provides a more realistic  coherent  and complete perspective on the complex process of achieving corporate sustainability  
 corporate volunteering climate  mobilizing employee passion for societal causes and inspiring future charitable action today s corporations are increasingly engaging in efforts to address societal concerns ranging from hunger and poverty to education and financial stability  predominantly through corporate volunteering  yet  because research has been focused on the individual volunteer we still know relatively little about how corporate volunteering can help address grand challenges  in this study  we introduce the concept of  corporate volunteering climate  in order to examine the broader  more system level functioning of corporate volunteering in workplaces  drawing on the sense making process  we theorize about how this climate develops to what extent is it driven by company level policies versus employee convictions for a cause  we also explore the potential influence of corporate volunteering climate for volunteers and non volunteers  in terms of the workplace  through employee affective commitment  and the community  through employee intentions to volunteer  whether through corporate opportunities or personally   the results of a study conducted with united way worldwide suggest that corporate volunteering climate arises through both employee belief in the cause and corporate policies  and that these forces act as substitutes for each other  moreover  by fostering a sense of collective pride among employees  this climate is related to affective commitment  and corporate and personal volunteering intentions  
 cost of sovereign debt and foreign bias in bond allocations finance theory suggests that markets where foreign bond portfolio investors overweight their portfolio relative to the prescribed theoretical benchmark should experience higher international risk sharing  correspondingly  the cost of debt in such markets should be lower compared to markets facing a lower degree of international risk sharing  we empirically examine this prediction using a panel data set of sovereign bond yield spreads and a measure of suboptimal foreign bond portfolio allocations for 50 emerging and ten developed markets  consistent with theory  our results show higher levels of foreign bond allocations   relative to the theoretical benchmark   are negatively related to the cost of debt  these results have important policy implications as a country s cost of debt could potentially be lowered by encouraging foreign portfolio investors to hold their optimal allocation   c  2017 elsevier b v  all rights reserved  
 cost benefit analysis of leaning against the wind an obvious cost of  leaning against the wind  is a weaker economy if no  financial  crisis occurs  possible benefits are lower probabilities and smaller magnitudes of crises  a second cost less obvious  previously overlooked  but higher is a weaker economy if a crisis occurs  for representative estimates  costs exceed benefits by substantial margins  overturning the result requires policy rate effects on the probability and magnitude of crises more than 5 40 standard errors larger than representative estimates  higher probabilities  larger magnitudes  or longer durations of crises typical consequences of ineffective macro prudential policy increase the margin of costs over benefits  c  2017 elsevier b v  all rights reserved

 creditor control and product market competition we explore how rival firms respond when firms in their industry violate debt covenants  we find that rival firms increase advertising expense  and that this increase is proportional to the size of industry violators  pre existing market share  rival firm product market share also increases in the industry market share of violators  and this relation is more pronounced when products are more substitutable  rival firm operating performance also increases in proportion to the industry market share of violators  overall  these findings suggest that the increased creditor control associated with covenant violations has a significant influence on rival firms and product market competition   c  2017 elsevier b v  all rights reserved  
 crisis sentiment in the us insurance sector we use internet search volume data to measure idiosyncratic and market wide crisis sentiment to explain insurer stock return volatility  we find that market level crisis sentiment was a significant predictor of stock return volatility of u s  insurers between 2006 and 2010  higher levels of crisis sentiment are associated with higher levels of price uncertainty  this effect is strongest for insurers with less exposure to the adverse effects of the financial crisis  further  crisis sentiment also affects the cross section of movements in insurer stock prices  our results imply that investors exited insurer stocks mainly due to crisis sentiment rather than a rational assessment of the insurers  actual exposure to the crisis

 customer and selling orientations of retail salespeople and the sales manager s ability to perceive emotions  a multi level approach drawing from the mental ability framework and information processing theory  two studies embedded within the b2c retail setting investigate the role of the sales manager s ability to perceive emotions in the complex nonlinear relationships between salespeople s customer and selling orientations on one side  and its outcomes  sales performance and customer re purchase intention  on the other  using multilevel data from salespeople and their managers  study 1 tests a theoretical model of salesperson orientation and performance  while study 2 further verifies the results of study 1 from the customer s perspective  both studies find strong empirical support for a curvilinear  inverted u shaped effect of a salesperson s customer orientation on sales performance and customer re purchase intention  this effect is  however  reversed for the link between selling orientation and performance re purchase intention  where results indicate a u shaped curvilinear relationship  furthermore  we show that the sales manager s ability to perceive emotions facilitates the effect of salespeople s customer orientation on sales performance  
 customer benefits and value creation in streaming services marketing  a managerial cognitive capability approach customer value analysis and management is a key theoretical and empirical issue in marketing management and strategic management  however  little is known about the influence of customer benefit on customer value from the microfoundations of the dynamic capabilities perspective  currently  a boom in online video and music streaming services is changing the entertainment industry structure  thus  marketing managers in the fast growing streaming services industry should have dynamic managerial capabilities to anticipate other service elements that customers consider valuable  based on managerial cognitive dynamic capabilities  this research explored the influences of customer perceived functional benefit  experiential benefit  financial benefit  and psychosocial benefit on perceived instrumental and terminal values  general linear model  glm  and fuzzy set qualitative comparative analysis  fsqca  were conducted to gain a more nuanced understanding of how different customers  perceived benefits have different impacts on perceived value  the findings illuminate complex benefit configurations that drive perceived instrumental and terminal values and contribute to the development of value creation and its drivers  the proposed framework can help managers develop managerial cognitive dynamic capabilities by increasing their understanding of the impact of different perceived benefits on value creation for different types of customers  
 customer inspiration  conceptualization  scale development  and validation introducing customers to new ideas lies at the heart of marketing  yet surprisingly little is known about customers  state of inspiration within this domain  this article reviews prior conceptualizations of general inspiration in psychology and introduces the concept of customer inspiration as a customer s temporary motivational state that facilitates the transition from the reception of a marketing induced idea to the intrinsic pursuit of a consumption related goal  the authors develop and validate a two state  ten item customer inspiration scale that consists of inspired by and inspired to states  the scale development process begins with item generation  followed by five studies   1  scale purification and initial validation   2  exploration of the nomological network   3  tests for the experimental and predictive validity   4  replication within a field experiment  and  5  assessments of generalizability and boundary conditions  empirical results reveal sound psychometric properties of the scale  demonstrate its unique position in relation to established marketing constructs  and support experimental and predictive validity  applying the scale in marketing practice offers a new way for firms to increase demand  motivate customers  exploration behavior  and build customer loyalty  
 customer lifetime network value  customer valuation in the context of network effects nowadays customers are increasingly connected and extensively interact with each other using technology enabled media like online social networks  hence  customers are frequently exposed to social influence when making purchase decisions  however  established approaches for customer valuation mostly neglect network effects based on social influence  this leads to a misallocation of resources  following a design oriented approach  this paper develops a model for customer valuation referred to as the customer lifetime network value  clnv  incorporating an integrated network perspective  by considering the customers  net contribution to the network  the clnv reallocates values between customers based on social influence  inspired by common prestige  and eigenvector related centrality measures it incorporates social influence among all degrees of separation acknowledging its viral spread  using a real world dataset  we demonstrate the practicable applicability of the clnv to determine individual customers  value  
 customer participation in services  domain  scope  and boundaries extant service research considers several aspects of customer participation  cp  but lacks a clear and inclusive typology that delineates cp s domain  scope  or boundaries  to address this gap  the authors build on a review of extant literature and propose a typology to classify cp into three categories mandatory  replaceable  and voluntary  they demonstrate how this proposed typology improves the conceptual and empirical clarity of cp research  more specifically  the authors  1  suggest using  customer participation  to replace other terminologies such as coproduction and cocreation to reduce confusion   2  conceptualize cp  customer engagement  and customer innovation as related but distinct concepts   3  use the proposed typology to extend existing conceptualizations  integrate prior empirical research  and reconcile conflicting findings  building on the enhanced conceptual clarity  managerial implications and future research directions are discussed  
 customer stock ownership as monopoly utility political strategy in the 1910s and 1920s in the beginning of the twentieth century  as americans erupted in righteous indignation over the flagrant abuses of monopoly utilities  utility executives responded by developing several strategies to improve public opinion  rein in regulation  and thwart public ownership  one of the most widely used and successful of these strategies was selling gas  electricity  and telephone company stock directly to customers  to reach these local customers  utility managers required their employees to peddle stock directly to their friends  family  and customers  using this method  utilities reached a large number of americans who would not normally have set up a brokerage account or been solicited by a securities sales agent  by farming these interstitial regions of america s financial landscape  utility executives harvested millions of dollars in capital  but as executives explicitly made clear  the goal of customer stock ownership was not to raise capital but to raise political support  by the crash of 1929  utilities directly sold stock to 20 percent of the total number of stockholding americans directly through customer stock ownership programs and not through traditional brokerage firms  this article situates the development of customer stock ownership in the political economic context from which it emerged as an organizational response  reveals the social and organizational processes by which utility monopolies sold stock  and appraises the effect of customer stock ownership on antimonopoly sentiment in america  
 dark side or bright light  destructive and constructive deviant content in consumer ideation contests firms use ideation contests to generate ideas from consumers  this type of collaboration provides access to new knowledge and reveals latent consumer needs  but it also is risky  as firms give up control to an unknown crowd  some contestants use ideation contests to post content that is unintended and unwanted by contest hosts  a behavior that represents deviant co creation  drawing on literature from sociology and consumer research  deviance is defined as a relative  norm violating behavior that has the potential to activate others  we report the results from a netnography study to define the phenomenon of deviant co creation in ideation contests  based on these findings  we provide a theoretical foundation for deviant co creation and conceptualize and empirically illustrate various patterns of deviant content  ranging from destructive to constructive  the study reveals that deviant content in ideation contests includes illegitimate as well as legitimate content  legitimate content includes five themes  humorous  provocative  unique  violation from technical  and social norms  deviant content usually bewilders evaluators and draws their attention to the content  destructive deviant content may trigger visible and malicious protests or result in mocking and ridicule on the contest platform and other social media  thereby exposing the contest host to reputational risks  constructive deviant content can lead to positive discussions in comment sections and other social media outlets  as well as foster further development of an initial idea  thereby contributing to the firm s innovation potential  this article provides managers a deeper understanding of deviant content raising awareness for the dark side risks as well as indicating how to leverage it to achieve constructive co creation

 debt spikes  blind spots  and financial stress are blind spots of public debt spikes sizable  and how do they affect financial stress indicators  this paper tackles these questions empirically  using information from 179 episodes of public debt spikes between 1945 and 2014  we find that large public debt spikes are neither driven by high primary deficits nor by output declines but instead by stock flow adjustments  these blind spots in debt dynamics are sizable in both advanced economies and emerging markets and could amount to more than 20  of gross domestic product in the median episode  these public debt spikes increase financial stress indicators significantly  in particular when a large share of public debt is held by domestic commercial banks  enhanced transparency and better debt forecasting tools could help address financial market tensions resulting from blind spots in debt dynamics  
 decades of eu energy policy  towards politically driven markets looking back over the last 30 years  the european union s energy policy has gone through multiple significant changes  the national monopolies have been broken up and markets have been liberalised  however if we focus on the last 10 years  the picture is very different  trust in the invisible hand of the markets is fading away and governmental control is returning in many areas  looking at natural gas markets and infrastructure investments  this article illustrates the change in the eu s approach from markets and market mechanisms to increasingly intrusive public sector control  not only is the public sector deciding what to invest and where  it is now also moving towards deciding which commercial projects should go forward and which should not  instead of markets being driven by commercial logic  the motivations behind cross  border natural gas projects are often political in nature  this is not in itself uncommon since energy and politics have always been closely connected at global level  however  it conflicts with the eu s policies in this area  which are based on liberal market thinking

 denial outperforms apology in repairing organizational trust despite strong evidence of guilt previous work in the areas of organizational trust repair and crisis communication has provided conflicting answers to the question of whether denial can be more effective than apology in repairing stakeholder trust in a company following an integrity based violation  this article reports the results of an experiment designed to  i  test the effects of these two strategies on individuals  trust in a company accused of corruption  and  ii  determine whether and how evidence of the company s guilt influences stakeholder reactions to its trust repair message  the results demonstrate that  when evidence against the company is weak  trust is restored more successfully with a denial than an apology  contrary to our hypothesis  denial was found to outperform apology in repairing perceptions of the company s integrity and benevolence even in the face of strong evidence  and it was as effective as apology in restoring perceived ability and trusting intentions  these results provide empirical evidence for the  paradoxical effect  that an open and honest attitude can  in the short term  be more detrimental to organizations than a defensive strategy  more research on the factors that determine the credibility and persuasiveness of corporate denial is called for  
 density of skew brownian motion and its functionals with application in finance we derive the joint density of a skew brownian motion  its last visit to the origin  its local and occupation times  the result enables us to obtain explicit analytical formulas for pricing european options under both a two valued local volatility model and a displaced diffusion model with constrained volatility  
 depositor discipline for better or for worse  what enhanced depositors  confidence on the banking system in the last ten years  the aim of this paper is to verify the presence of depositor discipline and how it worked before  during and after the global financial crisis  to that end we build up a model for testing whether depositors do discipline banks considering different degrees and measures of bank risk and changes in the features of deposit insurance schemes  diss   to test our hypotheses  we gathered a sample of banks located in 22 oecd countries covering the period from 2005 to 2014  we found the presence of depositor discipline and also depositors  moral hazard behaviours  the results suggest that depositor discipline worked differently through the periods analysed according to the relevant changes in the economic conditions  moreover  the specific features of diss did not influence depositor discipline before and during the crisis  conversely they have proven to be positively evaluated by depositors in the post crisis period   c  2017 elsevier b v  all rights reserved  
 design and demonstration of an engineering method for service support systems an integrated and simultaneous design that considers products  services  and information systems is essential due to the mutual influences among each of the three components  this is particularly important in technical customer services  tcs   as the engineering process combines complex high tech products with diverse types of services  however  to date no explicit guidance on the integration of information systems into the product service systems engineering process exists  thus  we propose a method to design service support systems simultaneously  for designing the method  a design science research approach was applied  we demonstrated the applicability of our method by designing and implementing a two tier service system in a real world scenario in the domain of tcs  a virtual reality based training system for training purposes along with a smart glasses based support system that guides the service technician at the point of service  by proposing and demonstrating our method  we enhance the body of knowledge in service systems engineering and design of is  the practical contribution is given in additional guidance for designers of new products  services  and is to master complexity and foster information support of technicians  
 designing backcasting scenarios for resilient energy futures the concept of resilience is a crucial part in crafting visions of desirable futures designed to withstand the widest variety of external shocks to the system  backcasting scenarios are widely used to envision desirable futures with a discontinuous change from the present in mind  however  less effort has been devoted to developing theoretical frameworks and methods for building backcasting scenarios with a particular focus on resilience  although resilience has been explored in related sustainability fields  this paper proposes a method that helps design backcasting scenarios for resilient futures  a characteristic of the method is to delineate  collapse  futures  based upon which resilient futures are described to avoid the various collapsed states  in the process of designing backcasting scenarios  fault tree analysis  fta  is used to support the generation of various risk factors and countermeasures to improve resilience  in order to test the effectiveness of the proposed method  we provide a case study to describe resilient energy systems for a japanese community to 2030  four expert workshops involving researchers from different disciplines were organized to generate diversified ideas on resilient energy systems  the results show that three scenarios of collapsed energy systems were described  in which policy options to be taken toward achieving resilient energy systems were derived   c  2017 elsevier inc  all rights reserved  
 determinants and consequences of corporate development and strategy function size the corporate development and strategy function at headquarters is critical for contemporary firms  strategy activities  yet we know little about its design and structure  we explore how firms determine the need for strategy resources at the corporate level and  thus  the corporate development and strategy function size  as well as the extent to which they benefit from this structural choice  drawing on a survey of chief strategy officers from 105 large listed european firms  as well as archival data  our analysis indicates that  a  the number of corporate development and strategy function employees differs substantially across firms  suggesting distinct corporate development and strategy function types and economies of scale in the corporate development and strategy function   b  environmental  strategic  and structural factors explain this variance  and  c  the corporate development and strategy function size is consequential for a firm s performance  although one size does not fit all firms  overall  the study highlights the importance of strategy professionals and functions for a firm s strategy processes  
 determinants of long  versus short term bank credit in eu countries this paper empirically examines the determinants of credit at different maturities across countries of the european union during the last decade  we document the lengthening of maturities since the early 2000s and whether these patterns were driven by similar factors in advanced and emerging market economies  before the 2008 crisis  long term credit expanded faster than short term credit in most countries of our sample and contracted less than short term credit after 2008  we find that foreign liabilities were more important sources of funding in emerging market countries than in advanced economies  in addition  aggregate demand mattered less for credit extension to firms in emerging market countries than in advanced countries  
 determinants of management earnings forecasts  the case of global shipping ipos firms that go public on global stock markets are not obliged to disclose earnings forecasts in their prospectuses  we use this fact to examine the shipping industry  where most firms voluntarily issue earnings forecasts during the ipo process  thus providing unique  international level evidence  we find overall pessimistic forecasts of ship owners  primarily because of the industry s uncertain and volatile environment  high ship owner participation after going public is associated with less accurate earnings forecasts  our results further indicate that financial leverage  a listing in an emerging stock market  and global market conditions are other main factors responsible for inaccurate earnings forecasts  
 determinants of sub sovereign bond yield spreads   the role of fiscal fundamentals and federal bailout expectations this paper investigates how bailout expectations affect the extent to which yield spreads for bonds issued by sub sovereign entities within fiscal federations price in fundamentals related to default risk  the question is analysed both across and within federations using a novel dataset for sub sovereign governments that includes australian states  canadian provinces  swiss cantons  german lander  us states  spanish communities  and indian states  the paper finds that sub sovereign debt and deficit levels relative to gdp are important drivers of sub sovereign spreads  however  the weight assigned by financial markets to fundamentals when pricing sub sovereign bonds is reduced when the institutional set up of the federation allows for bailouts  moreover  within federations  the market s expectation of a federal bailout and the capacity of the federal government to provide support to the weaker members of the federation similarly affect the extent to which fundamental factors are priced into spreads  the paper shows that the positive link between debt and risk premia tends to break down when sub  sovereign government debt rises above certain thresholds  this could reflect the market s expectation of a federal bailout as fundamentals deteriorate  additionally  larger sub  sovereign entities tend to pay higher premia as fundamentals worsen which could be linked to the limited capacity of the federal government to provide support as the size of the expected bailout increases  a pattern of rising risk premia as fundamentals worsen is also found for sub  sovereign entities when the central government faces borrowing constraints   c  2017 elsevier ltd  all rights reserved  
 determinants of the crude oil futures curve  inventory  consumption and volatility since 2008  the wti oil futures curve has been positively sloped for extended periods  we test whether changes in inventory alone can explain this atypically long contango  to do this  we estimate monthly vars of the cme wti oil futures spread and oecd and u s  inventory in line with standard theory  and add petroleum consumption and implied volatility to the vector of endogenous variables  when we model the futures spread as one continuous series  results confirm two way causation between inventory and the futures curve  as predicted by the theory of storage  however when we separate negative and positive futures spreads we find that  two way causation between the futures spread and u s  inventory breaks down  shocks to oecd petroleum consumption cause more negative spreads and shocks to u s  consumption cause more positive spreads in addition to inventory driven changes  and increases in volatility directly raise positive spreads  these new causal channels have become significant since 2008 and can be related to higher inventory  inelastic supply of oil and uncertainty about global economic conditions   c  2017 elsevier b v  all rights reserved  
 developing inland china  the role of coastal foreign direct investment and exports the design of china s foreign direct investment  fdi  and export promotion policies has intrinsic elements not helpful with the original policy intent to generate spillovers to the wide chinese economy  applying panel estimation models to chinese provincial level data for 1993 2008  we examine the impacts of china s coastal fdi and exports on its inland regions  we find that the coastal fdi has overall positive inter regional impacts  while the coastal exports do not  cooperative joint ventures generate positive impacts  but little for wholly foreign funded enterprises and even negative for equity joint ventures  the inter regional impacts do not exhibit any significance and robustness across exporters  ownership status  we attribute these counter intuitive findings to the protectionist behaviours of state owned enterprises in equity joint ventures and the prevalence of processing exports  
 development of absorptive capacity over time and across boundaries  the case of r d consortia absorptive capacity  ac  has been identified as the ability of firms to acquire  assimilate  and apply external knowledge  and thus as a pre condition for learning from knowledge environment  however  extant literature has focused on ac as  1  a static and  2  a firm centred concept  in particular  there is little conceptual framing and empirical evidence of how ac develops over time and across boundaries  taking r d consortia as the unit of analysis and based on insights from three in depth case studies of collaborative r d  our contribution is a framework for ac development over time and across inter organizational  intra organizational  and practice boundaries at different stages of collaboration in r d consortia  using this framework  we identify a set of mechanisms which enable the development of ac and we discuss the preconditions for these mechanisms  for r d managers  our research implies that in order to enhance effectiveness of knowledge transfer and learning in r d consortia they need to develop a strategy that  1  supports learning and ac development throughout the whole cycle of the collaboration  not only by focusing on intra firm capabilities  but in particular by providing flexible interfaces for overcoming a variety of interaction and learning boundaries between heterogeneous r d partners  and  2  enables the integration of created and acquired knowledge within the organization once the collaboration is over   c  2017 elsevier ltd  all rights reserved  
 did saving wall street really save main street  the real effects of tarp on local economic conditions we investigate whether saving wall street through tarp really saved main street during the recent financial crisis  our difference in difference analysis suggests that tarp statistically and economically significantly increased net job creation and net hiring establishments and decreased business and personal bankruptcies  the results are robust  including accounting for endogeneity  the main mechanisms driving the results appear to be increases in commercial real estate lending and off balance sheet real estate guarantees  these results suggest that saving wall street via tarp may have helped save main street  complementing the tarp literature and contributing to the cost benefit debate  
 did the 1999 nyse and nasdaq listing standard changes on audit committee composition benefit investors  in december 1999  the sec instituted a new listing standard for nyse and nasdaq firms  listed firms were now required to maintain fully independent audit committees with at least three members  in july 2002  the u s  congress legislated these standards through the sarbanes oxley act  our research question is whether all investors benefited from the 1999 new rule  using both an event study and a difference in differences methodology  we find no evidence of higher market value or better financial reporting quality resulting from this rule  
 did the financial crisis affect the market valuation of large systemic us banks  we examine the impact of the financial crisis on the stock market valuation of large and systemic u s  bank holding companies  bhcs   using the bertsatos and sakellaris  2016  model of fundamental valuation of bank equity  we provide evidence that the financial crisis has not altered investors  attitudes towards bank characteristics  in particular  before  during  and after the crisis  investors in large and systemic u s  bhcs seemed to penalize leverage  albeit temporarily  both before and after the crisis  they reward size in the short run  this pattern is appearing only briefly during the crisis  we also show that bank opacity plays no role in market valuation either in the short run or in the long run  last but not least  we find evidence that stress testing has been informative to the market and that those bhcs that failed at the post crisis stress tests were not subsequently valued differently by the market   c  2017 elsevier b v  all rights reserved  
 differences in herding  individual vs  institutional investors using a trading volume based measure  we study the differences between institutional and individual investors in herding  first  better informed institutional investors trade more selectively  whereas less informed individuals allocate their investments evenly across stocks  second  individual investors rely more on public information for their trades as they are influenced by market sentiment and attention grabbing events  third  institutional investors react asymmetrically to up  and down market movements  whereas individual investors do not  finally  despite these differences in herding both individual and institutional investors pay close attention to one another s trades in forming a consensus  c  2016 elsevier b v  all rights reserved  
 digital entrepreneurship  toward a digital technology perspective of entrepreneurship new digital technologies have transformed the nature of uncertainty inherent in entrepreneurial processes and outcomes as well as the ways of dealing with such uncertainty  this has raised important questions at the intersection of digital technologies and entrepreneurship on digital entrepreneurship  we consider two broad implications less bounded entrepreneurial processes and outcomes and less predefined locus of entrepreneurial agency and advance a research agenda that calls for the explicit theorizing of concepts related to digital technologies  in articulating the promise and value of such a digital technology perspective  we consider how it would build on and enrich existing entrepreneurship theories  
 digital maker entrepreneurs in open design  what activities make up their business model  the business models of digital maker entrepreneurs in open design are inextricably linked to the broader open design community  digital makers share designs on online platforms such as thingiverse and use digital manufacturing technology such as 3 d printing as a generative mechanism for their entrepreneurial activities  there is a general understanding of how sharing works in that community and the basic design parameters that determine the business models of these digital maker entrepreneurs  which are based on a portfolio of activities  this study is based on in depth interviews with 11 digital maker entrepreneurs from the open design community  we investigate the activities that constitute their business models using activity theory as a lens with which better to understand them  this study provides a perspective on the complexity of the relationships in which these activities are embedded and analyzes the activities related to the production  distribution  and consumption of value  finally  we examine the exchanges between digital maker entrepreneurs in the community  shedding light on how digital maker entrepreneurs share and exchange goods  services  and knowledge as peers   c  2017 kelley school of business  indiana university  published by elsevier inc  all rights reserved  
 directional predictability from stock market sector indices to gold  a cross quantilogram analysis we address the safe haven properties of gold relative to us stock market sector indices using the bivariate cross quantilogram of han et al   2016   splitting our sample into pre  and post crisis periods  our results show that the safe haven properties of gold have a changing nature  before and after the financial crisis  we find only limited quantile dependence and that gold can be considered a safe haven for most of the sectors  except industrials  on a full sample  1999 2016   there are only three sectors   healthcare  it  and telecommunication services for which gold can be considered a safe haven   c  2017 elsevier inc  all rights reserved  
 director compensation incentives and acquisition performance this paper investigates the relation between director compensation structure and shareholder interests in the context of acquisitions  our evidence suggests that acquirer firms that compensate their directors with a higher proportion of incentive based compensation have significantly higher stock returns around the announcement  compared to acquirers in the lowequity based compensation group  acquirers in the high equity based compensation group outperform by 9 54  in a five day period surrounding the announcement date  these results hold even after controlling for endogeneity issues  we further find that acquirerswith higher equity based pay exhibit greater improvements in stock price and operating performance in the three years following acquisitions  an increase in director equity based pay also results in a lower acquisition premiumfor targets  these results indicate that equity based compensation provides incentives for directors to make decisions that meet the interests of shareholders   c  2017 elsevier inc  all rights reserved  
 disaggregating the corporate headquarters  investor reactions to inversion announcements by us firms internationally disaggregated headquarters arise from cross border relocations of headquarters components  to shed more light on the business consequences of such component relocations  we analyse stock market reactions to inversion initiatives  which are plans by us firms to offshore their registered seat  combining business economics and institutional theory  we develop an explanatory framework centred on repatriation taxes on foreign income  since inversions enable us firms to free themselves from such taxes in the us  we hypothesize that inversions by firms that face higher us tax costs in repatriating income will be received more positively by investors  and especially so if the inversion s destination country has no repatriation tax  yet by freeing themselves from us repatriation taxes  inverting firms deprive the us government of tax revenues and will therefore likely lose legitimacy among us officials  the risks associated with losing such legitimacy  we argue  are higher for firms that are more dependent on the us government  causing the relationship between the us tax costs of repatriating income and investor reactions to inversions to be less positive for such firms  we find substantial support for our framework in an event study of up to 117 inversions announced over the period 1990 2016  our findings argue for a nuanced  contingency view of the business consequences of inverting and suggest that legitimacy losses are not always as hazardous as previously thought  
 disentangling antecedents and performance effects of family sme innovation  a knowledge based perspective understanding how family small and medium sized enterprises  smes  seize opportunities for innovation and thus achieve superior performance is of substantial interest to family firm managers and academia  this paper develops a conceptual framework of antecedents that include resources internal and external to the firm in the two major dimensions of technological innovation  ti  and management innovation  mi  and their effects on financial performance  the framework is empirically tested with survey data from 152 manufacturing family smes in the d a ch countries  which comprise germany  d   austria  a  and switzerland  ch   drawing on the knowledge based view  the results highlight the central role of firm external knowledge for family firm innovation  which is inherent in an industry s technological opportunities and interorganizational collaboration  furthermore  results show that it is only through technological innovation that family firms can capitalize on innovation  finally  management innovation is still observed to constitute a vital complement for technological innovation in that it is an enabler for innovation in products and processes  recommendations for practice include the need for technological innovation  openness toward collaborations with external partners and receptiveness to knowledge from external sources

 diversification opportunities between emerging and frontier asian  efa  and developed stock markets we show a stable long run relationship between three developed and ten emerging frontier asian  efa  equity markets over the period 2000 to 2013 using daily  weekly  and monthly data  across the three frequencies  djia returns are good predictors of efa markets but the predictive power of nikkei225 and s p 500 differ  further  during the gfc  the djia and nikkei225  not s p 500  are influential  non gfc periods see all three important but s p 500 was more persistent  we also reveal that the developed markets may be more important than other emerging market predictors  such as exchange rates and oil price shocks   c  2017 elsevier inc  all rights reserved  
 do all new brooms sweep clean  evidence for outside bank appointments banks in bad financial shape are more likely to appoint executive directors from the outside than those in good shape  it is  however  not clear whether all of these appointments necessarily lead to the desired turnaround  we analyze the performance effects of new board members with external boardroom experience  outsiders  by distinguishing between good and bad managerial abilities of executives based on either roa or risk return efficiency of their previous employers  our results show that banks appointing bad outsiders underperform other banks while those appointing good outsiders do so to a lesser extent  the performance differentials are highly pronounced in high risk banks and in the post crisis period   c  2017 elsevier b v  all rights reserved  
 do bond credit ratings lead to excess comovement  we investigate whether non fundamental comovement results from investors using credit ratings to group assets into different  styles   we find that bonds that join a new rating class start comoving more with the bonds in this class  even when fundamental factors suggest otherwise  we show that this co movement effect varies according to the nature of the bond considered  and the modalities of the rating action  downgrades have a larger impact than upgrades  and rating reviews matter as much as actual movements  finally  rating changes between grades bbb and bb  which lead bonds to be reclassified as either  high yield  or  investment grade  assets  seem to be of particular importance   c  2017 elsevier b v  all rights reserved

 do consumers value price transparency  we examine the role of price transparency in consumer preferences and demand  we assemble a detailed dataset on the driving school industry in portugal to quantify how firms present the price of the course of instruction  and its individual components  to potential students  our unique data allows us to estimate a structural model of school choice and measure the impact of varying levels of price information on demand  the results show that consumers are willing to pay a significant amount for price transparency  on average 11  of the service price  and that consumer demographics drive heterogeneous preferences for transparency  
 do foreign investors destabilize stock markets  a reexamination of korea in 2008 motivated by choe  kho  and stulz  1999   cks   this paper reexamines whether foreign investors destabilize the korean stock markets during the 2008 global financial crisis  consistent with cks  large sales by foreigners don t result in significant negative returns over the next 25 minutes of trading  however  when the price impact is measured per trade  the impact of foreigners increases sharply during the crisis  and even surpasses that of korean individuals and institutions  this is particularly pronounced in the permanent components  and in large  liquid stocks  the influence of foreigners therefore is not negligible in emerging markets  although it does not destabilize the whole market on its own  
 do foreign mergers and acquisitions boost firm productivity  this paper examines the causal relationship between foreign mergers and acquisitions  m   a  and the productivity of acquired firms using micro data from the uk over the period 1999 2007  our results suggest a significant heterogeneity in the total factor productivity  tfp  effects of foreign m   a at the industry level  overall  we uncover a systematic pattern of post acquisition tfp effects that is consistent with the most recent theoretical models of firm heterogeneity and cross border mergers and acquisitions as mode of foreign entry  furthermore  we find positive aggregate effects on labor productivity due to capital deepening but not due to changes in tfp  
 do futures prices help forecast the spot price  this study proposes a futures based unobserved components model for commodity spot prices  prices quoted at the same time incorporate the same information  but are affected differently  resulting in the different shapes of futures curves  this model utilizes information from part of the futures curve to improve forecasting accuracy of the spot price  applying this model to oil market data  i find that the model forecasts outperform the literature benchmark  the no change forecast  and futures prices forecasts in multiple dimensions  with smaller average error variation over the sample period and higher chance of smaller absolute error in each period  
 do loyal customers really pay more for services  service firms are encouraged by historic evidence that loyal customers are less price sensitive  yet  some research has challenged the assertion while others have demonstrated considerable heterogeneity within loyal segments  aiming to reconcile this debate  we investigate the relationship between customers  behavioral loyalty and the importance they place on price relative to two managerially relevant service attributes  rewards and convenience  we also assess the moderating role of attitudinal loyalty resulting from superior service experience  results from a longitudinal survey and transaction data from an airline carrier show that as customers  behavioral loyalty increases  they place more importance on price and less importance on rewards and convenience  revealing that behavioral loyalty causes a shift in emphasis toward price  as a result  behaviorally loyal customers spend less and revenue decreases  however  by improving attitudinal loyalty  firms achieve the desired outcome of reducing price sensitivity and increasing revenue  specifically  after experiencing better service  behaviorally loyal customers focus less on price and instead shift their focus toward rewards and convenience  and this results in revenue gains for the firm  overall  attitudinal loyalty from better service experience acts as a key mitigator of the positive link between behavioral loyalty and price sensitivity  
 do managerial practices matter in innovation and firm performance relations  new evidence from the uk the innovation and firm performance relationship remains a puzzle  as all types of innovation are not equally beneficial  besides  better managed firms can perform better  integrating these two strands of literature  we examine whether managerial practices explain this relationship using data from uk firms during 1992 2014  we find that firms which focus on r d activities jointly with better managerial practices benefit favourably  during the post crisis period  higher intangibles are only beneficial when combined with r d activity  also firms with better managerial practices and innovative activities exhibit a positive effect of higher leverage  finally  an inverse u shaped result supports the schumpeterian theory of creative destruction

 do managers give hometown labor an edge  in line with the psychological theory of place attachments  managers favor hometown workers over others  consistent with this prediction  i find that following periods of industry distress  establishments located near ceos  childhood homes experience fewer employment and pay reductions and are less likely to be divested relative to other firm establishments  while it is not possible to directly test whether this employment bias destroys firm value  managers only implement these policies when governance is weak  suggesting that this favoritism is suboptimal  together  these results provide direct evidence of employee favoritism and show that idiosyncratic manager styles impact corporate employment decisions  
 do managers overreact to salient risks  evidence from hurricane strikes we study how managers respond to hurricane events when their firms are located in the neighborhood of the disaster area  we find that the sudden shock to the perceived liquidity risk leads managers to increase corporate cash holdings and to express more concerns about hurricane risk in 10 ks 10 qs  even though the actual risk remains unchanged  both effects are temporary  over time  the perceived risk decreases  and the bias disappears  the distortion between perceived and actual risk is large  and the increase in cash is suboptimal  overall  managerial reaction to hurricanes is consistent with salience theories of choice   c  2017 elsevier b v  all rights reserved  
 do men and women use different tactics to cope with the embarrassment of buying condoms  it has been proposed that people cope with the embarrassment of acquiring condoms using a variety of tactics  such as buying from a sales clerk of the same gender or buying additional products  however  the actual use and efficacy of these coping mechanisms have not been rigorously evaluated  this research investigates three specific questions related to coping with embarrassment   r1  do people prefer cashiers of the same gender when buying condoms because it helps them cope with embarrassment or because of the similarity attraction effect   r2  when multiple coping mechanisms are available  do people use more than one at a time  and  r3  do men and women prefer different coping tactics  using an experimental design  study 1 investigates r1 and finds support for both explanations  studies 2 and 3 use field and lab experiments  respectively  to investigate r2 and r3  the findings indicate that people only use one coping tactic at a time and that men and women have a different preference for coping tactics  women prefer coping tactics that mask condom acquisition  while men prefer social emotional support tactics  furthermore  discrepancies between the field experiment and lab experiments indicate that people underestimate the influence of embarrassment on their actual behavior  
 do online shops support customers  decision strategies by interactive information management tools  results of an empirical analysis online shops provide a multitude of products with different attributes to their customers  this enormous information supply often leads to information overload  which may negatively affect customer satisfaction and conversion rates  therefore  interactive decision aids  particularly interactive information management tools  can help customers to control the information supply by filtering  sorting  or comparing product attributes  moreover  interactive information management tools support different decision strategies that customers apply in online shopping decision processes  for example  a customer applying the elimination by aspects strategy eliminates products that do not meet the cutoff value for the most important attribute  customers repeat this elimination process for the second most important attribute  the third most important attribute and so on  and processing continues until a single product remains  an online shop with filtering tools supports application of this strategy  this study describes a set of well known decision strategies  and examines whether online shops provide interactive information management tools that support the application of these decision strategies  we examined the 100 largest online shops in north america in order to analyze their provided interactive information management tools  results show that the online shops support decision strategies which are frequently used by customers  e g   elimination by aspects strategy   in general  the supported decision strategies are qualitative and noncompensatory in nature  that is  customers applying such strategies compare values in their decision process  but do not involve summing  subtracting  and or multiplying attribute values  and customers do also not make trade offs among attribute values  hence  compensating for a bad value on one attribute with a good value on another attribute is uncommon  we discuss implications of our results for online shop companies and developers of online shop systems   c  2017 elsevier b v  all rights reserved  
 do product market threats affect analyst forecast precision  we examine how product market threats influence the precision of analyst forecasts  greater competitive threats may make forecasting more difficult by increasing the uncertainty regarding future cash flows and by influencing the quality of financial disclosure  using a firm specific measure of product market threats  i e   fluidity   we find that analysts are more likely to be less precise forecasting earnings for highly fluid firms and that the lack of precision is not fully explained by performance volatility  our findings further suggest that firms with fluid products have lower accruals quality and that they are more likely to withheld information regarding contract terms and sales from major customers  cross sectional analysis further suggests that the effect of fluidity on analyst forecasts is more pronounced when firms have flexibility in disclosure choices  using significant changes in tariff rates as a quasi natural experiment  we find that analyst forecast precision is significantly lower following tariff reductions  
 do product returns hurt relational outcomes  some evidence from online retailing customer product returns are a key challenge for online retailers  previous research primarily focused on causes of returns and possible interventions to reduce customers  product returns and concomitant costs for online retailers  however  little is known about the effect of product returns on key relational outcomes  drawing on relationship marketing theory  we test a model that relates product returns to three relationship marketing outcomes customer satisfaction  trust  and positive word of mouth  a field study based on online panel data from customers of eight large online retailers demonstrates that product returns negatively affect customer satisfaction with the retailer  customer trust  and word of mouth  the findings extend previous research by revealing that product returns can detrimentally affect relationships with customers  implications for e commerce research and management are discussed  
 do stars shine  comparing the performance persistence of star sell side analysts listed by institutional investor  the wall street journal  and starmine we investigate the profitability persistence of the investment recommendations from analysts listed in four different star rankings  institutional investor magazine  starmine s  top earnings estimators  and  top stock pickers   and the wall street journal  and show the predictive power of each evaluation methodology  we found that only buy and strong buy recommendations from the entire group of star analysts outperform those of the non stars in the year after election  while sell and strong sell recommendations performed as those of the non stars  we document that the highest average monthly abnormal return of holding a long short portfolio  0 97    is obtained by following the recommendations of the group of star sell side analysts rated by starmine s  top earnings estimators  during the period from 2003 to 2014  since earnings are one of the main drivers of stock prices  the results obtained are in line with the notion that focusing on superior earnings forecasts is one of the top requirements for successful stock picks

 does accounting conservatism mitigate the shortcomings of ceo overconfidence  overconfident ceos are more willing to initiate investment projects that require experimentation  yet tend to defer responding to the bad news when the project is not performing as planned  accounting conservatism accelerates the recognition of the bad news and its dissemination to gatekeepers  making it more likely that the ceo will acknowledge the problem earlier and start searching for solutions  therefore  firms where both characteristics ceo overconfidence and accounting conservatism are present should perform better  our empirical tests confirm this prediction  firms that practice conservative accounting and are run by overconfident ceos exhibit better cash flow performance  our results continue to hold in a variety of settings  including market reactions to acquisitions  cash flow downside risk  and analyst following  further  the joint positive effect of ceo overconfidence and accounting conservatism on firm performance is stronger in high uncertainty environments and in firms facing less stringent financing constraints  consistent with theoretical predictions  
 does an embedded wind turbine reduce a company s electricity bill  case study of a 300 kw wind turbine in ireland in recent years  a growing number of small to medium enterprises are embracing wind turbine projects not only as part of their cost reduction strategy but also to actively play their part in the global fight against climate change  however  it would appear there are currently limited empirical studies carried out in this emerging industry  this case study analyses the cost effectiveness of one such wind turbine initiative by a company in the republic of ireland  who invested in a 300 kw embedded wind turbine project at the end of 2013  the research methodology which is primarily a case study analysis included comparing historical electricity utility bills which allowed the 2013 quantity of electrical energy units imported  i e  the year before the turbine was installed to be compared with the 2014 value  i e  the year after the turbine was installed  numerous site visits were undertaken over a four year period  during which electric meter readings were recorded and stored  the findings of this piece of research indicate that the installation of the embedded wind turbine had minimal positive effect on the annual electricity costs for the company  indeed the turbine appears to have significant negative effects such as a need for an increased maximum import capacity and also it appeared to contribute to a deteriorating utility power factor  while the aesthetic nature of the on site turbine seemed to create a positive image of the company  it would appear that caution should be exercised when business owners select alternative energy providers who claim to be experts in the energy field but may have limited knowledge in this area of wind energy  which as of yet has minimal robust research into all aspects of its benefits attributes

 does cross listing increase managers  propensity to listen to the market in m a deals  we investigate the validity of two conjectures regarding the impact of cross listing on managers  propensity to listen to the market in mergers and acquisitions  m a  deals  the first maintains that cross listing in the us improves price informativeness and investor protection leading managers of cross listed firms to listen to the market when considering m a deal  the second postulates that the lack of law enforcement by the us securities and exchange commission  sec  against foreign firms impairs cross listing as an effective mechanism to deter opportunistic managers  as a result  managers tend to ignore market signals in m a deals  we find that managers of cross listed firms from strong shareholder protection countries are more likely to listen to the market  further analysis indicates that the likelihood to listen to the market differs by host market  while we do not find an association between cross listing and listening to the market for firms cross listed on the us regulated exchanges  there is some evidence that cross listing on unregulated market affects the propensity to follow market signals  we find that listening to the market improves firm value and the impact is enhanced post cross listing due to improvement in stock price informativeness   c  2017 elsevier b v  all rights reserved  
 does environmental regulation affect labor demand in china  evidence from the textile printing and dyeing industry c developing countries  including china  are just beginning to figure out how to balance economic development with the desire to address numerous severe environmental problems  in this paper  we use two enterprise level data sets   china s environmental statistics database and china s industrial enterprise database   to estimate the impact of a more stringent wastewater discharge standard imposed on all the textile printing and dyeing enterprises in the lake tai  jiangsu region  on labor demand  we find that enterprises which face this new more stringent standard decreased labor demand by approximately 7   furthermore  we find that the new standard had heterogeneous impacts on different types of enterprises  for example  our results indicate that the more stringent discharge standard reduced employment in domestically owned private enterprises by 7 4   but had little or no impact on state owned or foreign owned enterprises   c  2017 elsevier inc  all rights reserved

 does information asymmetry affect corporate tax aggressiveness  we investigate the effect of information asymmetry on corporate tax avoidance  using a difference in differences matching estimator to assess the effects of changes in analyst coverage caused by broker closures and mergers  we find that firms avoid tax more aggressively after a reduction in analyst coverage  we further find that this effect is mainly driven by firms with higher existing tax planning capacity  e g   tax haven presence   smaller initial analyst coverage  and a smaller number of peer firms  moreover  the effect is more pronounced in industries where reputation matters more and in firms subject to less monitoring from tax authorities  
 does innovation drive environmental disclosure  a new insight into sustainable development sustainable development is a hot topic in business and the media  and there is a growing demand for reliable environmental disclosure from a wide range of stakeholders  ethical performance  including social and environmental performance  is actively scrutinized  a firm s stakeholders expect reliable disclosure to correctly assess its performance  research on the link between environmental disclosure and environmental performance shows mixed results  both a positive and a negative association have been found  this study reexamines this association by considering environmental innovation as a key determinant of environmental disclosure  we find that environmental performance and environmental innovation jointly determine environmental disclosure  at low levels of environmental performance  innovative firms tend to disclose more than their non innovative counterparts to inform stakeholders about their innovation and strategy to obtain an improved environmental performance  this disclosure gap tends to diminish as innovative firms become better environmental performers  the higher levels of environmental disclosure are closely associated with firms  environmental performance for both groups  copyright  c  2017 john wiley   sons  ltd and erp environment 
 does institutional ownership matter for international stock return comovement  we study the link between international stock return comovements and institutional investment  we test whether the rise of institutional ownership has increased cross country correlations and decreased cross industry correlations  using stock level institutional holdings across 45 countries during the 2001 2010 period  we find that industry and global factors are relatively more important the country factors in explaining stock return variation among stocks with higher institutional ownership  industry diversification strategies are more beneficial than country diversification strategies for stocks with high institutional ownership  we show that cross border portfolio investment is a powerful force of international capital market integration and convergence of asset prices   c  2017 elsevier ltd  all rights reserved  
 does it pay to be eco  the mediating role of competitive benefits and the effect of iso14001 eco innovation has become an important instrument to help companies reduce their environmental impact and gain a competitive advantage in increasingly competitive environments  despite recent research conducted in this field  findings concerning the relationship between eco innovation and firm performance remain conflicting  inconclusive and incomplete  this study aimed to clarify this relationship by incorporating competitive benefits as a mediator between eco innovation and firm performance  three core questions are examined  how does eco innovation influence competitive benefits and firm performance  do competitive benefits mediate the relationship between eco innovation and firm performance  how does iso14001 influence competitive benefits and firm performance  the study finds that competitive benefits mediate and strengthen the relationship between eco innovation and firm performance  in addition  the results reveal that iso14001 positively affects competitive benefits and thus leads to greater competitive benefits  while the association between iso14001 and firm performance is not found to be statistically significant  the paper concludes with a discussion of implications for policy makers and companies  limitations  and future research directions   c  2017 elsevier ltd  all rights reserved  
 does more complex language in fomc decisions impact financial markets  this paper is built around a simple premise that is based on the theoretical models of harris and raviv  1993  and kandel and pearson  1995   complex statements are more difficult to interpret and may be construed in different ways by different agents  this creates heterogeneity of beliefs among market participants that manifests in increased market activity  we introduce novel measures of linguistic complexity  readability and word count  for the fomc statements that accompany monetary policy decisions  the empirical evidence shows that monetary policy surprises have a significant impact on financial markets  and clearly demonstrates that more complex language significantly increases the trading volume  and volatility of returns  in stock  bond  and currency markets  we also establish that financial markets are more responsive to monetary policy decisions  and the language of those statements  during recession   c  2017 elsevier b v  all rights reserved  
 does organizational creativity always drive market performance  this study develops and tests arguments that the relationship between organizational creativity and market performance is channeled through new product development  npd  capability  and that the indirect effect of creativity on performance  via npd capability  is conditional upon levels of environment dynamism and market responsiveness  the proposed relationships are tested on a sample of 221 small  and medium sized enterprises  smes  in a major sub saharan african market  findings from the study indicate that process and product npd capabilities partially mediate the effect of novelty and usefulness elements of organizational creativity on market performance  the study further finds that while environment dynamism weakens the indirect effects of novelty and usefulness of organizational creativity  via process and product npd capabilities  on market performance  the effects are strengthened under conditions of greater responsiveness to target market needs  a theoretical contribution from this study is the finding that how organizational creativity dimensions drive market performance is more complex than previously thought  it depends on whether or not organizational creativity components are first used to develop an organization s process and product innovation capabilities  and whether target market environment conditions are dynamic and an organization has ability to respond to target market demands  
 does ownership structure matter  the effects of insider and institutional ownership on corporate social responsibility the extant literature has examined the effects of ownership structures on corporate social responsibility  csr   yet it has overlooked the non linear and interactive effects among major shareholder groups  in this study  we examine the non linear effects of insider and institutional ownerships on csr  we also examine whether it is necessary to have both incentive alignment and monitoring mechanisms  complementary view  or it is sufficient to have either mechanism  substitutive view  to promote csr  using a sample of the u s  fortune 1000 firms  our results suggest that insider and institutional ownerships have non linear effects on csr  we also find support for the complementary mechanisms view  in that the highest csr rating is observed when both ownership levels are high  therefore  firms need to maintain strong governance structures to realize synergistic effects in promoting csr  our findings provide a more in depth understanding of the relationships between ownership structures and corporate social outcomes  
 does pulling together lead to falling apart  the self regulatory consequences of cooperative orientations for the self reliant much evidence exists to support the hypothesis that cooperation improves performance outcomes for both organizations and individuals  in spite of this  relatively little attention has been paid to the potential downstream consequences of asking self reliant individuals to work and pursue goals in a team setting  where their success depends heavily on cooperation and the performance of others  this paper explores these downstream consequences  across three studies  our results reveal that individuals prompted with self reliance lose significant self regulatory capacity after cooperating as opposed to competing individually  which leads them to act dishonestly  experiments 1 and 3  and quit a  task early  experiment 2   together  these findings highlight that cooperation  despite the performance advantages it offers teams  can also contribute to unforeseen costs for highly self reliant individuals  
 does red bull give wings to vodka  placebo effects of marketing labels on perceived intoxication and risky attitudes and behaviors why sexual assaults and car accidents are associated with the consumption of alcohol mixed with energy drinks  amed  is still unclear  in a single study  we show that the label used to describe amed cocktails can have causal non pharmacological effects on consumers  perceived intoxication  attitudes  and behaviors  young men who consumed a cocktail of fruit juice  vodka  and red bull felt more intoxicated  took more risks  were more sexually self confident  but intended to wait longer before driving when the cocktail s label emphasized the presence of the energy drink  a  vodka red bull cocktail   compared to when it did not  a  vodka  or  exotic fruits  cocktail   speaking to the process underlying these placebo effects  we found no moderation of experience but a strong interaction with expectations  these effects were stronger for people who believe that energy drinks boost alcohol intoxication and who believe that intoxication increases impulsiveness  reduces sexual inhibition  and weakens reflexes  these findings have implications for understanding marketing placebo effects and for the pressing debate on the regulation of the marketing of energy drinks   c  2017 society for consumer psychology  published by elsevier inc  all rights reserved

 dynamic capabilities and firm performance this paper juxtaposes conflicting claims about the relationship between codified dynamic capabilities and firm performance at different levels of environmental dynamism  furthermore  it argues that the contradictory propositions and findings in prior research are due to said relationship being contingent on key  yet thus far overlooked and unaccounted for  factors internal to the firm such as dynamism exposure and asset base complexity  empirical tests in the context of the mutual funds industry provide evidence that the performance contribution of codified dynamic capabilities does decline as environmental dynamism increases  yet for any given level of environmental dynamism the magnitude and even the sign of the performance contribution of codified dynamic capabilities are significantly influenced by firms  dynamism exposure and asset base complexity  going beyond received wisdom  this study advances a more nuanced contingency approach to dynamic capabilities which contributes to a better understanding of how the value of dynamic capabilities is shaped by a complex interplay of environmental and internal factors   c  2017 elsevier ltd  all rights reserved  
 dynamic capability and firm performance  the role of marketing capability and operations capability scholars have argued that dynamic capability can influence firm performance through a variety of means and mechanisms  however  the empirical test of the relationship between dynamic capability  marketing capability  and operations capability on firm performance has remained scant  we contribute to resolving this issue by proposing a research model that links dynamic capability with marketing and operations capabilities on new product development performance specifically and firm performance generally  first  the model suggests that marketing capability and operations capability act as mediating mechanisms that transmit the positive influences of dynamic capability to new product development performance specifically and firm performance generally  second  the model proposes the relationship between marketing capability  operations capability  and firm performance  new product development performance  be stronger if firms have adequate dynamic capability  drawing on a dataset of multiyear longitudinal survey data of chinese high tech firms  we find support for the proposed model  the findings help us better explain the different ways in which dynamic capability affect performance

 early peek advantage  efficient price discovery with tiered information disclosure from 2007 to june 2013  a small group of fee paying  high speed traders receive the michigan index of consumer sentiment two seconds before its broader release  within this early peek window  we find highly concentrated trading and a fast price discovery of less than 200 milliseconds  outside this narrow window  general investors trade at fully adjusted prices  we further establish a causal relationship between the early peek mechanism and the fast price discovery by isolating the impact of the early peek arrangement along two dimensions  in cross section  we use other news releases without the early peek  as controls   in time series  we use the sudden suspension of the early peek arrangement in july 2013  as the treatment   our difference in difference tests directly connect the early peek arrangement to more efficient price discovery   it results in faster price discovery  lower volatility  and faster resolution of uncertainty  these results show that contrary to the common perception  tiered information release may help to reduce  rather than enhance  the informational advantage of faster traders and improve the efficiency of the price discovery process in financial markets   c  2017 published by elsevier b v  
 earnings quality and short selling  evidence from real earnings management in the united states prior research provides evidence consistent with managers using real earnings management  rem  to increase earnings  this study examines whether short sellers exploit the overvaluation of firms employing rem  i find that firms with more rem have higher subsequent short interest  the positive relation between rem and short interest is more pronounced in settings where the costs associated with accrual based earnings management are high  such as when a firm has low accounting flexibility or faces greater scrutiny from a high quality auditor  i also find some evidence that short sellers respond to rem more than to other fundamental signals of firm overvaluation  my inferences are robust to the use of propensity score matching  collectively  my evidence suggests that short sellers not only trade on rem information  but they also trade as if they understand the substitutive nature of alternative earnings management methods  this study provides additional insight into the important role that short sellers play in monitoring managerial operating decisions and overall earnings quality  
 eco innovation and business performance  the moderating effects of environmental orientation and resource commitment in green oriented smes drawing on the eco innovation and resource based view  this research attempts to contribute to the eco innovation performance debate by examining the effects of eco innovation on business performance  in particular  we propose that the eco innovation performance relationship is contingent on environmental orientation and resources commitment  the analysis of 83 green oriented smes in new zealand suggests that eco innovation has a positive effect on business performance  more interestingly  the findings show although environmental orientation does not directly influence business performance  it enhances the positive effect of eco innovation on business performance  the results further suggest that green oriented firms will reap more performance benefit of eco innovation when they commit more organizational resources  
 economic assessment of mitigating damage of flood events  cost benefit analysis of flood proofing commercial buildings in umbria  italy floods are among the costliest natural disasters worldwide  integrated flood risk management approaches involving both public and private measures have been proposed to cope with trends in flood risk  these approaches are hampered by a lack of information about the cost effectiveness of private flood damage mitigation measures  this study examines the economic desirability of flood proofing different types of commercial buildings in umbria  which is a flood prone region in europe  a cost benefit analysis  cba  is applied  which uses empirical information on flood damages to a variety of commercial activities  the cba accounts for a diversity of uncertainties  including those of flood damage statistics and related flood proofing benefits derived from bootstrap methods  results show that  on average  dry flood proofing is economically attractive for certain categories of commercial buildings  the flood probability and uncertainty of damage are key factors driving cba results  implications of our findings for policymakers and insurers are discussed  
 economic links and the spillover effect of earnings quality on market risk based on the theoretical framework of lambert  leuz  and verrecchia  2007   i predict that higher earnings quality of economically related public firms reduces a firm s systematic market risk  using alternative sets of economically related firms  this study provides significant evidence consistent with my prediction  specifically  a conditional capm regression shows that not only a firm s earnings quality  but also the earnings quality of related public firms lowers the loading of firm excess return on the market factor  regressions based on the three factor model provide similar results  further  i provide evidence on cross sectional variations in the effect of related firms  earnings quality  these results are economically significant and robust in several additional tests  overall  this study contributes to the literature by providing the first evidence on the long term externalities of financial information quality in the capital market  
 economic policy uncertainty and sovereign credit rating decisions  panel quantile evidence for the eurozone we employ a panel quantile framework that quantifies the relative importance of quantitative and qualitative factors across the conditional distribution of sovereign credit ratings in the eurozone area  we find that regulatory quality and competitiveness have a stronger impact for low rated countries whereas gdp per capita is a major driver of high rated countries  a reduction in the current account deficit leads to a rating or outlook upgrade for low rated countries  economic policy uncertainty impacts negatively on credit ratings across the conditional distribution  however  the impact is stronger for the lower rated countries  in other words  the creditworthiness of low rated countries takes a much bigger  hit  than that of high rated countries when european policy uncertainty is on the rise   c  2017 the author s   
 economic risk premia in the fixed income markets  the intraday evidence we use high frequency data to precisely estimate bond price reactions to macroeconomic announcements and the associated compensation for macro risks  we find evidence of a single factor summarizing the reaction of bond prices to different announcements  before the financial crisis  the factor risk premium is substantial  significant  and mainly earned before announcement releases  after the crisis  the stock bond covariance becomes negative and the preannouncement factor risk premium becomes insignificant  our empirical results are consistent with information leakages that take place ahead of announcement releases and with the implications of a long run risks model of bond risk premia  
 economic  environmental  and social impact of remanufacturing in a competitive setting this paper studies the environmental and social trade offs of remanufacturing for product service firms under competition  we use an analytical model and a behavioral study that together incorporate demand cannibalization from multiple customer segments across the competing firms  product lines  we measure firms  profits  consumer surpluses  environmental impacts  and environmental costs along the products lifecycles in the resultant equilibria with and without remanufacturing  we show that competition intensifies the tension between increased profit and worsened environmental impact from market expansions caused by remanufacturing identified by prior research in the case of monopoly  however  bringing in the social dimension leads to an overall positive assessment  remanufacturing creates additional consumer surplus  which compensates for the cost of the environmental impact  in other words  we found strong support that remanufacturing is beneficial for the society

 economies of scope  resource relatedness  andthedynamics of corporate diversification research summary  the dominant view has been that businesses that are more related to each other are more often combined within diversified firms  this study uses a dynamic model to demonstrate that  with inter temporal economies of scope  diversified firms are more likely to combine moderately related businesses than the most related businesses  that effect occurs because strong relatedness reduces redeployment costs and makes firms redeploy all resources to better performing businesses  the strength of that effect depends on inducements for redeployment measured as the current return advantage of one business over another business  volatilities of business returns  and correlation of those returns  this study develops hypotheses for those relationships and suggests empirical operationalizations  encouraging empiricists to retest the implications of relatedness for the dynamics of corporate diversification  managerial summary  it is believed that diversified firms are more likely to combine more related businesses because relatedness enables sharing of resources between businesses  indeed  a firm can apply knowledge created in one business to another business  avoiding costly duplication in knowledge development  resource sharing also adds value when a firm offers several products  adding the convenience of one stop shopping and charging higher prices  however  resource sharing is not the only motivation for corporate diversification  in environments where profitability of businesses changes frequently  firms diversify by redeploying part of resources from an underperforming business to a better performing business  this study uses a dynamic model to demonstrate that  with that second motivation for corporate diversification  firms end up combining moderately related businesses rather than the most related businesses  copyright  c  2017 john wiley   sons  ltd  
 educating business students about sustainability  a bibliometric review of current trends and research needs there has been substantial growth of interest in sustainability in business  management and organisational studies in recent years  this article applies oswick s  j manag spirit relig 6 1  15 25  2009  method of bibliometric research to ascertain how this growth has been reflected in scholarly publishing  particularly as it relates to business and management education over the 20 years 1994 2013  the research has found that sustainability as a general topic in business and management studies  as evidenced by scholarly publishing  has accelerated rapidly both in terms of items published and cited  in the mid 2000s  the emphasis of books published in this area began to change from one which advocated  sustainable development  to one which viewed sustainability as a management practice which could help businesses and society simultaneously  the literature on sustainability within the field of management and business education has been smaller  but has enjoyed a similar growth rate which accelerated sharply in the most recent 5 years of the dataset  most of the scholarly  peer reviewed articles analysed tend to advocate the inclusion of sustainability on business school curricula  or to demonstrate the various ways in which faculty have integrated sustainability related principles in their teaching  a smaller amount of research has been undertaken on the learning experiences of the  recipients  of these approaches  there is evidence of an extensive variety of approaches used by educators  but the most significant research need which presented is for more empirically driven studies on how and why business and management students engage with the principles of sustainability  
 effect of intelligence on consumers  responsiveness to a pro environmental tax  evidence from large scale data on car acquisitions of male consumers researchers and policy makers are increasingly interested in the effects of pro environmental tax incentives on consumer responses  however  it is unknown whether consumers  responsiveness to pro environmental taxes depends on cognitive ability  we report a natural experiment study  in which a pro environmental tax was introduced in finland  providing an economic benefit for cars with lower co2 emissions  we examine 140 000 car acquisitions by male consumers  whose intelligence had been tested by finnish defense forces  the results show that the co2 emissions of cars acquired by consumers with higher intelligence dropped more after the introduction of the tax than the emissions of cars of consumers with lower intelligence  specifically  intelligence had both a direct effect on responsiveness to the pro environmental tax  and an indirect effect via income  the effect was more pronounced for numeric intelligence than verbal and spatial logic intelligence and of equal size as that of income and other demographics  this implies that intelligence is an empirically as well as theoretically relevant variable to study as a moderator to choices that are simultaneously pro environmental and economical   c  2017 society for consumer psychology  published by elsevier inc  all rights reserved  
 effect of rollover risk on default risk  evidence from bank financing we study the effect of rollover risk on the risk of default using a comprehensive database of u s  industrial firms during 1986 2013  dependence on bank financing is the key driver of the impact of rollover risk on default risk  default risk and rollover risk present a significant positive relation in firms dependent on bank financing  in contrast  rollover risk is uncorrelated with default probability in the case of firms that do not rely on bank financing  our measure of rollover risk is the amount of long term debt maturing in one year  weighted by total assets  in the case of a firm that depends on bank financing  an increase of one standard deviation in this measure leads to a significant increase of 3 2  in its default probability within one year  other drivers affecting the interaction between rollover risk and default risk are whether a firm suffers from declining profitability and has poor credit  additionally  rollover risk s impact on default probability is stronger during periods when credit market conditions are tighter   c  2016 elsevier inc  all rights reserved  
 effectiveness of product return prevention instruments  empirical evidence the convenience and ease of online shopping reduce consumers  risk perceptions  which encourages the continued growth of online retailing but also may force online retailers to deal with expensive and excessively high product return rates  despite efforts by e commerce management practitioners and scholars to identify determinants of customer product return behavior  scarce research investigates the effectiveness of instruments designed explicitly to reduce customers  actual return rates  drawing on risk theory  this article tests the influence of three important instruments on product return prevention  three separate field experiments among customers of a well known european online retailer reveal  unexpectedly  that the use of a money back guarantee increases product returns  whereas product reviews decrease the product return rate  the provision of free return labels has no influence on customer product return behavior  this article concludes with some managerial and theoretical implications of these results  
 effects of anti corruption on firm performance  evidence from a quasi natural experiment in china we investigate the causal effects of anti corruption on firm performance based on a quasi natural experiment  since 2013  china has implemented a national anti corruption policy  and the central commission for discipline inspection has conducted five rounds of inspection on corruption covering all provinces  difference in differences estimations show that although the anti corruption campaign significantly improves firm performance of central state owned enterprises  soes   such endeavor significantly reduces firm performance of non state owned enterprises  non soes   thus  the corruption could a double edged sword and act as  sand the wheel  in central soes but  greasing the wheel  in non soes  this paper provides critical insights and a serious challenge for regulators in china   c  2017 published by elsevier inc  
 effects of extent and diversity of alliancing on innovation  the moderating role of firm newness the purpose of this paper is to show the varying effects of alliance portfolio size and heterogeneity on innovation in biotechnology firms  previous literature has indicated that the number and heterogeneity of partners in an alliance portfolio might have positive effects on innovativeness  yet  engaging in multiple and heterogeneous collaborations also raises managerial costs and complexity levels disproportionally  potentially causing detrimental performance effects  analysis of a unique panel dataset suggests that engaging in many alliances generally has a positive influence on a firm s innovation output  furthermore  maintaining diverse alliance portfolios and a high extent of alliancing jointly affects a firm s innovation output negatively  by additionally showing that younger firms benefit disproportionally from both alliance portfolio diversity and size  this study provides a more nuanced view of alliancing effects

 emerging market firms  internationalization  how do firms  inward activities affect their outward activities  research summary  in this study we examine how an emerging market firm s inward international activities  inward activities  are related to its outward international activities  outward activities  by focusing on the role of the firm s gain from its inward activities  on the one hand  drawing upon the organizational learning perspective  we propose that a firm s gain from inward activities may facilitate its outward activities through improving its resource fungibility  on the other hand  we draw upon the prospect theory to propose that a firm s gain from inward activities may hinder its outward activities by discouraging the firm s top managers from taking risks that are inherent in outward activities  with detailed data from a sample of manufacturing firms in china  we find empirical support for both lines of arguments managerial summary  are emerging market firms with higher inward gain more likely to engage in outward internationalization activities  we argue that it depends upon how a firm uses its gain from inward activities  if the firm can improve its resource fungibility  particularly organizational resource fungibility  from its inward gain  it is more likely to engage in outward activities  if the firm cannot improve its resource fungiblity  the answer is no  our findings suggest that for emerging market firms  internationalization is not just a path toward new markets  instead  it reflects how these firms exploit and explore what they have learned from their interactions with foreign firms at home in foreign markets  therefore  managers must think more strategically on developing  organizational  resource fungibility from their inward activities  copyright  c  2017 john wiley   sons  ltd

 employee bargaining power  inter firm competition  and equity based compensation we develop a model to illustrate that equity based compensation for non executive employees and product market decisions are related  when the product market is competitive and employees have low bargaining power  the unique equilibrium is for each firm s owners to offer equity based compensation to their employees  in this setting  equity based compensation leads to a lower wage rate  which makes each firm more competitive with its rival  however  this unique equilibrium is a prisoner s dilemma for the firms  original owners  our results are consistent with several empirical regularities and provide predictions on when firms will offer equity based compensation to their employees   c  2017 elsevier b v  all rights reserved  
 employee based innovation in organizations  overcoming strategic risks from opportunism and governance research summaryemployees performing everyday tasks frequently acquire valuable new ideas and knowledge  our formal analysis studies how organizations can benefit from employee driven innovation by using incentives to overcome strategic risk from opportunism and governance  we use a game theory framework to analyze the strategic interactions involved and identify incentives under which valuable ideas will be revealed without appropriation  in equilibrium   our analysis considers both the short run and the long run  where governance can be adjusted to maximize expected future innovation profits  innovation value  frequency  governance quality  and employee contestation costs are shown to play a salient role in determining the innovation incentives and equilibrium  overall  our analysis and results provide a number of insights on how organizations can overcome frictions from strategic innovation risks to more fully mobilize their innovation potential and knowledge based resources  managerial summaryidea theft can occur in organizations when employees find it beneficial to present a valuable idea of another employee as theirs  if employees engaged in everyday tasks believe this will likely happen or that they will not be rewarded enough  they may not reveal them  we analyze the design of appropriate innovation rewards that will prevent stealing of innovative ideas and allow organizations to capture value from employee driven innovation  we show that governance quality  innovation value  and costs related to contestation play a salient role in determining appropriate innovation rewards and the organization s innovation capacity  flatter organizations can deter idea theft more effectively and need to pay lower innovation rewards  in the long term  we show that all organizations can become more innovative by adjusting their governance quality and reducing employee contestation costs  further  the ones with higher innovation potential and contestation costs will move toward higher quality governance and seek more entrepreneurial employees  as this raises long run innovation profits  copyright  c  2017 strategic management society

 encouraging environmental sustainability through gender  a micro foundational approach using linguistic gender marking while studies show that organizational diversity is beneficial to their practice of environmental sustainability  we know very little about the effect that the gender of an individual director can have on sustainability practice  in this empirical paper  we employ a micro foundational approach to examine whether the number of women on an organization s board of directors has a direct effect on its attitude towards environmental sustainability  regardless of the national culture in which the organization is located  culture in this study is measured through grammatical gender marking  a unique approach to measuring women oriented cultural effects  previous studies show that certain cultures have more gender roles than others do  which in turn affect general and organizational behavior in that society  grammatical gender marking enables us to study the impact of gender of the individual director on the organization s attitude towards environmental sustainability across cultures  by empirically examining data from 71 countries  sampling 4500 organizations for multiple years and industries  our findings show that organizations become significantly more proactive in environmental sustainability with the appointment of even one woman to the board of directors  regardless of the local culture  we further show that the organization s level of disclosure regarding its sustainability activities increases with the number of women on the board of directors  our data also show a significantly negative relationship between various gender based language indices and the presence of women on the board of directors  in cultures defined by a language that has clear grammatical gender markings  there is a tendency to appoint fewer women to boards of directors  thereby influencing indirectly the organization s attitude towards environmental sustainability  
 endogeneity of return parameters and portfolio selection  an analysis on implied covariances the paper presents a method to measure forward looking covariance risk for any two assets even when the explicit market for barter trades does not exist  we argue that the terms of trade in any barter exchanges also follow a martingale process with no arbitrage  we then compute various bivariate martingale probabilities for different assets to value all possible pseudo exchange options  this makes it possible for one to compute implied covariances embedded in the value of any exchange options as in margrabe  1978   the paper also discusses how these recoverable implied return distribution parameters can impact portfolio choice  
 endogenous versus exogenous generic reference pricing for pharmaceuticals in this paper we carry out a vertical differentiation duopoly model applied to pharmaceutical markets to analyze how endogenous and exogenous generic reference pricing influence competition between generic and branded drugs producers  unlike the literature  we characterize for the exogenous case the equilibrium prices for all feasible relevant reference prices  competition is enhanced after the introduction of a reference pricing system  we also compare both reference pricing systems on welfare grounds  assuming two different objective functions for health authorities   i  standard social welfare and  ii  gross consumer surplus net of total pharmaceutical expenditures  we show that regardless of the objective function  health authorities will never choose endogenous reference pricing  when health authorities are paternalistic  the exogenous reference price that maximizes standard social welfare is such that the price of the generic drug is the reference price while the price of the branded drug is higher than the reference price  when health authorities are not paternalistic  the optimal exogenous reference price is such that the price of the branded drug is the reference price while the price of the generic drug is lower than the reference price

 entrepreneurial motivation and self employment  evidence from expectancy theory one effect of the economic crisis on the business world has been the drastic reduction in staff and this in turn highlights the need for self employment and the creation of new companies to establish a solid industrial fabric to support the creation of wealth  employment and welfare  in this context  the aim of this research is to confirm a theoretical model based on expectancy theory to explain self employment in terms of an individual s motivation and ability to start a business  because of the lack of additional information about entrepreneurial motivation  we conducted a field investigation of spanish self employed workers who had established a manufacturing company during the last three years  the results confirm the supposition that expectancy  instrumentality and valence enhance entrepreneurial motivation  this study concludes that businesses are created not only by those with the ability and aptitude to do so  but also by those with the motivation  
 entrepreneurial orientation our theory of competitive advantage  namely the theory of entrepreneurial rent  posits that the firm s entrepreneurial orientation  their alertness  agility  absorptivity  and proactive adaptability  is a source of competitive advantage  the firm s entrepreneurial orientation sustained by the entrepreneurial incentives continually updates and enriches the management logics that enhance the execution of the business model mechanism wherein lies the firm s competitive advantage  the business model mechanism constituting the management logics  core resources  value opportunities  and value activities sustains the firm value creation and appropriation  superior execution of the business model mechanism sustained by the firm s entrepreneurial orientation provides a sustainable competitive advantage  the entrepreneurial incentives are at the heart of our theory of competitive advantage  the superior execution of the business model mechanism is sustained by the entrepreneurial incentives  in that the business model execution is enhanced by the management logics that are continually updated with the firm s entrepreneurial orientation  and the firm s entrepreneurial orientation is sustained by the entrepreneurial incentives  
 entrepreneurial orientation  legitimation  and new venture performance research summarywe integrate research on entrepreneurial orientation and new venture legitimacy  to create value from an entrepreneurial orientation  firms need to possess necessary resources and capabilities  which new ventures often lack due to their liability of newness  we posit that legitimation helps overcome these constraints by enabling new ventures to acquire necessary resources and develop essential capabilities  and argue that entrepreneurial orientation and legitimation jointly enhance new venture performance  we analyzed data on 149 new ventures and found support for this argument  this study opens new research avenues by extending and incorporating explanations and predictions of entrepreneurial orientation and legitimation  two areas that largely have been considered as independent of each other  managerial summaryin the absence of a clear connection between legitimacy and economic returns  entrepreneurs and managers may not give strategic priority to legitimation  we find that new ventures with an entrepreneurial orientation as demonstrated by innovative  proactive  and risk taking decisions and behaviors can achieve superior performance if they also actively undertake legitimation efforts to meet stakeholders  cognitive  regulative  and normative expectations  this study suggests that neglecting legitimation as an important competitive tool may be a greater mistake than previously has been realized  especially for new ventures with an entrepreneurial orientation  copyright  c  2017 strategic management society 
 entrepreneurial orientation  the dimensions  shared effects in explaining firm performance we shed new light on the structure of the relationship between entrepreneurial orientation  eo  and firm performance and how this relationship varies across contexts  using commonality analysis  we decompose the variance in performancein terms of the effects of innovativeness  proactiveness  and risk takinginto parts that are attributable to unique variations in these dimensions  unique effects  and those attributable to covariation between these dimensions  shared effects   by demonstrating the empirical relevance of unique  bilaterally shared  and commonly shared effects in a heterogeneous sample of low tech  high tech  and multi sector firms  we consolidate existing conceptualizations of eo and propose an extension of the extant theoretical views of the construct  
 entrepreneurial intention constraint model  a comparative analysis among post graduate management students in india  singapore and malaysia although literature on entrepreneurship has increasingly focused on intention based models  not much emphasis has been laid on understanding the combined effect of contextual and situational factors along with support of university environment on the formation of entrepreneurial intention among students  in an effort to make up for this shortfall  by taking theory of planned behavior as basic framework  the present study seeks to understand the influence of three of the most important factors  viz   a  endogenous barriers   b  exogenous environment  and  c  university environment and support on the entrepreneurial intention among management students  the study sample consisted of 1 097 students  wherein 526 students were from india  252 from singapore  and 319 were from malaysia  the results indicates that along with positive attitude and perceived behavioral control that directly influences entrepreneurial intention  university environment and support and exogenous environment also have an indirect but significant impact on shaping of entrepreneurial intention among students  with this  it was found that exogenous environment was found to have a negative relationship with both attitude towards behavior and perceived behavioral control for all three countries

 entrepreneurship and financial inclusion through the lens of instrumental freedoms this article investigates the interrelated nature of instrumental freedoms and how they combine to engender financial inclusion among low income entrepreneurs  drawing from sen s capabilities approach  we emphasize a need for understanding the freedoms associated with institutional arrangements and the complex causal processes that lead to financial inclusion among micro entrepreneurs  we perform a fuzzy set qualitative comparative analysis of 19 countries in latin america and the caribbean  the findings indicate four causal combinations for financial inclusion  our findings indicate that no single instrumental freedom is necessary for financial inclusion  it does not necessarily depend on the provision of microfinance and that political freedom is an important peripheral condition for inclusion  this allows us to question some of the assumptions about how microfinance operates amid a set of complex institutional instrumental freedoms  
 entrepreneurship at regional level  temporary and neighborhood effects this paper analyzes the spatial nature of entrepreneurship at nutsiii  lately  academic studies are including the relation between incipient entrepreneurs and geography  in some cases  this relation is considered as unidirectional insofar as the decision to become an entrepreneur can be highly influenced by geographical location  beyond the cultural and social boundaries that affect the entrepreneur as an individual  there are spatial characteristics that provide advantages of location for some industries  while several studies highlight the role of location and geography as aspects that have an impact on entrepreneurial activity  the externalities generated by such aspects are not considered in empirical work  the aim of this paper is to check how avoiding considering location can have an effect on the results of entrepreneurship research  our results point that both location and temporary effects have a significant impact on entrepreneurship research results  thus  it is important to use a temporary and spatial methodological approach in entrepreneurship research to avoid bias  
 environmental behavior and mnes  a strategy pulled by stakeholder engagement this research attempts to examine how multinational enterprises  mnes  from regulated and non regulated industries shape their environmental strategies with regard to environmental disclosure and performance  results reveal that regulated  non regulated  mnes display worse  better  environmental performance levels and disclose less  more  environmental information than mnes operating in non regulated  regulated  environments  we argue that this strategy is set as an answer to cope with legitimacy problems faced by mnes as well as to respond to increased demands from stakeholder groups  we contend that our findings may contribute to existing literature and be of relevance for practitioners  copyright  c  2017 john wiley   sons  ltd and erp environment 
 environmental entrepreneurship and interorganizational arrangements  a model of social benefit market creation research summarysocial benefit markets  such as those for carbon trading  are becoming increasingly popular for combating complex social and environmental problems  however  their unique characteristics pose substantial challenges to market creation and require novel entrepreneurial approaches  integrating the entrepreneurship literature with that of management information systems  we conceptualize social benefit markets as a new type of interorganizational arrangement and develop a model of social benefit market creation  first  we argue that a core entrepreneurial collective  comprising a plurality of actors from government  business  and social movements  is essential  second  we elaborate a six phase process through which the interests of entrepreneurs are aligned and inscribed in a market artifact and the market is formed  the model is illustrated with reference to the western climate initiative s carbon market creation efforts  managerial summarycarbon markets have become a popular strategy for reducing greenhouse gas emissions  with similar market based solutions being proposed for other social and environmental challenges  we refer to these new structures as social benefit markets  social benefit market creation is a complex undertaking that will require novel entrepreneurial approaches and new interorganizational information systems  in an effort to reduce some of this complexity  we propose a model to explain how entrepreneurs from government  business  and social movements must work collectively to build social benefit markets  we further elaborate a six phase process through which entrepreneurs are able to align their diverse interests and create a stable market artifact  for managers from all sectors  our work offers actionable guidance for forming collective ventures that deliver real social benefits  copyright  c  2017 strategic management society 
 environmental goods valuations for social sustainability  a conceptual framework there is growing interest in the environmental impact of organizational activities  this exploratory study introduces the need to integrate economic market and non market valuations for social sustainability in organizations  while organizations have not reached this integration  the potential to help in development and the introduction of social sustainability is significant  the methodology includes an extensive research into economic market and non market valuation literature for social sustainability  this paper integrates a new approach to the current academic literature highlighting social aspects of sustainability within the supply chain and specifically in reverse logistics  the literature review led to the development of a framework guiding and simplifying these efforts  practical situations of environmental goods valuations of social sustainability in reverse logistics are provided as an illustration  using organizational supply chains and reverse logistics as an example  the application of various tools is presented using an environmental goods valuation framework  the integration of these topics aid researchers  policy makers  and practitioners  the findings make a contribution to the strategic organizational justification  performance measurement and sustainability literature by further integrating environmental goods valuation tools  models  theory and practices  the paper includes the development of propositions to be addressed in future research  
 environmental performance and the market for corporate assets research summary  scholars and policy makers have tended to assume that asset sales have a negative effect on stakeholders  but quantitative evidence to inform the debate has been scarce  in our research  we explored one way such sales could be beneficial  by facilitating the transfer of specialized capabilities used for environmental improvement  employing quantitative data from a longitudinal sample of u s  manufacturers  we find evidence consistent with the transfer of capabilities to or from acquired assets  our results inform theories of ownership change and the conditional flow of capabilities among operations  they provide evidence as well of the existence of environmental capabilities  for policy makers they provide needed evidence and insight on the merits of regulations designed to limit asset sales managerial summary  it is often assumed that acquisitions harm environmental performance  acquisition leads to greater emphasis on efficiency  while focusing on environmental performance is driven by managerial discretion  we propose instead that acquisitions might lead to improvement in environmental outcomes  the key is in knowing where to look for improvement  we studied thousands of facility level acquisitions and find that when a clean firm buys a facility from a dirtier firm  that facility s environmental performance improved  when a dirtier firm buys from a cleaner one  however  it is the dirtier firm s other facilities in the same industry of the target that improved  these results  along with extensions we undertook  suggest that managers and policy makers should view acquisitions as conduits rather than impediments in transferring environmental capabilities  copyright  c  2017 john wiley   sons  ltd  
 epideictic rhetoric born digital  evolution of the letter of recommendation genre the letter of recommendation  lor  plays a significant role in the application process for many professional positions  offering descriptive rather than quantitative information from a third party about an individual s potential fit within the hiring organization  such letters  however  increasingly appear online  emphasizing existing problems within the genre and creating others involving trust  reliability  and confidentiality  typically  the response has been that such digitization of the lor minimizes its significance or standardizes it  this article analyzes the digital lor genre as an exemplar of epideictic rhetoric situated within a perelmanian framework and demonstrates how the digital lor operates rhetorically  enhancing the adherence between candidate  writer  audience  and institutional values and providing a means of evaluating candidate fit  the article also offers a rhetorical heuristic that captures how audiences can more fruitfully read the epideictic  digital lor  thereby demonstrating how to optimize the digital platform s benefits and still use the lor to its best rhetorical advantage  
 equilibrium analysis of markup pricing strategies under power imbalance and supply chain competition this study uses a game theory based analytical model to examine the consequences of two markup pricing schemes  fixed dollar markup and percentage markup  in a supply chain to chain competition setting with power imbalance between dominant retailers  our results show that the equilibrium pricing strategy depends on the level of supply chain to chain competition  specifically  if the level of supply chain competition is not sufficiently high  the equilibrium pricing strategy for the two retailers will be the one in which both retailers choose to adopt the percentage markup pricing policy  i e   the  pp  strategy  unfortunately  this equilibrium will lead the retailers into the prisoner s dilemma in some common situations  however  if the level of competition is extremely high  the equilibrium pricing strategy will be that where the leader  retailer 1  chooses the percentage markup pricing policy and the follower  retailer 2  selects the fixed dollar markup pricing policy  i e   the  pf  strategy  this equilibrium pricing strategy always hurts manufacturer 1  but might benefit manufacturer 2 when the level of competition exceeds a certain threshold  from the perspective of the end consumers  they prefer the level of competition to be kept below a certain threshold such that the  pp  strategy becomes the equilibrium pricing strategy because this equilibrium leads to the lowest retail prices  furthermore  our results show that retailer 1 suffers a first mover disadvantage even under a linear demand curve  and this situation cannot be alleviated by abandoning its price leader position to share power equally with retailer 2  
 equilibrium informed trading with relative performance measurement this article analyzes the informative trading of professional money managers within a rational expectations equilibrium model in which managers care about their performance relative to their peer group  i find that the existence of uninformed managers causes informed managers with relative performance concerns to trade less informatively  engendering less informative prices  when managers are differentially informed  they need to forecast the average performance based on private signals  and each manager may place more weight on the private signal if the signal provides good information about the average performance  the price aggregates those signals and thus becomes more informative  
 equity premium prediction  the role of economic and statistical constraints in this paper  we show that the equity premium is predictable out of sample when we use a predictive regression that conditions on a large set of economic fundamentals  subject to   1  economic constraints on the sign of coefficients and return forecasts  and  2  statistical constraints imposed by shrinkage estimation  equity premium predictability delivers a certainty equivalent return of about 2 7  per year over the benchmark for a mean variance investor  our predictive framework outperforms a large group of competing models that also condition on economic fundamentals  as well as models that condition on technical indicators   c  2016 elsevier b v  all rights reserved  
 error management culture and turnover intent among food and beverage employees in deluxe hotels  the mediating effect of job satisfaction this study aimed to investigate interrelationships among organizational error management culture  emc   job satisfaction  and turnover intent among food and beverage in a deluxe hotel  this study also investigated the mediating effects of employees  job satisfaction on the relationships between organizational emc and turnover intent  a total of 321 food and beverage employees in south korea participated in the study using a self administered questionnaire  confirmatory factor analysis and structural equation modeling were used to examine the hypothesized relationships between the constructs  the results showed a positive relationship between organizational emc and employee job satisfaction  an employees  job satisfaction reduces his or her turnover intent  another important finding of this study was that job satisfaction appears to play a mediating role between organizational emc and turnover intent  these findings have important implications for controlling and facilitating emc in the hotel industry  this study implies that active emc can be an important variable that can effectively manage turnover intent  it is important to build a system that can facilitate communication in the case of error occurrence and prevent the recurrence of the same error by sharing experience of and knowledge about errors  moreover  a system that can instantly respond to and analyze an error situation should be developed and implemented  it is important to systematically manage errors as part of a firm s culture through the appropriate use of emc  thus  it might be useful to identify and prioritize emc specifically in the hotel industry  which could lead to higher job satisfaction  lower turnover intent  and higher profitability  
 estimating group level relationships  general recommendations and considerations for the use of intraclass correlation coefficients in this investigation  we argue for why and how available intraclass correlation coefficients and other types of reliability estimates can be employed as sample based reliability estimates within primary and meta analytic studies when relationships between group level phenomena are of interest  group level correlations and reliability estimates were obtained from 46 studies examining organizational climate performance relationships  we illustrate how the group level reliability estimates can be used to correct correlations for predictor and criterion unreliability  procedures are presented for computing the sampling variances of individually corrected correlations that account for sampling error in the group level reliability estimates  support was found for the conservative nature of meta analytic parameter estimates when group level reliability information is sample based as opposed to assumed population values  in addition  our analyses indicated that conclusions about substantive relationships between group level variables can change based on availability of sample based reliabilities within both primary and meta analytic studies  results from this study suggest that researchers should rely on sample based meta analytic procedures when examining the generalizability of group level relationships  this study also demonstrates the importance of using all available reliability information and accounting for sampling error in the reliability estimates when conducting meta analyses at the group level of analysis  this study breaks ground by systematically examining the use of intraclass correlation coefficients as reliability estimates within group level meta analytic studies  furthermore  illustrative analyses provide guidance to primary and meta analytic researchers in regard to how to correct group level correlations for unreliability in the predictor  criterion  or both whenever and in whatever proportions the artifact information is available  
 estimating the value of proximity to water  when ceteris really is paribus proximity to water is appreciated by households  hedonic analyses that try to measure the value of this amenity are potentially biased by omitted variables because locations close to water may be selected by households with higher incomes who construct more luxury houses  because it is difficult to observe all the relevant characteristics  the coefficient for proximity to water may be biased upwards  we circumvent this problem by exploiting a specific characteristic of the dutch system of planned residential development  often a number of exactly similar houses are constructed close to each other  by comparing the values of such identical houses  we can measure the effect of proximity to water under almost ideal circumstances  introduction of these fixed effects lowers the estimated impact of this amenity  thereby confirming the conjectured presence of an omitted variable bias  
 estimating volatility persistence under a brexit vote structural break we model volatility dynamics and explore volatility persistence under a supposed brexit vote structural break  we find that following the brexit vote  volatility persistence increased significantly in the stock markets but decreased in the foreign exchange market  however we uncover similar patterns in the dynamics of volatility across both markets  with the post brexit vote news effect generally contributing less to volatility persistence  our findings suggest that the increased post brexit vote volatility persistence is mainly driven by rising forecast variance from previous periods and that investors may have already priced in the news from the brexit vote  therefore  a brexit vote structural break may be irrelevant in modelling volatility dynamics   c  2017 elsevier inc  all rights reserved  
 estimation of consumer willingness to pay for social responsibility in fruit and vegetable products  a cross country comparison using a choice experiment choice experiments are used to assess consumer preferences and willingness to pay  wtp  for different food attributes worldwide  these studies also include credence attributes which are the product attributes that are not immediately observable to consumers without appropriate information and labelling  such as animal welfare  food safety  and social responsibility  although choice experiment application has considered many of these attributes  studies focused on social responsibility are scant  building on previous work comparing developed and developing countries  this paper focuses on wtp estimation for social responsibility  surveys of fruit and vegetable consumers were conducted in united kingdom  uk   japan  india  and indonesia in 2015  results indicate wtp for an increase from minimum to improved standard for social responsibility ranges from 16  to 30   median   and 6  to 26   median  from improved to a high standard  premiums vary between countries but  overall  demonstrate the significant importance of social responsibility consideration in consumer choices  significant differences on wtp were observed between japan and other countries  as well as between uk and indonesia for the improved social responsibility standard  and across uk  indonesia  and india for the high standard  findings contribute to increasing understanding of consumer preferences across countries  revealing significant preference heterogeneity towards social responsibility

 ethical qualities in consumption  towards a theory of care this article seeks to develop an empirically grounded theorization of care  current care theory tends to be conceived along philosophical  psychological and labour dimensions  with much of the literature focusing on caring labour and  therefore  invoking a productionist orientation  by contrast  our focus on consumption suggests a reorientation in conceptualizing care to more fully apprehend the nuances of care neglected in a consumption context  we draw from tronto s phases of care in arguing that caregiving is not necessarily only an activity involving one s labour  through interviews  we examine how and what we consume manifests care and caring  we theorize care in consumption as a circular and dynamic process involving the combination of awareness  responsibility and action  this enhanced understanding of care could facilitate improved market exchanges and relationships between different stakeholders  
 ethics  faith  and profit  exploring the motives of the us fair trade social entrepreneurs although fair trade has grown exponentially in the u s  in recent years  we do not have a clear understanding of why small u s  firms choose to participate in it  to answer this question  we use a qualitative case study approach and grounded theory analysis to explore the motivations of 35 small fair trade businesses  we find that shared values  ethical  religious  or business  and the desire to help others  altruism   often triggered by a critical incident  lead social entrepreneurs to found and sustain fair trade businesses  the relationship between shared values and engagement in fair trade and the relationship between altruism and engagement in fair trade are strengthened by four motivating factors  direct relationships with producers  support for social causes  the desire for the preservation of craftsmanship  and the desire to share aesthetic products  these links are strengthened by four facilitating factors  which make fair trade engagement easier   the acquisition of business knowledge  family member involvement in the firm  assistance from faith communities  and assistance from the fair trade community  additional analysis reveals three types of fair trade social entrepreneurs   ethics first   or ethical  entrepreneurs  primarily motivated by human rights and social justice concerns   faith first   or faithful  fair traders  motivated primarily by their religious faith  and  business first   or benevolent  businesspeople  motivated by what they perceive to be an opportunity to build a successful business while simultaneously doing  good  and helping others  
 ethnic identity  consumer ethnocentrism  and purchase intentions among bi cultural ethnic consumers   divided loyalties  or  dual allegiance   consumer ethnocentrism has been studied extensively in international marketing in the context of one s country of residence  this paper investigates for the first time the notion of  dual ethnocentrism   which may be encountered among ethnic consumers who have an allegiance toward  or divided loyalties between  two countries  one with which they are ethnically linked  or  home   and one where they presently live and work  or  host   the study examines the relationship between ethnic identity  dual ethnocentrism  and purchase intentions among ethnic consumers  a market segment of growing importance in research and practice  the analysis focuses on differences in the respondents  home  and host related ethnocentrism and finds that indeed ethnocentric feelings and their effects differ depending on the country of reference  in this light  the study suggests that ethnocentrism is a considerably more complex construct than previously thought  advances our understanding of ethnicity and ethnocentrism  and discusses the theoretical and managerial implications arising from dual ethnocentrism

 evaluating sovereign disaster risk finance strategies  a framework this paper proposes a framework for ex ante evaluation of sovereign disaster risk finance instruments available to governments for funding disaster losses  the framework can be used by governments to help choose between different financial instruments  or between different combinations of instruments  to achieve appropriate and financially efficient strategies to fund disaster losses  in doing so  the framework takes into account the risk of disasters  economic conditions and political constraints  the paper discusses the framework in the context of a hypothetical country  with parameters selected to represent a disaster prone small island state  the paper shows how a mix of instruments can be chosen to minimise the economic opportunity cost given the underlying disaster risk faced and prevailing economic and financial conditions  
 evaluating the use of internet search volumes for time series modeling of sales in the video game industry internet search volumes have been successfully adopted for time series analysis of different phenomena  this empirical paper evaluates the feasibility of search volumes in modeling of weekly video game sales  building on the theoretical concepts of product life cycle  diffusion  and electronic word of mouth advertisement  the empirical analysis concentrates on the hypothesized granger causality between sales and search volumes  by using a bivariate vector autoregression model with a dataset of nearly a hundred video games  only a few games exhibit such causality to either direction  when correlations are present  these rather occur instantaneously  the current weekly amount of sales tends to mirror the current weekly amount of searches  according to the results  search volumes contribute only a limited additional statistical power for forecasting  however  besides this statistical limitation  the presented evaluation reveals a number of other limitations for use in practical marketing and advertisement foresight  internet search volumes continue to provide a valuable empirical instrument  but the value should not be exaggerated for time series modeling of video game sales  
 evaluating vpin as a trigger for single stock circuit breakers we study if vpin  easley et al   2012a  is an efficient advance indicator of toxicity induced liquidity crises and related sharp price movements  we find that high vpin readings rarely signal abnormal illiquidity  and very occasionally anticipate large intraday price changes leading to actual trading halts  we find significant differences in illiquidity and price impact between vpin identified toxic and non toxic halts  but they tend to vanish when we control for ex ante realized volatility  we conclude that the capacity of vpin to anticipate truly toxic events is limited   c  2017 elsevier b v  all rights reserved

 exchange rate pass through in emerging countries  do the inflation environment  monetary policy regime and central bank behavior matter  in this paper  we estimate the exchange rate pass through  erpt  to import and consumer prices for a sample of 14 emerging countries over the 1994q1 2015q3 period  to this end  we augment the traditional bivariate relationship between the nominal effective exchange rate and inflation by accounting for monetary stability proxied by the inflation environment  monetary policy regime and central bank behavior  we show that both the level and volatility of inflation  as well as adopting an inflation target or the transparency of monetary policy decisions clearly reduce erpt to consumer prices  however  uncertainty about domestic monetary policy seems less relevant in explaining the pass through to the price of imports   c  2017 elsevier ltd  all rights reserved  
 experiential tourist shopping value  adding causality to value dimensions and testing their subjectivity previous literature on consumer behavior has tackled the experiential approach in retailing services in depth  however  most of the previous studies have concentrated on the simultaneous but not concatenated effects of value dimensions on satisfaction and or loyalty  furthermore  tourists  shopping behavior remains an underdeveloped area of study from the experiential perspective  this work explores experiential tourist shopping value  aiming to  a  explain tourists  loyalty to retailers by adding causality to experiential dimensions and  b  prove the subjectivity of these values  after a diachronic and synchronic review of the literature on experiential shopping value  a structural model with a chain of effects consisting of product quality  service quality  self esteem and shopping enjoyment on loyalty  and a multidimensional index as a second order model were built with partial least squares and tested on a purposive sample of 374 tourists in valencia  spain   our findings revealed a sequential approach to tourists  shopping experiences where utilitarian values led to social and hedonic ones  all of which were antecedents of loyalty to retailers  furthermore  the index showed differences by gender and nationality  although our results are context specific  they add to the value creation process as they show a sequence of effects  and a fully subjective value provision  which changes according to demographics  the originality of this work is that it contributes to the suitability of the experiential paradigm in explaining tourists  shopping behavior by promoting interest in this specific  underdeveloped target area  and also by adding causality and proving the subjectivity of experiential value dimensions  
 explaining mandate loss of regional headquarters  the difference between full and partial loss the fluidity of regional headquarters  rhq  mandates is a core aspect of disaggregating hq activities in mncs  while slicing  of global value chains has received attention in previous research  the parallel disaggregation of management activities has not  our longitudinal study of 374 rhq between 1998 and 2010 redresses this omission by asking why rhq lose their mandates  we apply the concept of absorptive capacity and find two different explanatory mechanisms for full and partial mandate loss driven by rhq specific capabilities and location specific capabilities  full mandate loss is associated with deficient rhq specific capabilities and realised absorptive capacity  by contrast  partial mandate loss is driven by an rhq s lack of the location specific capabilities to respond to local changes  leading to removal of mandates for some subunits only  the distinction between full and partial loss offers a more nuanced and granular explanation of how geographic regions of mncs are composed  
 explanatory factors for efficiency in the use of social networking sitesthe case of organic food products in some markets  organic foods face problems such as consumer misinformation and confusion  high prices compared to conventional equivalents  or few points of sale  the answers to these problems include information and communication technologies  particularly social networking sites  sns   given their potential for conveying information and connecting customers and suppliers at less cost  it would be useful to ascertain the psychology of social media use and which factors determine sns efficiency among organic producers  this study of the efficiency of sns use in two strategic sectors for spainolive oil and wineused data envelopment analysis and  in a second stage  qualitative comparative analysis  qca  to detect the contextual variables that explain the highest efficiency indices  the results showed that the more market oriented sector  wine  has a higher average efficiency of sns use and pointed to the following explanatory factors  snss mentioned on corporate websites  number of employees  the manager s educational background  and length of sns use  
 explicit versus implicit country stereotypes as predictors of product preferences  insights from the stereotype content model drawing on the stereotype content model  scm   we investigate the impact of both explicit and implicit country stereotypes on consumer preferences  in study 1  we show that the competence dimension of the scm  measured both explicitly and implicitly  drives purchase intention by positively influencing brand affect  in study 2  we disentangle further the role of explicit and implicit stereotypes and show that explicit judgments of country competence are better predictors of deliberate consumer choices  whereas implicit judgments of country warmth dominate spontaneous choice  managerially our findings indicate that sole reliance on explicit stereotypes may result in an incomplete picture of consumers  responses to country of origin cues  
 exploration  exploitation  and variability  competition for primacy revisited this study examines how exploration and exploitation contribute to variability in organizational performance and how this variability influences competitions for primacy  that is  contexts in which the ability to generate exceptionally high levels of performance is a key success factor  the results of simulation analyses conducted using the nk model  the mutual learning model  and the multiarmed bandit model all show that while exploration introduces more internal variability in organizations  exploitation tends to increase the variability in performance between different organizations  variability and uniqueness in relation to one s competitors  brought about by a single minded focus on exploitation  is found to be advantageous in a race to finish first  in contrast  in contexts where avoiding especially low performance is the key consideration  exploration is found to be relatively more beneficial  these results suggest a need for a more nuanced understanding of the relationships between exploration  exploitation  and organizational risk taking  
 exploring corporations  dialogue about csr in the digital era in this paper  we examined how companies are employing new media to engage in dialogue with their stakeholders about corporate social responsibility  csr  related matters  through a qualitative theory building study conducted in three stages over a period of 2 years  we discovered that corporations with reputations for csr have built virtual spaces for dialogue about csr  but that these spaces remain empty of dialogue  our theory building model highlights how the mix of four dialogue processes  i e  directing  moderating  building open scripts  and crowd sourcing multi dialogue  may allow companies to create open dialogue about csr initiatives and avoid leaving these spaces empty  contributions for csr studies are discussed

 exploring international differences in inflation dynamics standard closed economy dsge models have difficulty replicating the persistence of inflation  we use a multicountry dataset to establish some empirical regularities on persistence and volatility of aggregate consumer prices for 135 countries since 1993  we find both persistence and volatility to be low  high  in developed  developing  countries relative to the full sample average  this pattern is also observed in low  high  inflation countries  we then employ a two country dsge framework to investigate the extent to which structural open economy features  such as incomplete exchange rate pass through  the existence of nontraded goods  and international financial market incompleteness  can help in replicating the persistence and volatility of consumer prices  our simulation results indicate that the model can replicate the degree of inflation persistence seen in the data for both developed and developing countries  but cannot generate the low levels of volatility observed in developed economies   c  2017 elsevier ltd  all rights reserved  
 exploring moderators in the relationship between cognitive adaptability and entrepreneurial intention  findings from south africa we build on the work of haynie and shepherd  entrepreneurship theory and practice  33  695 714  2009   who introduced five dimensions of cognitive adaptability in an entrepreneurial context  and urban  management dynamics  21  16 33  2012a   who explored the relationship of cognitive adaptability with entrepreneurial intention  there is evidence that cognitive adaptability represents a link in the development of intentions and we empirically answer the call to explore moderators of this relationship  we analyse data collected from 602 potential entrepreneurs in south africa using structural equation modelling  the results indicate that three cognitive adaptability dimensions  namely goal orientation  metacognitive experience  and metacognitive choice  have a positive relationship with entrepreneurial intention  level of education  age  gender and entrepreneurial type were tested as moderators as they represent personal level variables related to both cognitive adaptability and entrepreneurial intention in the literature  level of education moderated the relationship between goal orientation and entrepreneurial intention  as well as between metacognitive experience and entrepreneurial intention  the moderating role of gender affected the positive influence of goal orientation on entrepreneurial intention  which was stronger for females  while the negative influence of monitoring was stronger for males and weaker for females  for the entrepreneurial type moderator  the sample was split between 443 necessity driven and 159 opportunity driven potential entrepreneurs  the results revealed that entrepreneurial type moderated the path between metacognitive experience and entrepreneurial intention  which was stronger for necessity than opportunity potential entrepreneurs  the unconventional moderation effects observed in this south african study carry far wider applicability for the development of the theory of cognitive adaptability in an entrepreneurial context  
 exploring the customer s intention to switch firms  the role of customer related antecedents this study examined the customer related antecedents of the customer s intention to switch firms  customer citizenship behavior was a key element in this study  scholars have extensively studied the antecedents of customer citizenship behavior  however  the way that customer citizenship behavior relates to other attitudinal variables and the intention to switch has scarcely been analyzed  the proposed hypotheses were verified using partial least squares variance based structural equation modeling applied to 947 users of beauty care service firms in five countries  the results suggest that customer citizenship behavior is an antecedent of satisfaction  trust  and attitudinal loyalty  two of these variables influence customers  intentions to abandon relationships with the service provider  the implications of these findings enhance managers  and scholars  understanding of the determinants of customers  intentions to switch firms  
 exploring the development of a methodology for scenario use  combining scenario and resource mapping approaches scenarios are tools that help managers to identify critical uncertainties and describe possible futures  they typically focus on an organisation s external environment  scenarios are often used by organisations to explore how their external environment may develop in the future and to consider its impact on their strategy  however  in order to develop strategy  an organisation needs also to consider the internal environment  in terms of its resources and capabilities  such as that presented within the resource based view of the firm  rbv   this paper proposes a novel methodology for enhancing the scenario method through its serial integration with a method from the rbv field  namely that of resource mapping  the methodology provides the ability to support the  rehearsal  of a firm s strategic performance over time by exploring how the firm s resources and capabilities interact with the competitive environment and with the various scenarios  we illustrate our proposed method with an example of its use in a teaching setting by a group of postgraduate students along with a short description of its application within a company  we reflect on the design of the method and the early experiences of using it  the main contribution of the proposed method is that it provides an integrated approach linking scenarios with strategy development and evaluation  the paper ends with suggestions for further research   c  2017 elsevier inc  all rights reserved  
 exploring the double sided effect of information asymmetry and uncertainty in mergers and acquisitions we examine the joint effect of bidder and target information asymmetry and uncertainty on the payment consideration and subsequent wealth effects in a large sample of acquisitions with both listed and private targets  in line with a risk sharing argument  we find that acquisitions of targets characterized by higher uncertainty are more likely to be settled with stock  in contrast  higher target information asymmetry increases the likelihood of a cash payment  consistent with bidders strategically exploiting superior information  acquirers of more opaque targets obtain a larger fraction of total acquisition gains and avoid sharing these gains with target shareholders by offering cash  
 exploring the effectiveness of foreign brand communication  consumer culture ad imagery and brand schema incongruity drawing from international branding literature and schema incongruity research  the present study  a  assesses foreign brand communication effectiveness by juxtaposing three alternative advertising approaches based on local  foreign and global consumer culture imagery  and  b  investigates the mechanism underlying consumers  responses to foreign brand communication  in a 2  foreign brand schema vs  control  x 3  local vs  foreign vs  global ad type  full factorial  between subjects experiment with a consumer sample  we find that ads portraying global consumer culture imagery only moderately violate consumer perceptions of brand foreignness and lead to more favorable ad attitudes  furthermore  moderated mediation analysis shows that when the global ad imagery is meaningfully linked to the foreign brand  perceptions of credibility increase and positively influence ad attitude  however  if consumers cannot make sense of the ad  this effect is reversed and negatively influences subsequent responses  theoretical and managerial implications of the findings are discussed and future research directions identified  
 exploring the framework development status for sustainability in supply chain management  a systematic literature synthesis and future research directions the need to integrate environmental and social aspects into the supply chain has created a debate amongst academicians and researchers on two topics  sustainability and the supply chain  a large number of journals and special volumes are publishing research that carries out a case study or survey  develops a mathematical model or builds a conceptual model framework on sustainable supply chain management  sscm   however  classified analysis of articles that develop a framework on sscm has not been carried out by any researcher  the study thus aims to review sscm framework articles to identify the major contributions and gaps  a total of 92 framework articles on sscm from the sample of 349 over a period of 19years  1998 2016  are structurally analyzed to meet the objectives  the selected literature is categorized by novel or adapted framework  source of framework  framework verification  method used for framework verification and identifying the constructs elements that build the structural framework  analyzing the literature sample using these categories reveals that framework development in the context of sscm is still an area with ample future opportunities  the findings of the study are especially interesting for academicians and practitioners to investigate the critical gaps in the field of sustainable supply chain management frameworks  sscmfs   copyright  c  2017 john wiley   sons  ltd and erp environment

 exploring the unintended negative impact of an ethical climate in competitive environments to attain short term performance  sales managers must motivate their salesforce to close deals  often through use of intra firm competition   at the same time  to maintain long term relationships  they must promote a highly ethical selling environment  which may be incongruent with use of intra firm competition   the present study examines the interactive relationship between competitive psychological climate and ethical psychological climate in predicting salespeople s ethical intentions and behaviors toward customers  a unique dyadic data set is used to predict salesperson ethical intentions and actual salesperson ethical behaviors reported by customers  for ethical intentions  an  executive control  perspective predicts improved ethical intentions toward customers  however  a  depletion  perspective predicts reduced ethical behavior during actual customer interactions  this result is provocative as fostering an ethical climate in conjunction with a competitive climate is found to reduce ethical behaviors in the eyes of customers  a finding clearly counter to what managers intend

 export performance  a focus on discretionary adaptation marketing adaptation strategy has been characterized as a strategic imperative in markets with protectionist and nationalist sentiments  which underscores the need to better understand the effects of adaptation strategy  however  empirical investigations of international marketing strategy have considered mandatory and discretionary adaptations as equivalent  discretionary adaptations  unlike mandatory adaptations  involve choice  thus  they are more relevant to the selection of an international marketing strategy  this article focuses on the direct and conditional effects of discretionary adaptation on export performance  analyzing data from 203 u s  small and medium sized enterprises  the authors find a positive effect of discretionary adaptation on export performance as well as moderating effects of  1  a market characteristic  psychic distance    2  a firm characteristic  international experience   and  3  a product characteristic  product positional advantage   the implications suggest that adaptation strategy may be more advantageous than previously thought  and that researchers should focus on discretionary adaptations when investigating the choice of a relatively standardized versus adapted international marketing strategy  
 export prices  selection into exporting and market size  evidence from china and india this paper empirically analyses the export pricing behaviour of chinese and indian exporters when there is selection into exporting  previous exchange rate pass through estimates that did not take selection into account could be biased if selection into exporting is correlated with pricing strategy  we use 6 digit product level data across high  and low income export destinations over the period 1994 2007 and assess a number of determinants of the degree of pass through of exchange rates to export prices  such as the level of external demand  exporter s wage cost  degree of competition in export markets  currency volatility and the direction of currency movements  we find systematic differences in the pricing strategies of chinese and indian exporters while uncovering a selection bias in exports to high income markets  although the pricing of exports to low income markets is independent of the decision to export  export prices do not increase systematically with the destination market per capita income  and tend to be less sensitive in shipments to advanced nations  export prices of india are sensitive to the volatility of the trade weighted nominal effective exchange rate  neer   indicating heterogeneity in prices to maintain competitiveness  but not in china as volatility is insignificant given a fixed currency system  it is also revealed that a country with a relatively flexible currency regime and arms length trade such as india is more likely to exhibit incomplete pass through  whereas a country with an inflexible currency system and involved in outward processing trade is more likely to have full pass through as shown in the case of china   c  2017 elsevier ltd  all rights reserved  
 extreme returns and herding of trade imbalances we estimate the stock s likelihood of extreme returns by measuring the extent to which the stock s trades are correlated with market wide and industry wide trades during normal times  referred to as herding  we find that stocks whose trades herd most with aggregate level trades experience most negative  positive  returns during market crashes  booms   while herding generates extreme returns in both sides  investors appear to demand compensation for the possibility of extreme low returns  this is the case even when we control for standard asset pricing variables and other tail risk proxies

 facilitating imaginations through online product presentation videos  effects on imagery fluency  product attitude and purchase intention the use of imagination is a dominant strategy for consumers to form evaluations in the e commerce environments  online product presentation videos  oppvs  are vivid information that can facilitate consumers this task  following the imagery fluency approach  we analyze the impact of oppvs on consumers  quality of product related thoughts  ease of imagining  and responses toward the product  a series of studies combining experimental  and survey based procedures shows that the presence and type of oppv improves consumers  cognitive responses and facilitates imagination about the product  which becomes a strong determinant of attitude and purchase intention  we also control for the oppv s trustworthiness to isolate the effects of the content characteristics of video  moreover  we consider the moderating role of the consumer s motivation to process information  the results demonstrate that high and low motivated consumers use their imagination differently  in addition  when oppvs are featured by the brand  ease of imagining does not relate to purchase intention  
 factors influencing consumer willingness to pay for low carbon products  a simulation study in china consumer choice behavior is crucial to supporting cleaner production and plays an essential role in low carbon development and environmental policy making  therefore  combining system dynamics with an agent based model  sd ab   the present study explores influencing factors on both providers  and consumers  sides  using empirical data from selected firms and a questionnaire survey of residents in china  the simulation results revealed that consumers  low carbon awareness and income have little effect on their willingness to pay for low carbon products  in contrast  some factors have an obvious effect on consumers  willingness to pay for low carbon products  including the delivery speed of low carbon products  consumers  patience and degree of satisfaction  thus  companies that provide low carbon products should be more focused on customer expectations and should ensure timely and efficient delivery to consumers  copyright  c  2017 john wiley   sons  ltd and erp environment 
 fail but try again  the effects of age  gender  and multiple owner experience on failed entrepreneurs  reentry we investigate what leads failed entrepreneurs to reenter entrepreneurship by taking a developmental career perspective  specifically  we hypothesize that the age of failed entrepreneurs has a nonlinear relationship with the likelihood of reentering entrepreneurship that follows different career stages  early  middle  and late   the gender of failed entrepreneurs and multiple owner experience in the failed firm are hypothesized to be moderators of this relationship  we test our hypotheses using a database consisting of the swedish population  including 4 761 entrepreneurs who failed between 2000 and 2004  analyzing their career paths over the years following their failure offers support for our theoretical expectations  
 family constitution and business performance  moderating factors this study analyzes the relationship between implementing a family constitution  protocol  and future family business performance  we analyze a unique sample of 530 spanish family businesses  half of these firms received financial aid from the government to implement a family protocol during 2003 2013  the analysis reveals that family businesses that implemented a family constitution had significantly improved performance within 2 years after the implementation  the positive relationship between the implementation of a family constitution and future firm performance is stronger for firms that had a nonfamily ceo  had multiple family owners  or were controlled by later generations  
 family firm performance  the influence of entrepreneurial orientation and absorptive capacity this article investigates the influence of entrepreneurial orientation and absorptive capacity on family firm performance  partial least squares structural equation modeling  pls sem  was used to analyze empirical data for 218 spanish family firms  absorptive capacity positively mediated the relationship between entrepreneurial orientation and family firm performance  this total mediation effect suppressed the direct effect of entrepreneurial orientation on family firm performance  a major implication of this finding is that for family firms to improve their performance through entrepreneurial orientation  absorptive capacity must act as a mediator  
 fifty shades of green  how microfoundations of sustainability dynamic capabilities vary across organizational contexts because making progress on sustainability related challenges will require organizational change for most organizations  understanding sustainability dynamic capabilities is of utmost importance  in this theoretical paper  we aim to identify the microfoundations of such sustainability dynamic capabilities on the one hand but  consistent with recent work in this research stream  we do so in a way that is sensitive to the dynamism of the organizational environment  we propose that the microfoundations of sustainability dynamic capabilities will take different forms in different contexts  we contrast moderately dynamic contexts characterized by frequent yet relatively predictable change with highly dynamic contexts in which changes are rapid and not predictable  achieving sustainability in these different types of contexts poses different types of challenges  relies on different forms of employee behaviors  and is consequently enabled by different individual level characteristics and different organizational practices and processes  our paper calls for a more serious consideration of context in investigating how employees  behaviors can affect sustainability at the organizational level  and outlines the implications for organizational policy and practice  we explore directions for future interdisciplinary research on sustainability that focuses on individuals and their interactions while also taking the environment within which organizations operate into account  
 financial constraints and the productivity survival link  evidence from china s firm level data we study how financial constraints influence the productivity survival link  using data of chinese industrial firms from 1998 through 2009  the analysis shows that financial constraints do not only play a negative role in firm survival  but also weaken the market selection against inefficient firms on average  we also find that the selection mechanism is ineffective for state owned firms and large firms  and that financial constraints hinder the growth of firm productivity and market share  
 financial literacy  role models  and micro enterprise performance in the informal economy this article analyses how financial literacy and role models contribute to explaining the performance of micro enterprises in the informal economy  grounded in human capital reasoning and social learning theory  we argue that financial literacy and personal knowledge of role models lead to improved firm performance  we test our hypotheses on a unique dataset of 739 micro enterprises in ecuador  we find that financial literacy is an important predictor of financial performance but not growth  and the use of role models predicts return on assets but not other performance metrics  our results have implications for future work on micro enterprises and the nature of the human and social capital of their founders

 firm bosses or helpful neighbours  the ambiguity and co construction of mne regional management mandates as multinational enterprises  mnes  increasingly disaggregate and disperse corporate headquarters  chq  activities  the allocation of regional management mandates  rmms  to local operating subsidiaries is becoming more common  rmms explicitly break with the traditional assumption of a clear separation between centralised and local decision making  yet we know little of how rmms are enacted by the units involved  or how they evolve over time  based on a case study of unilever  we find that rmms are inherently ambiguous  and identify circumstances under which ambiguity manifests and triggers cycles of sensemaking and sensegiving about the meaning of the mandate  these cycles result in the co construction of the mandate by multiple units  with changes in rmm scope and governance over time  we also find that sensemaking and sensegiving are most intense among boundary spanning middle managers  our work challenges prevailing assumptions that mandates are largely unambiguous when assigned and are unilateral or dyadic accomplishments  demonstrates the importance of sub unit level analysis in mnes  and highlights the potential of structuration theory to enrich our understanding of sensemaking and sensegiving in organisations  
 firm engagement and social issue salience  consensus  and contestation facing an increasing number and variety of issues with social salience  firms must determine how to engage with issues that likely have a significant impact on them  integrating issues management  im  and salience theories  the authors find that firms engage with socially contested issueswhere there is a high degree of societal disagreementin a different manner from issues that have social consensus  or high agreement  examining social issue resolutions filed by shareholders from 1997 to 2009  3 887 total observations   the study finds that socially contested issues  as well as those issues with social consensus  are both likely to result in engagement by the firm  for social issues with consensus  a firm is more likely to opt for a low level of shareholder engagement whereas resolutions regarding contested issues lead to engaging shareholders at a higher level  these findings shed new light on the im and issue salience literature streams that have suggested firms will react differently to these types of issues  even while they remain largely untested  finally  firms become less engaged with perennial issues over time  rather than more  providing new guidance to researchers  shareholder activists  and firms alike  to the authors  knowledge  such fined grained insight into expected levels of firm engagement with social issue salience has not been put forth previously  
 firm investment and stakeholder choices  a top down theory of capital budgeting this paper develops a top down model of capital budgeting in which privately informed executives make investment choices that convey information to the firm s stakeholders  e g   employees   favorable information in this setting encourages stakeholders to take actions that positively contribute to the firm s success  e g   employees work harder   within this framework we examine how firms may distort their investment choices to influence the information conveyed to stakeholders and show that investment rigidities and overinvestment can arise as optimal investment distortions  we also examine investment distortions in multi divisional firms and compare such distortions to those in single division firms

 firm specific credit risk estimation in the presence of regimes and noisy prices security prices are important inputs for estimating credit risk  yet  to obtain an accurate firm specific credit risk assessment  one needs a reliable model and a methodology that filters the elements unrelated to the firm s fundamentals from market prices  in this article  we introduce a hybrid credit risk model defined in a markov switching environment  it captures firm specific changes in the leverage uncertainty during crises  we also propose a new efficient method to estimate the model  and a numerical scheme based on trinomial lattices to price credit derivatives  the estimation is finally performed on more than 200 firms using maximum likelihood estimation   c  2017 elsevier inc  all rights reserved  
 fitting product placements  affective fit and cognitive fit as determinants of consumer evaluations of placed brands due to increased clutter and consumers  active avoidance of traditional media  marketers have sought alternative means to effectively reach their audiences  one such technique is the use of media based product placements in narrative  this strategy is often problematic  however  as extant research demonstrates that when consumers are aware of blatant placements  their attitudes toward the placed product may become less  rather than more  favorable  in a series of studies  we develop and test a theoretically based product placement fit model that recognizes the importance of congruency between consumers  narrative consumption goals and the manner in which products are placed  results indicate that when product placements are congruent with both the narrative s story structure  cognitive fit  and the affective tones elicited by the narrative  affective fit   more favorable brand attitudes are produced  further  narrative enjoyment resulting from a product placement mediates the impact of product placement fit on consumers  brand evaluations  
 flexible firm level dividends in latin america we show  for a sample of up to 757 industrial firms  in seven latin american countries from 1994 2014  that these firms exhibit comparatively flexible payout behavior  flexibility is defined in respect to  i  variability in firm payout status and amounts and  ii  parameters of the lambrecht myers  2012  theory on the lintner  1956  dividend equation  the results indicate that latin american firms have higher speeds of adjustment and target payout ratios as well as lower rates of habit formation than found in the payout policies of united states firms  this note  thus  highlights an open question regarding conspicuously flexible payout policies in latin american firms   c  2017 elsevier inc  all rights reserved  
 for love and money  marital leadership in family firms we investigate how leadership by couples affects the profitability of family firms  using comprehensive data from italy  we show that family firms led by married couples perform significantly better than other family firms  this result is robust to several estimation techniques  including matching  instrumental variables and transition analyses  marital leadership works best when firm operations are complex and knowledge based  as well as when the firm is subject to agency conflicts due to weak competition and poor legal infrastructure  studying the mechanisms behind these results  we show that the presence of couples at the top of the firm enhances the willingness to invest during uncertain times  reduces employee turnover  and improves labor productivity   c  2017 elsevier b v  all rights reserved  
 forecasting emerging technologies  a supervised learning approach through patent analysis both private and public enterprises have great interest in prior knowledge of emerging technologies to enable them make strategic investments  technology forecasting offers a relevant opportunity in this direction and is currently a hot upcoming area of research  however  accurate forecasting of emerging technologies is still problematic mainly due to absence labeled historical data to use in training of learners  previous studies have approached the technological forecasting problem through unsupervised learning methods and  as such  are missing out on potential benefits of supervised learning approaches such as full automation  in this study  we propose a novel algorithm to automatically label data and then use the labeled data to train learners to forecast emerging technologies  as a case study  we used patent citation data provided by the united states patent and trademark office to test and evaluate the proposed algorithm  the algorithm uses advanced patent citation techniques to derive useful predictors from patent citation data with a result of forecasting new technologies at least a year before they emerge  our evaluation reveals that our proposed algorithm can retrieve as high as 70  of emerging technologies in a given year with high precision  
 forecasting the volatility of nikkei 225 futures this article proposes an indirect method for forecasting the volatility of futures returns  based on the relationship between futures and the underlying asset for the returns and time varying volatility  the paper considers the stochastic volatility model with asymmetry and long memory  using high frequency data of the underlying asset  for forecasting its volatility  the empirical results for nikkei 225 futures indicate that the adjusted r 2 supports the appropriateness of the indirect method  and that the new method based on stochastic volatility models with asymmetry and long memory outperforms the forecasting model based on the direct method using the pseudo long time series  
 foreclosure delay and consumer credit performance the deep housing market recession from 2008 through 2010 was characterized by a steep rise in number of foreclosures  the average length of time from onset of delinquency through the end of the foreclosure process also expanded dramatically  although most individuals undergoing foreclosure were experiencing serious financial stress  the extended foreclosure timelines enabled them to live in their homes without making mortgage payments until the end of the foreclosure process  thus providing temporary income and liquidity benefits from lower housing costs  this paper investigates the impact of extended foreclosure timelines on borrower performance with credit card debt  our results indicate that a longer period of nonpayment of mortgage expenses results in higher cure rates on delinquent credit cards and reduced credit card balances  thus  foreclosure process delays may have mitigated the impact of the economic downturn on credit card default suggesting that improvement in credit card performance during the post crisis period would likely be slowed by the removal of the temporary liquidity benefits as foreclosures reach completion  
 foreign direct investment and intellectual property rights  international intangible assets in spain over the long term this article reflects on foreign direct investment  fdi  and intellectual property rights  iprs  over the long term  and analyzes the case of spain during the nineteenth and twentieth centuries  although the interactions between iprs and fdi have attracted significant research efforts in distinct economic and business areas  the results lack permanent answers  our findings demonstrate that  from a macro level perspective   1  fdi and iprs are effectively related over the long term   2  weak ipr protection does not seem to have stopped fdi  and  3  the countries with major fdi in spain were less worried about ipr management than were other countries with less fdi  
 foreshadowing as impression management  illuminating the path for security analysts research summary  managers can disclose information to security analysts as a form of impression management  but doing so is problematic because competitors can use that same information at the expense of the firm  we identify an impression management technique we call foreshadowing  which refers to hinting about future potential strategic activity  foreshadowing provides information of value to analysts that can influence their evaluations of a firm  but not so much information as to put the firm at a competitive disadvantage  we hypothesize and find that managers who foreshadow acquisition announcements receive fewer analyst downgrades following the announcements  especially when there is more analyst uncertainty about the firm  we also hypothesize and find that analysts  responses to foreshadowing positively influence the likelihood that managers eventually acquire other firms managerial summary  security analysts are often suspicious when firms announce acquisitions as those announcements are cumbersome to analyze on short notice and raise questions about managerial motivations that might not represent the best interests of the firm  we find that managers can improve analyst reactions to acquisition announcements by disclosing some information of value to analystsspecifically by hinting that an acquisition could occur in the future  we refer to such hints as foreshadowing  foreshadowing entails giving analysts information to reduce their suspicions and facilitate their analyses  but not so much information as to degrade the firm s competitive information advantage over other firms  foreshadowing also allows managers the option to reconsider actually executing the acquisition if analysts respond negatively to its possibility  copyright  c  2017 john wiley   sons  ltd  
 foresight for all  co elaborative scenario building and empowerment we present here a co elaborative scenario building approach  called participatory prospective analysis  ppa  and discuss its relevance for empowering local communities organizations  this approach is adapted from the french  la prospective   it is used as an action research engaging local farming communities in expanding their understanding of their own futures  three cases of local implementation at farmer community level in india  indonesia  and the philippines illustrate how this approach was implemented  they are part of a global project in the field of food  agriculture and rural development  aiming at balancing the capacity to use the future  which is currently not fairly distributed to the detriment of local stakeholders  organizations and communities  our results focus on the emergence of futures literacy as a capability  its connection to local agency and societal transformation  our discussion highlights what in this approach makes the use of scenarios empowering  beyond its participatory features  the capacity to use the future has a great potential for local agency  even if it does not guarantee that communities will have the power or the willingness to directly engage in actions  nevertheless  this approach seems to be a promising avenue for making everyone a future literate potential agent of change  
 formal controls and alliance performance  the effects of alliance motivation and informal controls in this research  we study the use of formal control types  outcome  behavior  across different alliance motivations  exploitation  exploration  ambidextrous  and the effects on alliance performance  this study further examines whether this relationship is moderated by the use of informal controls  survey data from 236 organizations pursuing strategic alliances indicate that when firms opt for one primary strategic alliance motivation  firms  emphasis on either outcome controls  in exploitation alliances  or behavior controls  in exploration alliances  increases alliance performance  results also support a complementary relationship between outcome and behavior controls in explaining alliance performance in ambidextrous alliances  furthermore  our findings reveal that while informal controls enhance the effectiveness of behavior controls in exploration alliances  the benefits of informal controls disappear in the context of outcome controls and exploitation alliances  in ambidextrous alliances  firms need to carefully proportion the informal control level because beyond a moderate level  informal controls seem to negatively affect a control configuration using outcome and behavior controls  our analysis provides a more nuanced view on how organizations may successfully control alliances with different motivations   c  2017 elsevier ltd  all rights reserved  
 forms of inconspicuous consumption  what drives inconspicuous luxury consumption in china  inconspicuous consumption   whereby brand signals are subtle  or not easily visible  to most consumers and the overt display of social status is sidestepped   is on the rise  even in china  which has typically favoured conspicuous brand signalling  research on luxury brands tends to focus on conspicuous consumption  and few studies have explored the ways in which chinese consumers use chinese luxury brands in inconspicuous ways  this study examines how chinese luxury consumers are redefining their identity projects  as well as their conceptions of luxury  in relation to inconspicuous consumption  we suggest that inconspicuous consumption encompasses consuming luxury products without overtly displaying wealth and social status  thus  certain luxury brands enable inconspicuous consumption  turning to a group of chinese luxury brands offers insights into how luxury brands may fill this role for newly emerging forms of inconspicuous consumption  we distinguish four forms of inconspicuous consumption  illustrated by consumers  1  with wished for identities or fantasy lifestyles   2  who appreciate aesthetics and function   3  who are wealthy and prefer not to provoke envy and or anger in times of economic austerity and  4  who desire to differentiate themselves and employ subtle signals that are only observable to people with the requisite knowledge to decode their meaning  these forms of inconspicuous consumption facilitate the construction and display of one s reflective identities  including privately fantasized identity  privately held identity and partially public reflective identities  thus  we contribute to identity construction theory by explicating aspects of reflective identity and linking them to forms of inconspicuous consumption  finally  we expand upon recent research on inconspicuous consumption by demonstrating how inconspicuous consumption is manifested in china   the largest luxury market  the results help redefine constructs in the paradoxical situation of inconspicuous consumption of luxury brands  adding a layer of complexity to the inconspicuous consumption concept  
 framing social media communication  investigating the effects of brand post appeals on user interaction social networking sites  sns  play an increasingly important role in the mix of brands  marketing communication  a key question for marketing departments  therefore  is how brand posts can be best framed to provoke positive user reactions and interactions  in order to better understand the determinants of communication success on sns  we propose a theoretical framework of how users process posts on sns  its logic suggests that the overall theme of a post   post appeal   is a main antecedent of communication success  thus  we empirically examine the effects of post appeals on user interaction by profoundly analysing a sample of 1948 facebook posts  results show that some post appeals have positive and others have negative impact on user interaction  interestingly  some of the appeals with positive impact are rarely used by brands  while some of the appeals with negative impact are used quite frequently  indicating that brands currently do not grasp the full potential of post appeal strategy  this article concludes by discussing theoretical and managerial implications   c  2017 elsevier ltd  all rights reserved  
 friendship at work and error disclosure organizations rely on contextual factors to promote employee disclosure of selfmade errors  which induces a resource dilemma  i e   disclosure entails costing one s own resources to bring others resources  and a friendship dilemma  i e   disclosure is seemingly easier through friendship  yet the cost of friendship is embedded   this study proposes that friendship at work enhances error disclosure and uses conservation of resources theory as underlying explanation  a three wave survey collected data from 274 full time employees with a variety of occupational backgrounds  empirical results indicated that friendship enhanced error disclosure partially through relational mechanisms of employees  attitudes toward coworkers  i e   employee engagement  and of coworkers  attitudes toward employees  i e   perceived social worth   such effects hold when controlling for established predictors of error disclosure  this study expands extant perspectives on employee error and the theoretical lenses used to explain the influence of friendship at work  we propose that  while promoting error disclosure through both contextual and relational approaches  organizations should be vigilant about potential incongruence   c  2017 acede  published by elsevier espana  s l u  
 from  prisoner s dilemma  to reluctance to use judicial discretion  the enemies of cooperation in european cross border cases this article will focus on articles 41 44 of the recast european insolvency regulation  regulation 2015 848  and the dynamic of cooperation and communication between courts and insolvency practitioners  two main ideas will be maintained  the first is that cooperation requires a legal framework which is certain otherwise  prescriptions imposing duties of cooperation and communication might produce  prisoner s dilemmas  and  paradoxically  unwillingness to cooperate  the second idea is that prescriptions imposing duties of cooperation and communication have an intrinsic open texture this characteristic ontologically requires courts and insolvency practitioners to make choices between different rulings and activities  these findings imply that while interventions  both at european level and at national level  aiming at making the legal framework more certain are always welcome  interventions aiming at better specifying contents and extension of duties of cooperation and communication could be to a certain extent useless and even counterproductive  copyright  c  2017 insol international and john wiley   sons  ltd

 gambler s attention and the mean variance relation  evidence from china research from psychology suggests that gambler s fallacy and limited attention matter for individual decision making involving risk  we dub this combination  gambler s attention  and use it to provide a behavioral perspective on the debate over the market s mean variance relation  a gambler s attention index is developed to divide the sample period into high attention and low attention regimes  using data from china  we find clear cut evidence that the market s mean variance relation is significantly positive in low attention periods but not in high attention periods  the results are consistent with the notion that gambler s attention undermines an otherwise positive risk return tradeoff in high attention periods   c  2017 elsevier inc  all rights reserved  
 gambling with the public sphere  accounting s contribution to debate on social issues this paper explores the contribution of accounts  especially counter accounts  to the debate on social issues in the public sphere  we examine a social activist organisation s challenge to a major corporation to acknowledge the issue of problem gambling and change its poker machine operations  while the professionally sanctioned corporate financial statements and corporate responsibility reports failed to contribute relevant information for an informed public debate  the activist organisation sponsored and produced both narrative and calculative counter accounts which contributed to public debate  we initially anchor our approach in habermas to explore dialogic accounts and democratic accountability at the deliberative agonistic divide  our contextualised  theorised narrative identifies the accounts and counter accounts provided by the protagonists  practically  the paper demonstrates the power of counter accounts to reinvigorate debate in the public sphere  irrespective of whether it stimulates a change in corporate behaviour  we therefore contend that social accounting should be empirically examined and contextually interpreted  the case brings into focus the deliberative agonistic divide inherent in democratic systems and recognised in the social accounting literature  and suggests that ideological differences make it difficult for corporate and activist protagonists to co exist as friendly enemies  this challenges habermas conception of a public sphere as naively idealistic  since it neglects contemporary ideological  political and power differentials  but proposes a space in which debate about accounting s role in social issues can be agonistically debated  it leads us to call for more theoretically informed  contextualised case studies to examine the potential of accounting to enable public debate on social issues  crown copyright  c  2017 published by elsevier ltd  all rights reserved

 getting down and dirty  an exploration of participation in the field of obstacle challenges this paper examines the contemporary phenomenon of obstacle challenges and why people participate in events that result in them getting soaking wet  freezing cold  and dirtier than they have ever been while also getting shot with pellets and receiving electric shocks  many participants in these challenges have taken part numerous times and keep coming back for more  using multiple research methods including questionnaires  participant observation where the author completed one of ireland s more well known and toughest physical and mental endurance challenges  and also depth interviews with challenge participants has resulted in a rich and detailed account of the obstacle challenge experience  these events are so much more than a few hours of strenuous and muddy physical exercise  the sense of community and camaraderie that people experience during these challenges could be described as transformative with participants in many cases more rewarded and moved by this collaborative aspect than the gruelling physical endeavour that they undertake  the escapism provided by the experience is also one its main rewards  relief from the quotidian and the chance to just be  the servicescape proves to be critically important to the experience but in ways that are largely incompatible with research in this area to date in that the comfort and cleanliness expected of more traditional servicescapes are spurned and physical hardship is welcomed  as this is an exploratory and novel research topic  suggestions for further research are plentiful

 grounds for refusal of recognition of  quasi   annex judgements in the recast european insolvency regulation insolvency related  annex  actions and judgements fall within the scope of the recast european insolvency regulation   recast eir    that instrument both determines international jurisdiction regarding annex actions and sets up a simplified recognition system for annex judgements  however  tension between the recast eir s provisions on jurisdiction and recognition arises when a court of a state different from the state of insolvency erroneously assumes jurisdiction for annex actions  such   quasi annex  judgements rendered by foreign courts erroneously assuming jurisdiction threaten the integrity of the insolvency proceedings  besides  the quasi annex judgements may violate the effectiveness and efficiency of the insolvency proceedings as well as the principle of legal certainty  in this article  it is argued that even the current legal framework may offer some ways to avoid the recognition of such quasi annex judgements  first  the scope of the public policy exception may be extended in order to protect the integrity of the insolvency proceedings from the quasi annex judgements rendered by foreign courts erroneously assuming jurisdiction  second  it may be argued that quasi annex judgements do not equal real annex judgements and therefore do not enjoy the automatic recognition system provided by the recast eir  at the same time  their close connection to the insolvency proceedings   disregarded by the forum erroneously assuming jurisdiction   may exclude quasi annex judgements from the scope of the brussels ibis regulation  as well  as a consequence  those quasi annex judgements may fall within the gap between the two regulations  meaning that no european instrument instructs the courts of the member state addressed to recognise quasi annex judgements  copyright  c  2017 insol international and john wiley   sons  ltd  
 guarvci grx  ganging  renging  xinren  and conflict management in sino us business relationships this paper challenges the existing view of guanxi as comprising one combined notion  and thus proposes to investigate guanxi s sub dimensions individually  developed from confucius relationalism  the proposed grx conflict management framework argues that ganging  emotional attachment   renqing  reciprocal favour exchange  and xinren  interpersonal trust  have different effects on reducing task and emotional conflict  empirical findings based on 300 sino us business relationships reveal that ganging and xinren can significantly reduce both emotional and task conflict  whilst rowing does not have a significant effect on reducing either  nevertheless  upon moderation analysis  the effects of ganging and renqing in reducing emotional and task conflict become more significant when dealing with the more experienced buyer  with a longer length of employment   whilst xinren s impact on reducing task conflict is lessened in more mature relationships  those with a longer business relationship duration   compared to less developed business relationships  the findings shed new light to guanxi literature  with evidence highlighting how grx dimensions may be employed individually to effectively reduce conflict in sino us business relationships

 happy grocery shopper  the creation of positive emotions through affective digital signage content recent research has identified digital signage  ds  as a promising element for creating atmospheric value  however  extant studies have explored shoppers  reactions to ds showing advertising content in hedonic shopping environments  considering the potential of utilitarian shopping situations to evoke negative emotions  the current research investigates whether ds positively affects consumers  responses in task oriented shopping situations  in doing so  it incorporates assumptions from the limited capacity model and resource matching theory into a theoretical framework to explain how task relevant ds content influences impulse purchases and store loyalty  this relationship is mediated by emotional and cognitive processes  by drawing on findings from prior studies  this research further differentiates the effects of cognitive  affective  and mixed ds content on consumer responses  a field experiment tests the theoretically derived responses  the findings suggest that affective ds content creates positive emotions and increases impulsive purchases and store loyalty   c  2016 elsevier inc  all rights reserved  
 has the uniformity of banking regulation within the european union restricted rather than encouraged sectoral development  the recent international financial crisis exposed many of the frailties that existwithin the european banking sector  one major decision taken by the european commission was to transition the powers of the committee of european banking supervisors to that of the european banking authority  eba   our analysis focuses primarily on the differing behaviour by each european country s banking sector to major shocks  namely that in the form of bank closures  it is then necessary to investigate and further understand the role that the european banking authority now possesses with regards to releasing sensitive announcements based on the underlying currents of the european banking system as measured by domestic banking sector stock returns  finally  we investigate the cultural characteristics that can be uncovered by analysing the responses of domestic banking sectors to uniform regulation  we present three key findings  first  european countries with more local banking networks in the form of credit unions  public banks or savings banks  generate greater levels of volatility when compared to that of their commercial counterparts  particularly in countries with more monopolistic sectors  secondly  the announcements of the european banking authority generate significant volatility effects for the european banking sector at large  with particular emphasis on stress testing results  but also announcements based on recapitalisation  regulation and transparency  finally  cultural distance effects are identified  indicating that peripheral states are experiencing more substantial volatility effects to european banking authority decisions  these results indicate that uniformity of regulation may in fact be hindering and restricting the growth of some domestic and more peripheral and locally designed banking sectors in the form of rules designed for commercial banking operations   c  2017 elsevier inc  all rights reserved  
 having burned the straw man of christian spiritual leadership  what can we learn from jesus about leading ethically  in considering what it means to lead organizations effectively and ethically  the literature comprising spirituality at work  saw  and spiritual leadership theory  slt  has become highly influential  especially in the usa  it has also attracted significant criticism  while in this paper  we endorse this critique  we argue that the strand of literature which purportedly takes a christian standpoint within the wider saw school of thought  largely misconstrues and misapplies the teaching of its founder  jesus  as a result  in dismissing the claims and application of saw and slt  there is a real risk that we lose the vital contribution of christian thought  not least some of the timeless counter cultural wisdom of jesus which  we contend  offers a vital foundation to the practice of ethical leadership and business ethics in organizations  in proposing a way forward  two thorny issues which face all leaders are addressed  dealing with ego and closing the gap between what we say and what we do  the more we understand about the dynamics of human nature  the more we learn about the profundity of jesus  teachings  we then propose a number of ways in which jesus centred ethical leadership can be practised  each is radical and each implies risk  both the personal risk of inner renewal arising from repentance as a doorway to personal integrity  as well as the risk of opposing unethical practices and promoting the excellence of core practices in the workplace  
 health externalities of india s expansion of coal plants  evidence from a national panel of 40 000 households coal power generation is expanding rapidly in india and other developing countries  in addition to consequences for climate change  present day health externalities may also substantially increase the social cost of coal  health consequences of air pollution have proven important in studies of developed countries  but  despite clear importance  similarly well identified estimates are less available for developing countries  and no estimates exist for the important case of coal in india  we exploit panel data on indian households  matched to local changes in exposure to coal plants  increased exposure to coal plants is associated with worse respiratory health  consistent with a causal mechanism  the effect is specific  no effect is seen on diarrhea or fever  and no effect on respiratory health is seen of new non coal plants  our result is not due to endogenous avoidance behavior  or to differential trends in determinants of respiratory health  either before the period studied or simultaneously   c  2017 the authors  published by elsevier inc  
 hedge fund return dependence  model misspecification or liquidity spirals  we test whether model misspecification or liquidity spirals primarily explain the observed excess dependence in filtered  for economic fundamentals  hedge fund index returns and the links between volatility  liquidity shocks  and hedge fund return clustering  evidence supports the model misspecification hypothesis  i  hedge fund filtered return clustering is symmetric  ii  filtered short bias fund returns exhibit negative dependence with filtered returns for other hedge fund types  iii  negative liquidity shocks are associated with clustering in both tails and market volatility subsumes the role of negative liquidity shocks  and iv  these same patterns appear in size sorted equity portfolios  
 hedging and speculative pressures and the transition of the spot futures relationship in energy and metal markets this paper examines the impact of hedging and speculative pressures on the transition of the spot futures relationship in metal and energy markets  we build a markov regime switching  mrs  model where hedging and speculative pressures affect the transition probabilities between a stronger and weaker spot futures relationship  it is found that hedging pressure increases the likelihood of transition  i e  destabilises the existing spot futures relationship  while speculative pressure reduces it  i e  stabilises the relationship  in the copper  crude oil and natural gasmarkets  but this effect is relatively weak in the silver and heating oil markets  we also examine whether these findings generate practical benefits by testing the hedging effectiveness of the minimum variance hedge ratios  mvh  derived from the mrs models with hedging and speculative pressures  a relatively strong reduction of the portfolio variance  hedger s utility and value at risk  var  is observed in the energy markets   c  2016 elsevier inc  all rights reserved

 heterogeneous firms  financial constraints and export behaviour  a firm level investigation for china we study the impact of access to finance on exports using chinese firm level data  we distinguish two modes of external finance  namely bank loans and issuing stocks to shareholders  we not only consider the impact either of these has individually on export behaviour  but also their interaction  we build the two external sources  as well as internal finance  into a heterogeneous firm type model  which allows us to investigate the relationship between financial constraints and firms  exports  we examine the model s predictions empirically using a comprehensive longitudinal firm level data set from china  our empirical results are consistent with the theoretical predictions  firms who have more interest expenditure or can issue stocks to their shareholders have higher propensity to export and export more  moreover  the more financial options a firm has  the better a firm performs in terms of export volume and export propensity  
 high reputation firms and their differential acquisition behaviors research summary  emerging reputation research suggests that high reputation firms will act to maintain their reputations in the face of high expectations  yet  this research remains unclear on how high reputation firms do so  we advance this research by exploring three questions related to high reputation firms  differential acquisition behaviors  do high reputation firms make more acquisitions than similar firms without this distinction  what kind of acquisitions do they make  how do investors react to high reputation firms  differential acquisition behaviors  we find that high reputation firms make more acquisitions and more unrelated acquisitions than other firms  yet  we also find that investors bid down high reputation firms  stock more than other firms  in response to acquisition announcements  suggesting that investors are skeptical of how high reputation firms maintain their reputations  managerial summary  we know that high reputation firms wish to maintain their elite standing in the face of high market expectations  but we know little about how they do so  we explore this puzzle by investigating how reputation maintenance influences high reputation firms  acquisition behaviors  we classify high reputation firms are those firms that make fortune s most admired annual list  and we find that high reputation firms make more acquisitions and more unrelated ones than other firms  surprisingly  we also find that the market tends to react negatively to these acquisitions  thus  managers may want to reconsider their strategy of making acquisitions as a means to maintain their firms  high reputations  copyright  c  2017 john wiley   sons  ltd

 high tech start up firm survival originating from a combined use of internal resources although various streams in the existing literature on the resource based view  rbv  of the firm argue that firm survival and performance can benefit from a combined use of internal resources  relatively limited empirical evidence is provided that supports this argument  to fill this gap in the literature  in this article  we focus on how combinations of internal resources affect the survival chance of technology based start ups by using a unique dataset from a high tech park in beijing  china  empirical results show that firms  interconnected internal resources exert a significant influence on these firms  survival chance  our findings imply that the survival of new technology based start ups benefits from the synergetic effect of combining resources  in detail  the data support the hypothesis that the combined use of r d resources  internal financial resources  and scientifically skilled employees  as posited by the rbv  has an amplifying effect on the chances to survive of high tech start ups  
 higher highs and lower lows  the role of corporate social responsibility in ceo dismissal research summary  investing a firm s resources in corporate social responsibility  csr  initiatives remains a contentious issue  while research suggests firm financial performance is the primary driver of ceo dismissal  we propose that csr will provide important additional context when interpreting a firm s financial performance  consistent with this prediction  our results suggest that past csr decisions amplify the negative relationship between financial performance and ceo dismissal  specifically  we find that greater prior investments in csr appear to expose ceos of firms with poor financial performance to a greater risk of dismissal  in contrast  greater past investments in csr appear to help shield ceos of firms with good financial performance from dismissal  these findings provide novel insight into how ceos  career outcomes may be affected by earlier csr decisions  managerial summary  in this study  we examined a potential personal consequence for ceos related to corporate social responsibility  csr   we explored the role prior investments in csr play when a board evaluates the firm s financial performance and considers whether or not to fire the ceo  our results suggest that while financial performance sets the overall tone of a ceo s evaluation  csr amplifies that baseline evaluation  specifically  our results suggest that greater past investments in csr appear to  a  greatly increase the likelihood of ceo dismissal when financial performance is poor  and  b  somewhat reduce the likelihood of ceo dismissal when financial performance is good  thus  striving to deliver profits in a socially responsible manner may have both positive and negative personal consequences  copyright  c  2017 john wiley   sons  ltd  
 home alone  the effects of lone insider boards on ceo pay  financial misconduct  and firm performance research summary  corporate scandals of the previous decade have heightened attention on board independence  indeed  boards at many large firms are now so independent that the ceo is home alone as the lone inside member  we build upon pro insider research within agency theory to explain how the growing trend toward lone insider boards affects key outcomes and how external governance forces constrain their impact  we find evidence among s p 1500 firms that having a lone insider board is associated with  a  excess ceo pay and a larger ceo top management team pay gap   b  increased likelihood of financial misconduct  and  c  decreased firm performance  but that stock analysts and institutional investors reduce these negative effects  the findings raise important questions about the efficacy of leaving the ceo home alone managerial summary  following concerns that insider dominated boards failed to protect shareholders  there has been a push for greater board independence  this push has been so successful that the ceo is now the only insider on the boards of more than half of s p 1500 firms  we examine whether lone insider boards do in fact offer strong governance or whether they enable ceos to benefit personally  we find that lone insider boards pay ceos excessively  pay ceos a disproportionately large amount relative to other top managers  have more instances of financial misconduct  and have lower performance than boards with more than one insider  thus  it appears that lone insider boards do not function as intended and firms should reconsider whether the push towards lone insider boards is actually in shareholders  best interests  copyright  c  2017 john wiley   sons  ltd  
 hooked on a feeling  the effect of music tempo on attitudes and the mediating role of consumers  affective responses with today s high degree of advertising clutter  marketers might greatly focus on evoking emotion or creating hedonic  e g   feeling  experiences for consumers in order to improve practice  these strategies minimize the effort needed to process a message and can influence consumers  decisions  in 4 studies  we examine the effects of music tempo on consumers  attitudes toward the brand while further considering the mediating role of evoked feelings  study 1 and 2 supports that music tempo in commercials influences consumers  affective response to the music in advertising  study 3 replicated this effect using a controlled experiment and extended the research by demonstrating that tempo also affects general mood states  in addition to feelings evoked by the music  last  study 4 demonstrates that need for emotion moderates the role of affect as information  this research contributes to theory in sensory marketing and consumer behavior and offers practical implications to improve marketing practice  
 household access to mortgages in the uk we employ the propensity score matching approach to investigate household access to mortgages in the uk using information on 29 732 households between 2003 and 2010  we find that  on average  the probability of obtaining a mortgage is similar for white and non white households  however  we find that black households with low incomes are less likely to have mortgages compared to white households with similar characteristics  asian households  in contrast  do not seem to have a lower probability of having a mortgage

 how and why conversational value leads to happiness for experiential and material purchases this work presents convergent evidence that experiential purchases are more conducive to interpersonal conversations than are material purchases that is  experiences have higher conversational value  which helps explain why they afford consumers greater happiness than do objects  van boven and gilovich 2003   further  two experiments demonstrate that factors known to differ between experiential and material purchases closeness to the self  social approval  and purchase uniqueness help explain why experiences are preferred as a topic of conversation over objects  and suggest a social motivation for talking more about experiences  indeed  when the motivation to build a relationship with the conversation partner is removed  the preference to share about experiences  vs  objects  disappears  together  these findings add to and help integrate the growing literature on the relation between purchase type  material vs  experiential  and purchase related happiness

 how brand post content contributes to user s facebook brand page engagement  the experiential route of active participation creating and developing a firm hosted virtual brand community forms part of a relationship marketing strategy  therefore  it makes sense to evaluate its effectiveness in terms of relational outcomes  in an attempt to know how marketers can foster the relationship with the brand through virtual communities  we posit and estimate a model of relational efficacy for a firm managed facebook brand page  fbp  in which the brand posts created by the firm influence the behavioural engagement of individual users through the utilitarian and hedonic values derived from their interactive experiences within the fbp  the findings highlight that information posts stimulate user behavioural engagement through the utilitarian experiential route  aside from any experiential route and adopting a more direct path  interaction posts are the main drivers of engagement behaviour  image posts contribute towards the perception of utility  but in no way affect engagement  finally  in order to gain a deeper insight  we explore the moderating effect of user brand purchase intensity on the relations posited in the model   c  2017 acede  published by elsevier espana  s l u  
 how can academic innovation performance in university industry collaboration be improved  as universities gradually become the center of society s knowledge production system  their role in innovation becomes more diverse  in the pursuit of such a role  universities are encouraged to establish a university industry collaboration  uic  context that supports faculties and students to engage in entrepreneurial activities  on the basis of the organizational control perspective  we investigated how uic factors  namely implementing a formal uic management mechanism  implementing uic regulations  and supporting an innovative climate  influence  the academic innovation performance of universities  the results of partial least squares analysis of 141 taiwanese universities showed that uic subsidized universities have more advantages for developing their uic environment and improving academic innovation performance  we found that a formal uic management mechanism might be the most essential factor for enhancing the academic innovation performance of non uic subsidized universities  furthermore  the innovation climate was found to moderate the relationship between formal uic management mechanisms and academic innovation performance   c  2016 elsevier inc  all rights reserved

 how do cities support electric vehicles and what difference does it make  many cities publish climate change mitigation strategies and other policy measures to support the wide spread uptake of electric vehicles  evs   this paper investigates the effectiveness of these strategies and the provision of infrastructures in 30 uk cities  with a specific emphasis on those strategies that are within the remit of cities and local authorities  the climate mitigation strategies and supporting documents were obtained from 30 uk cities recommended by the urban audit methodology  we show that 13 cities mention evs in their strategies  analysing ev registrations and the ev infrastructures that is provided by cities we found that there is no statistical difference in the number of charging points or evs between the cities that have evs as part of their climate change mitigation strategy and those that do not  it was shown that ev uptake was more generally associated with other factors  such as local vehicle population or income  rather than any documented ev climate mitigation strategy  we demonstrate that local strategies are failing in achieving the much needed step change and make suggestions how to improve ev uptake as an even more radical thinking and policies may become necessary to achieve carbon reduction targets  
 how do mentoring rewards influence experienced auditors  the benefits of mentoring are well documented  and include lower employee turnover  heightened employee success  and higher employee satisfaction  in an effort to acquire these benefits  audit firms are structuring rewards for mentoring  however  we predict that rewarding mentors can prove problematic  leaving needy young auditors without a mentor or perhaps receiving advice that might prove detrimental  we test our expectations in an experiment with 111 big 4 auditor participants  as expected  we find that in the presence of mentoring rewards  experienced auditors are less willing to mentor the young auditors who likely would benefit the most  we also find that in the presence of mentoring rewards  experienced auditors are more likely to provide advice that might be counterproductive  yet interestingly  in our study  when rewards are absent  experienced auditors are more willing to mentor and more likely to provide beneficial advice  our results inform the audit mentoring literature though our focus on mentor behavior  as opposed to protege behavior  our results also have implications for audit firms as they consider the structure of mentoring rewards  training on mentoring advice  and the effects of this advice   c  2017 elsevier ltd  all rights reserved  
 how do social media affect analyst stock recommendations  evidence from s p 500 electric power companies  twitter accounts research summary  the importance of firm stakeholder relationships is gaining increasing attention  although a theory of the drivers and consequences of stakeholder pressure has been developing  it focuses on pressures from organized stakeholders such as shareholders  ngos  and activists  and does not incorporate the emerging possibility that individual voices may matter  by exploring corporate twitter  which facilitates movement of individual stakeholders such as customers to a higher stakeholder class by providing them with a greater sense of power and urgency  we study the circumstances under which customer voices significantly affect analyst stock recommendations  we find that favorable reactions to firm initiated messages matter  directly or indirectly  depending on the messages  growth implications  customer initiated negative messages have a significant impact only with high volume and formal institutions that support customer opinions managerial summary  social media is increasingly used by firms for disclosing information and engaging stakeholders  yet  we know little about whether and how social media usage matters  we show how corporate twitter usage may influence analyst stock recommendations  our interviews of securities analysts suggest that social media is not institutionalized yet  but increasingly used as a source of channel checks  especially for vibes  validations  and so on  our analyses of corporate twitter accounts show that both firm initiated and customer initiated tweets can have significant impact on analyst recommendations under certain conditions  for firm initiated tweets  the extent of retweets is an important factor  along with the content of tweets  in particular  growth implications  for customer initiated tweets  negative tweets matter  but only with high volume and regulatory structure that supports customer protection  copyright  c  2017 john wiley   sons  ltd  
 how does a grand challenge become displaced  explaining the duality of field mobilization grand challenges are complex problems with far reaching societal implications that lack a clear solution  to make progress  diverse communities often coalesce around an ambitious field goal  however  many field initiatives fall short of their initial objectives  when fields mobilize for a grand challenge  what inhibits them from realizing their intended ambitions  this is a critical question not only for grand challenges  but also for institutional theory  which tends to focus on field mobilization rather than on how goals are pursued over time  field scholars often assume stable participants with goals that easily translate into actions  but fields are dynamic and unlikely to comply with these assumptions  with a longitudinal  multimethod study of the nanotechnology field  we examined how five communities mobilized and pursued the grand challenge of creating molecular manufacturing from 1986 to 2005  we identify a key duality of mobilization  the very strategies employed to successfully mobilize diverse participants to support the grand challenge actually helped displace it with less ambitious goals  we develop a grounded theoretical model explaining goal displacement in the context of grand challenges  and  in so doing  contribute a dynamic political understanding of field level strategic action

 how does material resource adequacy affect innovation project performance  a meta analysis the link between material resource adequacy and the performance of innovation projects is one of the most basic and managerially rewarding relationships in innovation management to study  and yet it has remained unclear  some argue that adequate material resources foster innovation  whereas others suggest the exact opposite  constrained material resources stimulate creativity and innovation  complementing previous work that focused on project level contingencies of the relationship between material resource adequacy and innovation project performance  the objective of this meta analysis is to develop a contingency framework involving study level and context level boundary conditions in an attempt to clarify this relationship  the results show that material resource adequacy is basically positively related to innovation project performance  testing whether the focus on different dimensions of innovation project performance alters this basic relationship results in the same positive relationship for all examined innovation project outcomes  i e   general performance  project efficiency  product quality  speed  and market success   except new product novelty that did not show a significant relationship with material resource adequacy  moreover  while the relationship between material resource adequacy and innovation project outcomes turns out to be generalizable across different types of material resources  financial resources vs  equipment  and different product types  tangible vs  intangible products   it is contingent upon the national culture of the countries  in which the projects have been carried out  specifically  studies in countries scoring high on the cultural dimension of power distance show significantly stronger positive correlations between adequacy of material resources and innovation project performance  implications for theory and practice are discussed  
 how ethically would americans and chinese negotiate  the effect of intra cultural versus inter cultural negotiations a growing body of research has started to examine how individuals from different countries may differ in their use of ethically questionable tactics during business negotiations  whereas prior research focused on the main effect of the national culture or nationality of the negotiator  we add a new factor  which is the nationality of the counterpart  looking at both these variables allows us to examine whether and how people may change their likelihood of using ethically questionable tactics in intercultural negotiations as opposed to intra cultural ones  results of an experiment  n   810  show that overall  american participants were less likely than chinese participants to use ethically questionable tactics in negotiations  however  american participants were more likely to use ethically questionable tactics  particularly those related to false promises and inappropriate information gathering  in inter cultural negotiations with chinese counterparts  than in intra cultural negotiations with american counterparts  by contrast  chinese participants were less likely to use ethically questionable tactics  particularly those related to false promises and attacking opponent s network  in inter cultural negotiations with american counterparts  than in intra cultural negotiations with chinese counterparts  implications and future directions are discussed  
 how excessive is banks  maturity transformation  we quantify the gains from regulating maturity transformation in a model of banks that finance long term assets with nontradable debt  banks choose the amount and maturity of their debt by trading off investors  preferences for short maturities with the risk of systemic crises  pecuniary externalities make unregulated debt maturities inefficiently short  in calibrating the model to eurozone banking data for 2006  we find that lengthening the average maturity of wholesale debt from 2 8 to 3 3 months would produce welfare gains with a present value of euro 105 billion  while the lengthening induced by the nsfr would be too drastic  
 how far can support go  supported supervisors  performance and subordinate dedication the present study builds on prior research involving organizational support theory and the trickle down effects of supervisors  perceived organizational support  pos   we examine benefits of supervisor pos for the supervisors themselves  enhanced affective commitment and in role performance   and a behavioral mechanism through which supervisors  pos may lead to subordinate dedication  a multifaceted conceptualization of performance  using three sources of data  from 139 human resource professionals  their 47 supervisors  and the 22 bosses of their supervisors  we assessed the hypothesized relationships using multilevel path modeling  supervisors  pos related positively to supervisors  affective commitment to their organization  resulting in better supervisor in role performance two months later  also  having better performing supervisors resulted in more dedication by employees in the form of extra role performance  as rated by their supervisor 2 months later  and extra hours worked  it appears providing organizational support to supervisors may result in beneficial outcomes for the supervisors and the organization in terms of supervisors  enhanced emotional attachment to the company  and better performance in their job  with consequences for subordinate dedication in terms of extra hours worked and extra role performance  these findings contribute to organizational support theory by showing initial evidence that supervisor in role performance can serve as an explanatory mechanism through which supervisors  pos trickles down to aid subordinates  
 how identity related goals moderate the role of attributes in product evaluation this research examines how identity related goals influence product evaluation  it is proposed that products are evaluated based on an attribute level to fulfill an identity related goal  further  the positive relationship between an attribute level and product evaluation is strengthened by goal activation  the degree to which a goal occupies a consumer s thinking  and goal product fit  the extent to which consumers think a product is related to a particular goal   results of three experimental studies support the above propositions  the research makes contributions in that it identifies two moderators  that is  goal activation and goal product fit  in the relationship between attributes ability and product evaluation  first  identity related goals are higher order and likely to have higher priority for consumers  however  results in this paper show that it still needs to be activated before it can exert an influence on attribute importance  specifically  when an identity related goal  e g   one supportive of the fair trade goal  is activated  it takes over a lower order goal  e g   seek for a good taste or a good priced coffee in this case   as goal activation increases  relevant attributes become more important  and the positive relationship between an attribute level and product evaluation strengthens  second  this paper introduces a new construct of goal product fit into identity related goals and product evaluation literature  the results of study three suggest that when goal product fit becomes stronger  the relevant attribute that can fulfill the goal becomes more important in the overall product evaluation  
 how media coverage of corporate social irresponsibility increases financial risk research summary  this article explores the relationship between corporate social irresponsibility  csi  and financial risk  we posit that media coverage of csi generates risk by providing conditions that increase the potential for stakeholder sanctions  through analyzing an international panel of 539 firms during 2008 2013  we find that firms receiving higher csi coverage face higher financial risk  we show that the reach of the reporting media outlet is a critical condition for this relationship  once the outlet has a high reach  the severity of csi coverage is a boundary condition that further reinforces the effect  our findings complement existing theory about the risk mitigating effect of corporate social responsibility by illuminating the risk generating effect of csi coverage  for executives  these insights suggest complementary strategies for corporate risk management  managerial summary  this article examines the effect of negative news on financial risk  it shows that negative media articles regarding environmental  social  and governance  esg  issues increase a firm s credit risk  it also provides a detailed analysis of the impact of an article s reach and severity  i e   how many readers are exposed to the article and how harshly it criticizes the firm  the results allow to quantitatively assess the risk that emanates from negative esg news  for executives  three strategies are derived for limiting a firm s exposure to this risk  balancing corporate social responsibility programs with operational safety programs  reporting suboptimal environmental and social performance transparently and proactively  and avoiding acquisition targets and markets with a legacy of negative news  copyright  c  2017 john wiley   sons  ltd  
 how much does ownership form matter  research summary  previous studies have emphasized firm and industry effects on variation in firm performance  but the relationship between forms of ownership and firm performance has been the focus of limited research  this article examines the extent to which ownership form  i e   public or private ownership  and ownership structure  including diffused ownership and blockholding  affect firm performance  the results of an analysis of 30 525 european union  eu  firms indicate that form of ownership is an important explanatory factor in the difference in performance among firms  these results underscore the need to study firms characterized by different ownership arrangements and to provide empirical evidence for the study of firm ownership in strategic management managerial summary  motivated by growing evidence on the involvement of different types of owners in the strategies of firms  we studied the extent to which a firm s ownership form  type of legal incorporation  such as public and private ownership forms  and ownership structure  diffused ownership and blockholding  affect its performance  our study of more than 30 000 firms from the european union shows that ownership form differences explain some of the performance differences between firms  our results also indicate that firms with different ownership forms are differently affected by their competitive environment  overall  the study suggests that choosing the right ownership form can have important strategic consequences  copyright  c  2017 john wiley   sons  ltd  
 how personal and organizational drivers impact on sme international performance  the mediating role of organizational innovation this article develops and tests a conceptual model to identify the impact of internal drivers  personal and organizational  on the international performance of small and medium sized enterprises  smes   drawing on the resource based view of the firm and its capability extensions  it is argued that the effect of drivers is mediated by organizational innovation  to test the proposed theoretical model  we collected data from 120 exporting smes in portugal  results show that the indirect mediating effect of innovation is particularly relevant with regard to the organizational driver performance link  insights contribute to research on the importance of innovation for capability and resource deployment during internationalization  
 how prevalent is academic misconduct in management research  we survey 1215 management researchers  including editors  researchers  and reviewers  about their views and experiences with four types of academic misconduct  plagiarism  self plagiarism  coercive citations  and questionable reviewing practices  management researchers hold strict views on plagiarism  though editors report on frequent instances encountered  we find that many management researchers consider self plagiarism acceptable  there is also a high percentage of editors who report on authors being coerced to add citations of reviewers or journals to their submission  similarly prevalent is so called  honorary authorship   where colleagues and supervisors who did not take part in the work are added as co authors  lastly  nearly half of the editors who responded report having witnessed conflicts of interest in peer reviewing  we conclude that the current system of peer reviewing is in need of change  and we discuss possible ramifications to overcome the persistence of academic misconduct

 how to commercialise university generated knowledge internationally  a comparative analysis of contingent institutional conditions our paper sets out to explore the contingent institutional conditions that underpin knowledge transfer  and particularly commercialisation  from universities to enterprises across national borders  we explore the phenomenon in four technology focused and research leading  in the national context  universities in estonia  india  portugal and the uk  we argue that participants in interactions  despite the fact that they maintain their core operations in different institutional fields  possess common knowledge bases  and shared norms and cognitive frameworks  in many cases however  the emergence of organisational rules to facilitate interactions do not lead to the institutionalisation of the processes at work  restricting the scope of both existing interactions and their advancement and offering a central role to nonpracticing entities  the paper advances university led pooling of intellectual property  geographically or sectorally  as an alternative for institutionalisation  
 how to manage long term financial self sufficiency of a national catastrophe insurance fund  the feasibility of three bailout programmes this paper shows the feasibility that a natural catastrophe insurance fund  ncif  may achieve financial self sufficiency via three bailout programmes  including pre funding  loan financing and equity financing  to support the insurers during the bad years  under such programmes  different accounting procedures for the insurers and ncif are developed to simulate their 30 year cash flows based on the best fitting loss model calibrated by the global insured loss data  the numerical analysis results indicate that the proposed programmes can balance the financial revenue and expenditure of ncif in the long term  and this conclusion implies the authority can develop similar schemes as ncif to smooth the peak risk of natural catastrophes

 hurting without hitting  the economic cost of political tension political tension that causes diplomatic strain rarely escalates into direct violence or war  this paper identifies the economic effects of such non violent political tension by examining taiwan s sovereignty debate  non violent events harming the relationship with mainland china lead to an average daily drop of 200 basis points in taiwanese stock returns  the impact is more severe on firms openly supporting the taiwanese pro independence party  through a series of tests  we show that this economic penalty is targeted at proindependence firms that are economically exposed to mainland china via either investments or exports   c  2017 elsevier b v  all rights reserved  
 hybrid organizations and the logics of entrepreneurial ecosystems growing evidence suggests entrepreneurial ecosystems are a potent engine for economic and community development  prior research has identified an ecosystem s culture as serving a critical role in its creation and functioning  however  it is not clear how the cultural forces in entrepreneurial ecosystems develop and are shaped by individuals  organizational actors  and ecosystem level institutions  drawing from institutional theory and theories of multiple logic organizations  i e   hybrids   this paper combines entrepreneurship and management research to argue that entrepreneurial ecosystems are influenced by two dominant institutional logics  entrepreneurial market and community  by combining both logics  hybrid support organizations  such as incubators  accelerators  and small business development centers  play a unique role in entrepreneurial ecosystems by exposing participants to the two guiding logics  furthermore  it is argued that intra ecosystem variation among hybrid support organizations in the dominance of entrepreneurial market and community logics  will result in a diversity of entrepreneurship within an ecosystem  this theorizing contributes to the understanding of entrepreneurial ecosystems by shedding light on the role institutional logics and hybrid support organizations play in ecosystem formation  structuring  and function and by explaining the genesis of the cultural values that guide ecosystem participants  
 i hate where it comes from but i still buy it  countervailing influences of animosity and nostalgia drawing from negativity bias  fading affect bias  and ambivalence literature  we provide evidence that consumer nostalgia acts as a countervailing force to consumer animosity in historically connected markets  hcms   that is  trading countries that previously were part of the same country but are now independent  for both soviet era and  new  russian brands  our findings show that nostalgia can compensate for the negative effects of animosity on product judgment and product ownership in hcms characterized by intense negative past events  lithuania   in contrast  in hcms experiencing current recent negative events  ukraine  animosity is a stronger predictor of product judgment and ownership than nostalgia  importantly  in both hcm settings  consumer ethnocentrism only plays a minor role when both nostalgia and animosity are simultaneously considered as predictors in the model  theoretical and managerial implications of the findings are considered and future research directions are identified  
 idiosyncratic risk and the manager we develop a model to characterize and quantify the effects of stock  option  and fixed compensation on a manager s risk taking incentive and investment choice  we find the average chief executive officer s  ceo  compensation contract incentivizes overinvestment by 1 3 percentage points per year  with significant variation across firms and over time  we estimate a value of ceo effort implied by compensation contracts and find it to be strongly related to firm intangibility  finally  we assess the effects on investment of fas 123r and a hypothetical ban on option grants and find heterogeneous responses that depend on firm volatility and the prior structure of compensation   c  2017 elsevier b v  all rights reserved  
 if it has lots of bells and whistles  it must be the best  how maximizers and satisficers evaluate feature rich versus feature poor products past studies have largely focused on how maximizers versus satisficers choose among multiple products within a given consideration set  by contrast  our research focuses on how and why maximizers evaluate an individual product based on a salient characteristic the number of features that it has  across two studies  we find that maximizers evaluate products more favorably than satisficers when they have many features  i e   they are  feature rich    but not when they have few features  i e   they are  feature poor    further  we outline the process underlying this effect  maximizers are more likely than satisficers to perceive feature rich  vs  feature poor  products as a means of signaling status to others  we additionally identify a boundary condition supporting this proposed theoretical process  specifically  we demonstrate that when maximizers no longer perceive feature rich products as status signals  they do not evaluate them more favorably than satisficers  
 impact of board gender diversity on dividend payments  evidence from some emerging economies this study investigates the impact of board gender diversity on dividend payments in the context of emerging economies  using a dataset of listed firms from india  china and russia over the period 2007 2014  we find strong and robust evidence indicating that board gender diversity is negatively related to cash dividend payments in all emerging economies  moreover  we find that state ownership positively moderates the relationship between gender diversity and dividend payments  however  this effect is observed only for china and russia  in additional analyses  we find that the negative link between board gender diversity and dividend payments is more pronounced during the financial crisis  however  the moderating role of state ownership does not remain significant during the financial crisis  
 impact of interest rate surprises on islamic and conventional stocks and bonds this paper studies the impact of interest rate news surprises on islamic and conventional stock and bond indices  using a dataset which covers interest rate announcements and forecasts  as well as stock and bond indices in three islamic and eight non islamic countris  we find that interest rate surprises tend to have a smaller impact on the returns and volatility of islamic than conventional bonds because islamic bonds are structured to avoid explicit interest rates  however  interest rate surprises have about the same or bigger impact on the returns and volatility of islamic relative to conventional stocks  despite the low amounts of cash and debt holdings of firms comprising islamic stock indices   c  2017 elsevier ltd  all rights reserved  
 impact of international capital flows on emerging markets  sovereign risk premium   demand vs  vulnerability effect in recent years many developing economies attracted significant foreign capital  an increased share of non residents in public debt affects sovereign bond yields in two opposing ways  triggering a downward pressure on yields in reaction to increased demand  and an upward pressure reflective of overreliance on external funding and greater vulnerability to sudden stops of capital inflows  based on panel cointegration analysis of 14 emerging economies  this study   contrary to previous empirical literature   indicates that in the long run the positive signed vulnerability effect may prevail over the negative signed demand effect  though with significant heterogeneity across countries   c  2017 elsevier inc  all rights reserved  
 impact of short selling restrictions on informed momentum trading  australian evidence we examine the impact of short selling restrictions on the momentum strategy returns of australian equities during the global financial crisis  gfc   momentum strategy is based on a long position in a winner portfolio comprising of the previous 10  best performing stocks and a short position in a loser portfolio comprising of the previous 10  worst performing stocks  we find that momentum strategy during the gfc are less profitable compared to the pre gfc period  momentum returns are negatively correlated to the short sales restrictions  and that loser portfolios rather than winner portfolios drive this result  these momentum returns are robust to transaction costs and liquidity effects  an explanation is that the imposition of the short selling restrictions by the australian securities and investments commission from september 2008 to may 2009 may have moderated the ability for momentum traders to profit from the short sale of loser portfolios  however  informed momentum profits are attributable to the loser portfolio across the holding periods of 3 to 12 months  which implies that informed institutional traders take advantage of their private information to overcome adverse selection costs  this enables them to short sell their loser portfolios and carry out their momentum trading strategies   c  2017 elsevier b v  all rights reserved  
 impacts of low citizen awareness and usage in smart city services  the case of london s smart parking system smart city applications and services are increasingly considered as strategic means to cope with emerging global challenges such as climate change  pollution  the ageing population  and energy shortage  in particular  smart parking is a type of smart services used to improve traffic congestion and pollution within cities  nevertheless  although smart city services are driven by advanced information technologies  their success is highly dependent on user engagement  which is historically problematic  this paper presents and discusses the results of a case study on the smart parking service in london  a questionnaire  involved a total of 212 local drivers  was adopted as the main data collection method  this was complemented by the collection and analysis of 470 online user comments left for the service  the results showed that london s smart parking service may potentially help each driver to save an average of a 68 pound  62 2 l  on petrol annually and reduce co2 emissions by 238 14 kg per car per year  at city level  a smart parking system could help london save a 183 6 pound million worth of petrol per year and reduce its annual co2 emissions by 642 978 tons  however  public awareness  actual usage  and user satisfaction of this smart service are currently very low  these present substantial barriers to realise the potential economic and environmental benefits of the service  this paper concluded that further to the very technological efforts  local authorities and service providers need to make a stronger endeavour to enhance public engagement and user satisfaction towards smart services  in order to realise the promises of such solutions  
 impacts of product type and representation type on the perception of justice and price fairness consumers make purchasing decisions every day  this paper investigates perceptions of justice and price unfairness  where the product  hedonic vs  utilitarian  is presented either in a more abstract  verbal  or a more concrete  photo  way in a context of discriminatory pricing a widely employed marketing practice  two experimental studies were completed  results show an interaction between product and representation types  when consumers pay more than others to purchase utilitarian products that are concretely represented  participants perceive more unfairness when compared to hedonic products  however  when consumers pay more than others to purchase utilitarian products abstractly represented  the perception of unfairness decreased compared to hedonic products  for consumers and practitioners  this study offers important contributions it presents situations in which a discriminatory price can result in a different perception of injustice or price unfairness to informed consumers  accordingly  implications of these findings for the literature  consumers  and managers are discussed   c  2017 elsevier inc  all rights reserved  
 implementation of green innovations   the impact of stakeholders and their network relations green innovation is becoming increasingly important for companies and whole societies  and the research in this field has essentially increased in recent years  as green innovation is expected to ensure both environmental sustainability and economical profitability  it might seriously affect the partly colliding interests of various groups of stakeholders  however  from previous studies less is known about the impact that various groups of stakeholders and particularly the relationships among these stakeholders exert on the implementation of green innovations  to address this gap we first substantiate the relevance of the stakeholder theory for innovation studies in general and green innovations in particular  furthermore  we argue that from the innovator s perspective green innovations are likely to be affected by the interactions with as well as between many primary and secondary stakeholders  to explore this issue in depth we conducted a case study of the implementation of an offshore wind farm in germany  our research revealed that network ties among stakeholders can be both conducive and detrimental to the green innovation  the insights gained in our study contribute to the stakeholder analysis for the implementation of green innovations  
 implications of customer value perceptions for the design of electricity efficiency services in times of smart metering smart meters are the backbone of modern electricity metering and an important enabler of reaching energy efficiency targets  the implementation of new metering infrastructure is  however  making little progress and is often focused on technical aspects only  additionally  existing smart metering information systems do not yet exploit the possibilities to optimally support customers in their electricity savings activities  knowing customer preferences is absolutely essential for the effectiveness of energy efficiency measures and  as a consequence  for realizing the economic value of smart metering technology  the presented research contributes to the field by identifying customer value perceptions concerning new smart meter services in the retail electricity market in switzerland  founded on a choice based conjoint analysis with a data sample of more than 1500 respondents from three swiss regions  five customer segments with different preferences are identified  with the exception of the comfort oriented customer segment  the other four segments are comprised of customers who are willing  1  to pay for smart meter services and  2  to change their behavior to save electricity  based on the identified customer value perceptions  implications for the design of smart meter based energy efficiency services are elaborated  
 implications of parent brand inertia for multiproduct pricing this paper explores and quantifies the importance of parent brand state dependence to forward looking pricing outcomes in the area of umbrella branding and multi product firms  we show through numerical simulations that loyalty  inertia  to the parent brand can decrease prices and reduce profits  as well as mitigate or even reverse the benefits of joint profit maximization relative to sub brand profit maximization  these effects are mediated by brand asymmetries and the relative magnitude of sub brand state dependence effects  empirically  we focus on the yogurt category  where we consider parent brands with several sub brands  using household level scanner data  we estimate the parameters that characterize consumer demand while flexibly accounting for consumer heterogeneity  we also estimate unobserved product costs based on a forward looking price setting game  through counterfactual analysis  we study the overall effect of parent brand state dependence on prices and profits  as well as the empirical impact of joint profit maximization and changes in firms  beliefs regarding consumer inertia  our findings have implications for markets where demand is likely characterized by parent brand dynamics  
 impression management use in resumes and cover letters this study contributes to the ecological validity of resume research by systematically examining the impression management  im  content of actual resumes and cover letters and empirically testing the effect on applicant evaluation  a content analysis of the frequency and intensity of im tactic use in 60 resumes and cover letters was completed  study 1   next  an experiment was conducted in which im tactic use was manipulated and the effect on applicant evaluation examined  using a sample of mturk workers as evaluators  study 2   in study 1  four self promotion categories  three ingratiation categories  and one hybrid category were delineated  in study 2  ingratiation and lower intensity self promotion were found to increase perceptions of job and organization fit  employers should be aware that resumes and cover letters contain im tactics that may influence applicant evaluation  in addition  employment training programs might communicate the benefits of using ingratiation and lower intensity self promotion  while emphasizing the importance of accurately conveying one s qualifications  furthermore  the present taxonomy of im resume content might be applied to resume database search engines to identify and index im tactic use  this research is the first to develop a taxonomy of im tactics based on actual resumes and cover letters and may facilitate more comprehensive manipulations of im tactic use and better integration of im research across the selection process

 in search for managerial skills beyond common performance measures one caveat of current literature on the value of active management is the lack of treatment for the performance measures that can be gamed  we propose to use the performance measure that can t be manipulated with respect to the underlying distribution  time variation  nor estimation error   the manipulation proof performance measure  mppm  goetzmann et al   2007    to rank all active u s  domestic equity mutual funds from 1980 to 2013 on a quarterly basis to analyze managerial skills  we find fund managers in the higher ranked persistently outperform lower ranked managers by posting higher gross and net fund returns  higher holding based returns  and generating positive return gap  analyzing the holdings of the portfolios indicates higher ranked managers hold stocks with higher information asymmetry  especially the growth companies that are younger  smaller  and with lower liquidity  our results show that the spread on gross and net fund returns between highest ranked and the lowest ranked fund managers is between 49 and 52 basis points per month  the holding returns are statistically significant for up to six months indicating the stock picking skills exist for those higher ranked managers  even though mppm identifies managerial skills  the positive alphas may not be warranted due to their operating expenses   c  2015 elsevier b v  all rights reserved  
 in search of the dominant rationale in sustainability management  legitimacy  or profit seeking  the academic debate why and how companies are dealing with sustainability is dominated by two main arguments the profit seeking and the legitimacy seeking view  while the first argues that companies  only  establish sustainability management measures if this helps to increase their economic success  others emphasize that companies predominantly react on societal pressure dealing with sustainability  only  to secure legitimacy  whereas both lines of argument have gained a lot of attention in academia  little is known about their relative importance in shaping corporate practice  this papers aims to fill this gap with an empirical analysis of corporate practices of large companies in ten countries worldwide  to capture the organizations  rationale in sustainability management practice  we systematically applied various measures related to actors and operational activities focusing on the companies  intention to pursue sustainability management  the integration of sustainability management to the core business  and the actual implementation of related measures  overall the findings indicate that seeking legitimacy dominates corporate sustainability management practices  
 in store pickup and returns for a dual channel retailer the internet and technology have changed how products are sold and delivered to consumers  today  the most significant growth in online retailing comes from multichannel retailers that sell products both in stores and over the internet  recently  these retail e tail organizations have attempted to leverage their  brick  locations by allowing customers to pick up or return orders purchased online at retail store locations  such options let online customers avoid both long carrier lead times and high shipping costs  however  these options come at a cost to the retailer  this paper develops a mathematical model for analytically examining the cost and value of providing in store pickup and return options in multi echelon retail e tail organizations  in this light  the model determines the optimal subset of a retailer e tailer s stores that should be set up to handle in store pickups and online returns under stochastic channel demands  computational results show that optimizing the set of pickup and return locations can reduce system cost by up to 20  on average over arbitrarily enabling all stores with internet pickup return capabilities  and firms can substantially increase customer value while maintaining cost minimization as an important selection criterion in choosing pickup and return locations

 incentive for innovation and the optimal allocation of patents this article theoretically investigates how different ownership structures of patents affect ex ante and ex post incentives for innovation by applying a property rights approach  we explore a model in which two research laboratories invest in r d to obtain an innovative patent  and after successfully obtaining the patent they determine an ownership structure for the patent  the two parties consider how the determined patent ownership would affect their noncontractible relation specific investments for commercialisation  we demonstrate that joint ownership of a patent between two parties is optimal  more concretely  if a selfish  altruistic  relation specific investment is more important than an altruistic  selfish  investment  a joint ownership with no  bilateral  veto is optimal to maximise the joint value  moreover  when both parties do not commit themselves to joint ownership in advance  they have greater incentive to invest in r d than committing  even if they understand that joint ownership is desirable ex post  
 incentive redesign and collaboration in organizations  evidence from a natural experiment research summary  separating the individual from the social effects of incentives has been challenging because of the possibility of synergies in team production  we observe a unique natural experiment in a south korean e commerce company in which a switch from pay for performance to fixed  but different  salaries took place in a staggered and effectively random manner across employees  in this case  social and individual effects perspectives make opposing predictions  enabling a critical test  we find evidence consistent with social effects of incentives  particularly as predicted by goal framing theory  the results have implications for the design of incentives to foster collaboration  organizational learning  and organizational performance managerial summary  managers often neglect the deeper hypothesis behind pay for performance schemesthat people primarily care about how much they are individually paid  an opposing school of thought contends that incentives have social effects toothat individuals care about not only what they receive but also what their peers receive  it is difficult to say whether individual or social effects would be more salient in a context  without a proper experiment with randomization  we exploit a rare opportunity provided by a company that changed its incentive system in a random order  thus unintentionally creating a natural experiment  the results strongly validate the existence of social effects of incentives  but also make the general case for the opportunity to learn from experimenting with organization design in a systematic manner  copyright  c  2017 john wiley   sons  ltd  
 income insurance and the equilibrium term structure of equity output  wages  and dividends feature term structures of variance ratios that are respectively flat  increasing  and decreasing  income insurance from shareholders to workers explains these term structures  risk sharing smooths wages but only concerns transitory risk and hence enhances short run dividend risk  as a result  actual labor share variation largely forecasts the risk  premium  and slope of dividend strips  a simple general equilibrium model in which labor rigidity affects dividend dynamics and the price of short run risk reconciles standard asset pricing facts with the term structures of the equity premium  volatility  and macroeconomic variables  which are at odds in leading models  
 increasing the impact of collective incentives in payments for ecosystem services collective payments for ecosystem services  pes  programs make payments to groups  conditional on specified aggregate land management outcomes  such collective contracting may be well suited to settings with communal land tenure or decision making  given that collective contracting does not require costly individual level information on outcomes  it may also facilitate conditioning on additionality  i e   conditioning payments upon clearly improved outcomes relative to baseline   yet collective contracting often suffers from free riding  which undermines group outcomes and may be exacerbated or ameliorated by pes designs  we study impacts of conditioning on additionality within a number of collective pes designs  we use a framed field laboratory experiment with participants from a new pes program in mexico  because social interactions are critical within collective processes  we assess the impacts from conditioning on additionality given   1  group participation in contract design  and  2  a group coordination mechanism  conditioning on above baseline outcomes raised contributions  particularly among initially lower contributors  group participation in contract design increased impact  as did the coordination mechanism   c  2017 the authors  published by elsevier inc  
 indigenous land rights and deforestation  evidence from the brazilian amazon concerns over the expropriation of and encroachment on indigenous communities  lands have led to greater formalization of these communities  rights in a number of developing countries  we study whether formalization of indigenous communities  land rights affects the rate of deforestation in both the short and medium terms  beginning in 1995  the government of brazil formalized the rights of several hundred indigenous communities whose lands cover more than 40 million hectares in the amazon region and provided support for these rights  enforcement  we study the program s impacts using a long time series of satellite based forest cover data  using both plausibly exogenous variation in the timing of formalization and matched samples of treated and comparison communities  we find no effect of these protections on satellite based greenness measures  this is true even for communities that received support for surveillance and enforcement of these rights  notably  we observe low counterfactual rates of deforestation on communities  lands between 1982 and 2010  suggesting that indigenous land rights programs should not uniformly be justified on the basis of their forest protection  at least in the medium term   c  2017 elsevier inc  all rights reserved  
 individualism  democracy  and contract enforcement we examine a potential link between culture and financial development by considering culture s influence on contract enforcement regulation  specifically  we investigate the role of individualism in determining the variation in enforcement costs across countries  individualism positively and significantly relates to efficient contract enforcement  an association that is independent of a particular political system  interaction effects  however  suggest that democracy magnifies individualism s influence on the contract enforcement efficiency  these results provide insight into how culture can shape financial outcomes  it further suggests that culture serves as a constraint on policymakers  as any given policy or formal institutional structure will function very differently depending on the cultural environment   c  2017 elsevier b v  all rights reserved

 informational rigidities and the stickiness of temporary sales how do retailers react to cost changes  while temporary sales account for 95  of price change in our data  retail prices respond to a wholesale cost increase entirely through the regular price  sales actually respond temporarily in the opposite direction from regular prices  as though to conceal the price hike  additional evidence from responses to commodity cost and local unemployment shocks  as well as broader evidence from bls data  reinforces these findings  institutional evidence indicates that sales are complex contingent contracts  determined substantially in advance  in a standard price discrimination model  these institutional practices leave little money  on the table    c  2017 elsevier b v  all rights reserved  
 informed short selling around seo announcements while much of the prior research on short selling around announcements of seasoned equity offerings  seos  has focused on manipulation  it is unclear whether there is also informed short selling around these announcements  we test for informed short selling around seo announcements by examining the relation between i  pre announcement short selling and the announcement period return and ii  changes in short interest around the seo announcement and the long term operating and stock price performance following the equity issue  we find that firms with large increases in short interest prior to the seo announcement exhibit lower  i e   more negative  announcement period returns  and that firms with large increases in short interest around the seo announcement experience inferior long term operating and stock price performance following the equity issue  we also find that the negative relation between large increases in short interest and long term operating and stock price performance is more pronounced among shelf offers  this result highlights the informational role of short sellers in identifying opportunistic market timers of equity issues among shelf filers  our overall results indicate the presence of informed short selling around seo announcements   c  2017 elsevier b v  all rights reserved  
 informed trading and the price impact of block trades  a high frequency trading analysis using high frequency data from the london stock exchange  lse   we investigate the relationship between informed trading and the price impact of block trades on intraday and inter day basis  price impact of block trades is stronger during the first hour of trading  this is consistent with the hypothesis that information accumulates overnight during non trading hours  furthermore  private information is gradually incorporated into prices despite heightened trading frequency  evidence suggests that informed traders exploit superior information across trading days  and stocks with lower transparency exhibit stronger information diffusion effects when traded in blocks  thus informed block trading facilitates price discovery   c  2016 elsevier inc  all rights reserved

 institutional imprinting  entrepreneurial agency  and private firm innovation in transition economies we study private firm innovation at an advanced stage of institutional transition in central and eastern europe and the commonwealth of independent states  we adopt an integrated view  where the institution based view of strategy is complemented by institutional imprints and entrepreneurial agency to argue that innovation at that stage of transition depends on private firm founding conditions earlier during the transition and on recent strategic initiatives to exploit specific opportunities  improving the innovation capacity of firms  in a ten country sample of 2322 private firms  we find that firms founded earlier and those of larger size at inception are better at innovation because of imprints favoring network based approaches  innovation is even greater when these firms  top manager has less industry experience  suggesting complementarity between network  and resource based approaches  additionally  firms that upgrade their management knowledge and improve their operational efficiency achieve higher innovation  and the effect of the former is augmented with a greater foreign market focus  our findings also suggest that the role of entrepreneurial agency is stronger than that of institutional imprinting  these results have important implications for the institution based view of strategy and private firm innovation in transition economies of cee and cis  
 institutional logics  family firm governance and performance positive and negative views of family firms and their performance abound  although there have been explanations for this divergence based on conditions of governance and context  the institutional environment has been less thoroughly explored as a source of these differences  we argue that the blend of family and market institutional logics in the regional communities where firms operate can have an important impact on the governance arrangements and financial performance of family firms  specifically  we find that family intensive governance is more common where family logic predominates in a region  and does best when this logic remains at modest levels or is countered by market logic  we test and support these notions in a comprehensive sample of private family firms in italy  an ideal context in which distinct historically determined logics exists among its 20 regions   c  2017 elsevier inc  all rights reserved

 integrating social protection strategies for improved impact  a comparative evaluation of cash transfers and index insurance in kenya social protection programmes aim to use public funds to reduce poverty and vulnerability  cash transfers have proven to be an effective social protection strategy in many contexts but are extremely expensive  researchers have suggested that integrating multiple interventions could improve the efficiency of protection programmes  but there are few evidence based recommendations on how to best implement such approaches  this study uses household level panel data to estimate the marginal impacts of observed cash and index insurance transfers  subsidies  on household income in northern kenya  those estimates are used to simulate sample level poverty indices as the outcome of a standard cash transfer programme and of a similar programme that reallocates a small portion of the budget as an insurance subsidy to the vulnerable  we find that the integrated programme reduces poverty to a greater degree than do cash transfers alone  highlighting the importance of protecting the vulnerable in addition to supporting the poorest

 interest rate derivatives use in banking  market pricing implications of cash flow hedges we examine whether investors are able to fully anticipate the pricing implications of cash flow hedges in the banking industry  we show that mark to market adjustments on cash flow hedges are inversely related to future cash flows and that investors underestimate the extent of this inverse relation  our evidence supports the notion that incomplete information on value relevant parameters makes it difficult for investors to accurately predict the effects of current cash flow hedge adjustments on future cash flows  our results are also consistent with the evidence that investors have limited attention such that information  particularly information that is difficult to discern  is not fully reflected in stock prices  thus  the additional disclosures mandated by regulatory agencies in the banking industry are not sufficient to overcome the challenges associated with incomplete information and investors  limited attention   c  2017 elsevier b v  all rights reserved  
 interest rate risk management and the mix of fixed and floating rate debt we analyze the after swap mix of fixed and floating rate debt in a sample of non financial firms  using hand collected data from a window of time when derivative positions were included in accounting disclosures  to motivate the analyses  we present a simple theoretical model that highlights the special features of interest rate risk  consistent with the theory  we find that firms that issue more fixed rate debt have higher liquidity ratios and lower operating income ratios  we also document that individual firms actively vary the proportion of their fixed rate debt to a strikingly high extent  there is a debate as to whether such variation should be interpreted as hedging or speculation  we show that the firms more actively varying their debt mix respond to different hedging motives than those with low activity  we then empirically motivate an alternative indicator of speculative activity  co variation between ex post profitability of financial decisions and operating results   c  2017 elsevier b v  all rights reserved  
 intermediary asset pricing  new evidence from many asset classes we find that shocks to the equity capital ratio of financial intermediaries primary dealer counterparties of the new york federal reserve possess significant explanatory power for cross sectional variation in expected returns  this is true not only for commonly studied equity and government bond market portfolios  but also for other more sophisticated asset classes such as corporate and sovereign bonds  derivatives  commodities  and currencies  our intermediary capital risk factor is strongly procyclical  implying countercyclical intermediary leverage  the price of risk for intermediary capital shocks is consistently positive and of similar magnitude when estimated separately for individual asset classes  suggesting that financial intermediaries are marginal investors in many markets and hence key to understanding asset prices   c  2017 elsevier b v  all rights reserved

 international stock return predictability  evidence from new statistical tests we investigate whether stock returns of international markets are predictable from a range of fundamentals including key financial ratios  dividend price ratio  dividend yield  earnings price ratio  dividend payout ratio   technical indicators  price pressure  change in volume   and short term interest rates  we adopt two new alternative testing and estimation methods  the improved augmented regression method and wild bootstrapping of predictive model based on a restricted var form  both methods take explicit account of endogeneity of predictors  providing bias reduced estimation and improved statistical inference in small samples  from monthly data of 16 asia pacific  including u s   and 21 european stock markets from 2000 to 2014  we find that the financial ratios show weak predictive ability with small effect sizes and poor out of sample forecasting performances  in contrast  the price pressure and interest rate are found to be strong predictors for stock return with large effect sizes and satisfactory out of sample forecasting performance   c  2016 elsevier inc  all rights reserved

 internationalization strategy and the home regionalization hypothesis  the case of australian multinational enterprises in this study  we set out to  first  replicate the classification of multinational enterprise  mne  types proposed by rugman and verbeke in the australian context  second  we explore how a firm s international experience influences the degree of its home regionalization and how industry affects the international experience home regionalization relationship  we find that while home regionalization is still a dominant regionalization strategy for australian mnes  the proportions are different from those of rugman and verbeke  in particular  the share of home regional firms is less pronounced and the share of host regional firms is higher than rugman and verbeke s findings  we also find that a firm s international experience is negatively related to home regionalization  and that this relationship is further moderated by the firm s industry  our findings suggest that more attention be devoted to uncovering both home country effects and the differential impact of international experience on home regionalization across industries  
 interorganizational imitation and acquisitions of high tech ventures research summary  this article shows that there is a positive association between the changes in the number of prior acquisitions or the changes in the prominence of prior acquirers within the focal venture s subfield and the venture s likelihood to be acquired  results are in line with the existence of frequency  and trait based imitation in acquisitions targeting tech ventures  more importantly  these positive associations are more pronounced when  a  exogenous technological uncertainty within the venture s subfield increases and  b  there are significant differences between the focal venture s and acquirer s technological resources  our findings are in accord with the suggestion that uncertainty in the technology domain is an important boundary condition in moderating the extent of imitation in technology acquisitions  we also discuss alternative explanations and implications managerial summary  the findings of this article suggest that when deciding whether or not to acquire a technology venture  i e   startup company in a high tech industry   managers infer information by observing other acquisitions in the venture s subfield to make assessments about the underlying value of the potential targets  we also find that receiving some informational cues from previous acquisitions would be more useful when there is high technological uncertainty in the potential target s subfield about which technologies will be dominant  and when the potential acquirer and the tech venture operate in dissimilar technological areas  this article shows that imitation can be one way to deal with decision making under uncertainty when making acquisition decisions in high tech environments  copyright  c  2017 john wiley   sons  ltd  
 interpreting the stock returns to new product announcements  how the past shapes investors  expectations of the future investors routinely follow firms  communications and actions to form expectations about the firms  future performance  the authors propose a set of firm and industry characteristics that influence the formation of investor expectations in the context of new product announcements  specifically  they argue that positive expectations of future innovation output should cause an ex ante increase in stock prices and a smaller expost market reaction when an actual new product is announced  using a sample of 4 865 new product announcements made by 826 publicly traded u  s  firms  the authors show that the stock market reaction to a new product announcement measured in a five day window around the announcement is negatively related to  1  the number of new products previously announced by the firm   2  the average number of new products previously announced by the firm s competitors  and  3  the average sentiment of past public news about the firm  these three factors are also positively related to the market value of the firm measured immediately before each new announcement  controlling for increases in firm value directly attributable to past new product announcements  in contrast to many articles in the marketing literature that imply that the added value of a marketing event can be fully assessed from the stock market reaction to the announcement of the event  the authors clarify that for recurrent events or events that are part of a firm s broader strategy  this reaction reflects only an update of investors  expectations of future firm performance  
 intra  and inter regional portfolio diversification strategies under regional market integration  evidence from us global banks this study empirically assesses whether being a part of any specific region affects global banks  decisions on capital allocation across 20 developed and 44 emerging markets by using data on u s  banks in the period from 2006 to 2015  we find that both the intra bank lending of a parent bank to its affiliates abroad and the local lending of foreign affiliates decrease as internal lending to neighboring countries within a region increases  this finding provides evidence of the negative spillover or contagion effects from regional allocations on the capital allocation of global banks to individual economies  our findings reflect that financial markets are integrated within the region  which suggests no intra regional diversification benefits to the united states or to other global investors  moreover  parent banks  intra bank lending translates into foreign affiliates  local lending in the host country  a policy implication is that countries in the same region should strengthen coordinated efforts to ensure free intra regional capital mobility and diversify country specific risk  the findings of this study can help enhance our understanding of the relationships between financial markets interconnectedness and global banks  portfolio management strategies   c  2017 elsevier inc  all rights reserved

 intraday online investor sentiment and return patterns in the us stock market we implement a novel approach to derive investor sentiment from messages posted on social media before we explore the relation between online investor sentiment and intraday stock returns  using an extensive dataset of messages posted on the microblogging platform stocktwits  we construct a lexicon of words used by online investors when they share opinions and ideas about the bullishness or the bearishness of the stock market  we demonstrate that a transparent and replicable approach significantly outperforms standard dictionary based methods used in the literature while remaining competitive with more complex machine learning algorithms  aggregating individual message sentiment at half hour intervals  we provide empirical evidence that online investor sentiment helps forecast intraday stock index returns  after controlling for past market returns  we find that the first half hour change in investor sentiment predicts the last half hour s p 500 index etf return  examining users  self reported investment approach  holding period and experience level  we find that the intraday sentiment effect is driven by the shift in the sentiment of novice traders  overall  our results provide direct empirical evidence of sentiment driven noise trading at the intraday level   c  2017 elsevier b v  all rights reserved

 investigating links between cultural orientation and culture outcomes  immigrants from the former soviet union to israel and germany marketers are justifiably interested in ethnic consumers  formulating effective ethnic marketing strategies requires insights into these consumers  attitudes and behaviors  however  prior research provides few insights into how different cultural environments might shape the consumption behavior of consumers with the same cultural heritage  to address this knowledge gap  the present study examines the cultural orientation and relevant consumer outcomes  i e   desire for unique products and fashion consciousness  of immigrants from the former soviet union who move to israel and germany  the results reveal differences in the cultural orientations of immigrants to israel versus germany  as well as different relational patterns between cultural orientation and the proposed consumer outcomes  these findings provide both theoretical and managerial implications  
 investigating non visitors  intentions to travel to a long haul holiday destination this article aims to expand our understanding of the main drivers of traveler s intention to visit a long haul holiday destination drawing on a model of consumer based brand equity  the authors propose and test a conceptual model using data from a sample of 152 chilean travelers who have not visited australia previously  the findings show that the image and value of australia are positively and significantly related to chilean traveler s intention to visit this destination for holidays  awareness of australia has only an indirect effect on intentions to visit this destination through its effect on brand image  finally  perceptions of brand quality were not significantly related to chilean traveler s intention to visit australia for holidays  this study contributes to the tourism and leisure literature by identifying the main drivers for attracting long haul potential travelers who have not visited the destination previously  
 investigating the effect of quality of grammar and mechanics  qgam  in online reviews  the mediating role of reviewer crediblity grammar and mechanics are important components of written communication and provide signals of credibility  although past research has documented general effects of grammar and mechanics  to date  the influence of quality of grammar and mechanics  qgam  of online reviews remains largely unexamined  through the lens of elm  the present research examines qgam of a review as a peripheral cue influencing the perceived credibility of a reviewer  finding that reviews with high qgam have higher perceived credibility and exert a stronger influence on purchase intentions  meanwhile  reviews with low qgam are not as credible  influencing purchase intentions less  product type  review length  and review valence moderate these influences  such that qgam is more important for reviews of experience goods and reviews of shorter lengths  further  reviewer credibility fully mediates positive reviews but does not mediate negative reviews  implications  limitations  and future research directions are discussed  
 investments and risk transfers we demonstrate a novel link between relationship specific investments and risk in a setting where division managers operate under moral hazard and collaborate on joint projects  specific investments increase efficiency at the margin  this expands the scale of operations and thereby adds to the compensation risk borne by the managers  accounting for this investment risk link overturns key findings from prior incomplete contracting studies  we find that if the investing manager has full bargaining power vis a vis the other manager  he will underinvest relative to the benchmark of contractible investments  with equal bargaining power  however  he may overinvest  the reason is that the investing manager internalizes only his own share of the investment induced risk premium  we label this a  risk transfer    whereas the principal internalizes both managers  incremental risk premia  we show that high pay performance sensitivity  pps  reduces the managers  incentives to invest in relationship specific assets  the optimal pps  thus  trades off investment and effort incentives  
 investor attention  analyst recommendation revisions  and stock prices we provide evidence that investors underreact after analysts  recommendation upgrades  however  price reactions are faster after downgrades  we measure individual investors  attention using google s search volume index  our findings indicate that  after upgrades  stocks that enjoy greater individual investors  attention underreact significantly more compared to stocks that receive high level of attention from institutional investors  on the other hand  after recommendation downgrades  stocks with higher levels of prior attention from individual investors overreact and show a significantly greater price reversal compared to stocks that received high level of attention from institutional investors  our results suggest that attentive individual investors may not be rational  hence investor attention and investor sophistication are important for price discovery in the market   c  2016 published by elsevier b v  
 investor familiarity and corporate debt financing conditions this study contributes to our understanding of how retail bondholders value familiarity with the issuer  using a sample of corporate bonds issued by german non financials and especially marketed to individual investors  we document that   besides product market visibility   three previously unconsidered antecedents of investor familiarity  i e  local visibility  media visibility and overall recognition of the bond issuing company  are negatively associated with credit spreads  given that company visibility does not necessarily result in a reduction of fundamental risk for the group of bondholders  the finding that higher familiarity relates to lower risk premia suggests heuristic decision behaviour among retail investors where a familiarity bias reduces the perceived risk of bond investments   c  2017 elsevier inc  all rights reserved  
 investor inattention around stock market holidays we observe three results that lead to the conclusion investors are distracted by holidays  first  there is a substantial reduction in the trading volume adjacent to weekday stock market closings  second  there are considerably fewer stocks with extreme abnormal returns in the trading days adjacent to a holiday  third  those stocks with extreme abnormal returns in the trading days adjacent to a holiday drift on the subsequent trading day  these findings do not hold for weekend stock market closings  the evidence supports the hypothesis of inattentive investors  whose reactions are suppressed in the quiet trading sessions surrounding stock market holidays   c  2017 elsevier inc  all rights reserved

 is institutional ownership related to corporate social responsibility  the nonlinear relation and its implication for stock return volatility this study examines the relation between corporate social responsibility  csr  and institutional investor ownership  and the impact of this relation on stock return volatility  we find that institutional ownership does not strictly increase or decrease in csr  rather  institutional ownership is a concave function of csr  this evidence suggests that institutional investors do not see csr as strictly value enhancing activities  institutional investors adjust their percentage of ownership when csr activities go beyond the perceived optimal level  employing the path analysis  we also examine the mediating effect of institutional ownership on the relation between csr and stock return volatility  we find that csr decreases stock return volatility at a decreasing rate through its effect on institutional ownership  our results remain robust under several different csr measures and estimation methods  
 is it better to be both nice and nasty  investigating the co occurrence of sales manager aggressiveness and caring empirical research has largely neglected to investigate the issue of sales manager s problem resolution styles in handling conflicts  building on the qualitative work of lee and cadogan  2009   we investigate how sales manager s problem resolution styles  as reflected in both caring and aggressive interpersonal interactions with their salespeople  impact important sales force outcomes  the results show that depending on the level of caring that manager exhibits during the problem resolution process  the curvilinear effects of aggressiveness on salespeople emotional exhaustion and sportsmanship are dramatically altered  our findings are interesting  and suggest that the almost wholly negative picture painted in current academic literature regarding aggressive managerial style is at least somewhat simplistic  and perhaps rather overstated  therefore aggressiveness and caring further should be considered together  rather than separately

 is multi ethnic advertising a globally viable strategy for a western luxury car brand  a mixed method cross cultural study while multi ethnic advertising is increasingly used by non luxury brands  global luxury brands still almost exclusively use caucasian models in their global brand communication  we suggest that this is due to inconsistency in meaning and valence of multi ethnic advertising across and within countries  in qualitative interviews with 145 young consumers in japan  china  austria  and canada  recent japanese and chinese immigrants  and caucasian canadians  we find that multi ethnic advertising stands for  brand globalness  in ethnically homogeneous markets  but for  brand inclusiveness  in ethnically diverse markets  in line with optimal distinctiveness theory  ethnic majority consumers in japan and china prefer all caucasian advertising over multi ethnic advertising for a western luxury car brand  while recent japanese and chinese immigrants to canada show a relatively stronger appreciation for multi ethnic advertising  a quantitative study among 370 chinese consumers in china and recent chinese immigrants to canada confirms these patterns and the mediating role of need for differentiation

 it s the base  why displaying anger instead of sadness might increase leaders  perceived power but worsen their leadership outcomes although research has shown that anger displays lead to more perceived power than sadness displays  sadness displays often result in more positive leadership outcomes than anger displays  aiming to explain this discrepancy  we examine the specific power bases that are inferred from leaders  anger versus sadness displays as potential explanatory mechanisms  we conducted three experimental studies  replicating results with students and working adults and with different induction methods  our results indicate that the discrepancy between the effects of anger and sadness displays on power ascriptions and leadership outcomes can be explained by divergent power bases ascribed to angry versus sad leaders  whereas more position  i e   legitimate  reward and coercive  power was ascribed to angry leaders than to sad leaders  sad leaders were viewed as possessing more personal  i e   referent  power than angry leaders  moreover  while angry leaders  higher legitimate power was positively related to leaders  perceived effectiveness and follower loyalty  both enhanced coercive and reduced referent power were negatively related to these outcomes and positively related to leader directed deviance  although previous literature suggests that displaying anger instead of sadness might be functional for leaders  power  our findings aim to make leaders aware of the specific types of power they gain in followers  eyes when displaying anger versus sadness  by examining the power bases ascribed to angry versus sad leaders  our study reconciles inconsistent findings and elucidates the foundation on which angry versus sad leaders  capacity to influence followers is built  
 it s too pretty to use  when and how enhanced product aesthetics discourage usage and lower consumption enjoyment marketers invest a lot of resources in product aesthetics and design  but does this strategy always lead to favorable consumer outcomes  while prior research suggests enhanced aesthetics should have a uniformly positive influence on pre usage evaluations and choice  the present research examines the downstream effects of nondurable product aesthetics on consumption behavior and post consumption affect  first  we document an inhibiting effect of aesthetics on actual consumption  we find that highly aesthetic products elicit greater perceptions of effort in their creation  and that consumers have an intrinsic appreciation for such effort  because the consumption process indirectly destroys the effort invested to make the product beautiful  people reduce consumption of such products because usage would entail destroying something they naturally appreciate  second  we show that in cases where individuals do consume a beautiful product  they exhibit lower consumption enjoyment and increased negative affect  these negative post consumption outcomes are mediated in parallel by concerns over having actually destroyed the effort that made the product beautiful as well as the decrements in beauty that become visible when aesthetic products are made less attractive through consumption  across a series of studies  we challenge the common assumption that enhanced aesthetics always lead to positive consumer outcomes

 joint audit  audit market structure  and consumer surplus we use a structural application of the discrete choice model to investigate how the introduction of a joint audit policy would affect audit market structure and consumer surplus  we perform this policy evaluation by identifying demand fundamentals in a joint audit regime and applying them to a single audit regime  we find that a joint audit requirement has the potential to change the audit market structure substantially but that the effects are sensitive to the specific policy design  for example  small audit firms gain market share in a joint audit regime but only if an equal sharing of the workload between the two joint auditors is not required  our counterfactual analysis reveals that the introduction of a joint audit regime would be associated with a substantial loss of consumer surplus  the loss results from restricting clients from giving all of the audit work to their most preferred audit firm  but it is partly offset by gains in consumer surplus deriving from the opportunity to choose the best combination of auditor pairs  
 just about money  ceo satisfaction and firm performance in small family firms this paper examines how family ownership and family ties influence the relative importance of economic and non economic goals on the ceo s satisfaction with the firm  using a sample of small high tech family and non family firms  we show that the influence of past firm economic performance on ceo satisfaction is weaker in the case of ceos leading a family firm  our results also suggest that this influence becomes weaker as the family firm transitions into subsequent generations  however  contrary to our expectations  we were not able to find a differential effect of firm performance on ceo satisfaction between ceos who belong to the controlling family and those who do not  
 knowledge dependence and the formation of director interlocks in this study  we examine knowledge dependence  a unique form of external dependence firms face when they pursue new technologies  our focus is on the formation of interorganizational ties as a means to manage the firm s knowledge dependence  studying the board interlock ties of 717 technology based firms in 2002 2006  we find that tie formation is more likely when an external counterpart is more closely aligned with the global trajectory of the focal firm s core technology and when the counterpart is more active in defending its intellectual property in this area  as a result of the interlock  the firm is more likely to gain access to the counterpart firm s knowledge resources through research and development alliances and forestall litigation barriers in the use of core technologies  our findings provide important theoretical implications for the unique role of knowledge resources in interorganizational dependence and tie formation  
 knowledge transfer in the context of buyer supplier relationship  an analysis of a supplier s customer portfolio in the context of buyer supplier relationship  the present study will not only analyse the role of formal and informal mechanisms to transfer knowledge but also the direct and moderating effect of trustworthiness  as relational dimensions  to understand how customers acquire knowledge from suppliers  the results related to a sample of 105 customers belonging to a medium sized italian manufacturer s customer portfolio show that both formal and informal transfer mechanisms positively impact knowledge acquisition  trustworthiness positively moderates the effect of informal transfer mechanisms and negatively moderates the effect of formal transfer mechanisms on knowledge transfer  some considerations regarding the customer portfolio are suggested to enhance our understanding of the effectiveness of knowledge transfer mechanisms in relation to different trustworthiness contexts  
 knowledge based human resource management practices  intellectual capital and innovation this paper proposes a conceptual model in which a human resource management  hrm  system of explicitly knowledge based hrm practices impacts a firm s intellectual capital  producing higher innovation performance  we have empirically tested this idea in a survey dataset of 180 spanish companies using structural equation modelling  sem  based on partial least squares  pls   the results show that intellectual capital positively mediates the relationship between knowledge based hrm practices and innovation performance and illustrate the pivotal role of human capital in this relationship  knowledge based hrm practices impact structural and relational capital partially through human capital  and human capital affects innovation performance by enhancing structural and relational capital  
 korea s growth driven trade policies  inclusive or exclusive  we attempted to find whether the korea s growth driven trade policies during the period of its industrialisation has contributed to output growth together with income distribution by qualitatively analysing the performance of trade policies interacting with the multilateral trading system over time  in addition  we conducted a regression analysis to investigate the effect of korea s trade growth on inclusive growth during its industrialisation period covering the period of 1976 2011  we found that the recent reform policies reported in the wto s trade policy review for korea in 2016 have attempted to achieve more balanced distribution of gains from trade but not enough to lead the korean economy to a well balanced welfare state  more specifically  we found the positive effects of international trade on inclusive growth driven by strong output growth effect  not by the effect on income distribution  even though income distribution measured by gini indices has been worsened after the east asian financial crisis  we could not find significant evidence that korea s rapid international trade growth has been responsible for the deteriorating income inequality  
 labor flexibility and innovation in new ventures the study investigates how labor flexibility affects innovation in new ventures  more specifically  drawing upon a sample of 143 greek ventures less than 8 years old  it examines empirically the individual and interactive effects of functional and numerical flexibility on product innovation  it also considers how these effects are moderated by the entrepreneur s political skill  results suggest that functional flexibility has a positive direct effect on incremental innovation  whereas numerical flexibility has a positive direct effect on radical innovation  the interactions between numerical and functional flexibility affect both types of innovation  the results also suggest that the labor flexibility innovation relationship is positively moderated by the entrepreneur s political skill  these findings point toward aspects of knowledge related with flexible labor engagement and entrepreneurial relational capital that affect innovation  
 labor force heterogeneity and asset prices  the importance of skilled labor previous studies have identified a negative relation between firms  hiring rates and future stock returns in the cross section  we document that this relation is significantly steeper in industries that rely relatively more on high skill workers than low skill workers  a long short portfolio sorted on firm level hiring rate earns an average annual return of 8 6  in high skill industries  and only 0 9  in low skill industries  moreover  this pattern is not explained by the standard capm  these findings are consistent with a neoclassical model with labor force heterogeneity and labor market frictions if it is more costly to replace high skill than low skill workers  
 language as a cultural vessel in online servicescapes  its impact on consumers  perceived risk  attitudes  and behavioural intentions globalisation and the broader use of the internet have led both academia and professionals to dedicate a great deal of attention to the analysis of the cultural differences that exist within a market and between different markets  language emerges as a relevant issue in current marketing and communication management environments  especially in online servicescape  following this premise  the current paper examines the role of language as a vessel of cultural values  namely  individualism and uncertainty avoidance  and its impact on consumer s perceived risk  attitudes  and behavioural intentions in online servicescape  to address this objective  an experimental design was performed  the sample comprised 491 internet users from 2 different national cultures  british and spanish   users were asked to browse an experimental website in their native or first language  whereas the other half of the sample browsed in their second language  british subjects browsing in spanish and vice versa   the unique contribution of this study lies in demonstrating that online information processing is moderated by the language by which users elaborate information and their cultural values in terms of the dimensions of individualism and uncertainty avoidance  the findings provide valuable insights into the role of language in international marketing strategies  as well as in multicultural and cross cultural integrated marketing communications  in this regard  marketers must acknowledge the symbolic cues of language and the competitive advantage that might derive from a strategic language choice to evoke emotions and forge attitudes that are consistent with brand and corporate values  
 languages and corporate savings behavior speakers of strong future time reference  ftr  languages  e g   english  are required to grammatically distinguish between future and present events  while speakers of weak ftr languages  e g   chinese  are not  we hypothesize that speaking about the future in the present tense may result in the belief that adverse credit events are more imminent  consistent with such a linguistic hypothesis  weak ftr language firms are found to have higher precautionary cash holdings  we report additional supportive results from changes in the relative importance of different languages in a country s business domain  evidence from within one country with several distinct languages  and results related to changes following a severe financial crisis  our evidence introduces a new explanation for heterogeneity in corporate savings behavior  provides insights about belief formation in firms  and adds to research on the effects of languages on economic outcomes   c  2017 published by elsevier b v  
 leadership  the being component  can the spiritual exercises of saint ignatius contribute to the debate on business education  in recent years  scholars have increasingly dedicated their attention to analyse and reflect on the topic of leadership  however  the debate has often focused on the figure of the leader  as if being a leader were a self sufficient function in itself  understood without finalities or independent of them  i would argue that leadership is not a position that can be assumed  but  rather  a relationship that is constructed  similarly  the question of leaders has often given rise to a deconstruction of its components  without any insight as to how the reality is put together  leadership cannot be understood solely from a technical or instrumental perspective  it is not a mere relational skill that simply requires developing competencies  the exercise of leadership always includes explicitly or implicitly a connection with values  therefore  developing leadership is impossible without a personal process that develops the person s capacity for perception  learning  interiorisation  explicit sense making and constructing meaning  these issues are truly important at a time in which the debate on business education and its contribution is completely open  targeting the very core of business education s reason for being  though open  the debate can only become a truly dynamic discussion if there is a real dialogue between the different positions and traditions  for this reason  this paper proposes an anthropological and non denominational reading of some of the fundamental meditations found in the spiritual exercises of saint ignatius which could be used as a heuristic in the debate regarding what business schools propose  this paper represents an initial step in this direction  exploring some of the potentialities of the spiritual exercises for business schools that do not claim any religious tradition  
 learning sustainability  absorptive capacities as drivers of sustainability in mncs  purchasing mncs are expected to operate in a sustainable fashion  implementation of sustainability requires the ability to acknowledge external  sustainability related  knowledge  and to apply it in intra company activities such as purchasing  we focus on absorptive capacities as potential drivers of sustainability  and investigate the effect that a purchasing function s capacity to absorb and process knowledge has on social and environmental sustainability practices  and subsequently on economic performance in purchasing  we compare mncs and nonmncs using a structural equation model of a large set of survey data from four european countries and find that only realized absorptive capacities impact sustainability practices in purchasing and this impact is smaller in mncs than in other companies  we suggest that companies respond to the demand for sustainability by strengthening their implementation capabilities  the potential to acquire and transform knowledge within a purchasing function is less relevant  and what matters is its application  
 learning to wait we use cai et al   2017  s proxy of patience and find out that investors do learn from their prior trading experiences  they become more patient when they participate in more ipos  and they tend to obtain higher returns  we also document a concave learning curve  inexperienced investors are overall less patient than more experienced ones  however  inexperienced investors  marginal effect of learning is higher than experienced ones  this learning effect only exists in infrequent traders   c  2017 elsevier inc  all rights reserved  
 lender entrepreneur relationships and credit risk  a global analysis of microfinance institutions prior research suggests that long term relationships with microfinance institutions  mfis  are necessary for sustained growth of microcredit initiated small businesses  however  we present robust evidence that long term lending relationships may worsen the credit risk of mfis  based on information on 1087 mfis from 69 countries over the period of 2003 2014  we show that  at the initial stage  credit risk declines as an mfi makes more relationship based loans  but after a certain level  default and delinquencies increase with the magnitude of relationships  we further show that the non linear  u shaped  association between relationship lending and credit risk is stronger  a  among small mfis compared to that among large mfis and  b  among mfis that make individual loans compared to those making joint liability based loans  we discuss policy implications of these findings

 leverage effect  volatility feedback  and self exciting market disruptions equity index volatility variation and its interaction with the index return can come from three distinct channels  first  index volatility increases with the market s aggregate financial leverage  second  positive shocks to systematic risk increase the cost of capital and reduce the valuation of future cash flows  generating a negative correlation between the index return and its volatility  regardless of financial leverage  finally  large negative market disruptions show self exciting behaviors  this article proposes a model that incorporates all three channels and examines their relative contribution to index option pricing and stock option pricing for different types of companies  
 liabilities and benefits  examining the two sides of the foreignness coin from entrepreneurial perspective this paper provides an in depth examination of foreignness at the individual level by studying it in the context of entrepreneurs  based on data collected from 470 domestic and foreign entrepreneurs operating in the u s   it was concluded that foreignness has a curvilinear relationship with entrepreneurial performance  there was also evidence of moderating effects of entrepreneurial orientation on the relationship between foreignness and performance  implications of the findings are discussed  
 liability of foreignness  natural disasters  and corporate philanthropy this study examines how philanthropy can mitigate liability of foreignness  lof  in the aftermath of a national disaster  a major disaster restructures the social landscape  creating an avenue for corporate contributions to play a role in recovery and relief efforts  this social restructuring offers a valuable opportunity for multinational enterprises  mnes  to establish strong local ties  in turn  mne contributions at such times have a stronger impact on their local acceptance  thus  mnes can use these events to strengthen their position in the community and mitigate lof  using the context of a national disaster in india  i test these arguments with a sample of 190 mnes and 660 domestic firms  i found that in the aftermath of the disaster  the increase in mne contributions was much larger and less strongly tied to promotional activities than the increase in contributions from domestic firms  and this difference persisted over time  moreover  the performance implication of post disaster philanthropy was stronger for mnes than for domestic firms  these findings suggest that philanthropy plays a more strategic role for mnes in the aftermath of a disaster and it has a pronounced effect on mitigating lof  
 life cycle stages and brazilian family business profiles the distinctive features of family firms  such as family influence  add complexity to organizational life cycle models in terms of the different stages of development  this research analyzes the relationship between stages of the organizational life cycle proposed by lester et al   2003  and the elements of influence of the f pec family  power  experience  and culture   the study was developed through a sample of 117 brazilian family companies  without the participation of companies with shares traded on the stock exchange  and employed statistical treatment of the data through a structural equation model  as a result  the elements of f pec were partially identified in the sample  power indicates the control of the company by the family  experience indicates the role of the different generations  and culture indicates the values of the controllers  in particular  it should be pointed out that  at birth  power and culture play important roles  in maturity  experience and culture stand out  and in rejuvenation  power and culture have been identified as characteristic  as an exploratory analysis  the article contributes to the understanding of organizations  by indicating the development of comparative analyses and performance on the variables that provide migration planning to more desirable stages  such as growth  maturity  and rejuvenation  
 life insurance demand under health shock risk this article studies the consumption investment insurance problem of a family  the wage earner faces the risk of a health shock  the family can buy long term life insurance that can only be revised at significant costs  a revision is only possible as long as the insured person is healthy  the combination of unspanned labor income and the stickiness of insurance decisions reduces the long term insurance demand significantly  since such a reduction is costly and families anticipate these potential costs  they buy less protection at all ages  in particular  young families stay away from long term life insurance markets altogether  
 likeability and its effect on outcomes of interpersonal interaction interpersonal interactions between boundary spanning individuals have a fundamental role in how inter organizational interactions develop  this study examines interpersonal interaction and the effects of likeability on two attributes that are central to many organizations  commodity prices as negotiation outcomes and a partner s willingness to engage in collaboration  specifically  we aim to answer  how does interpersonal like ability impact negotiation outcomes in terms of commodity prices and how does it affect a partner s willingness to engage in collaboration  based on social exchange theory we draw hypotheses that are tested using data gathered from experiments with 220 participants  the findings indicate that likeability significantly influences a partner s willingness to engage in collaboration but does not significantly influence negotiation profits  the implications of these findings for research and practice are discussed  
 limits of arbitrage and idiosyncratic volatility  evidence from china stock market this study examines how limits of arbitrage can affect the pricing of idiosyncratic volatility  using both unique trading constraints in the chinese stock market and other commonly used limits of arbitrage measures  we construct a comprehensive limits of arbitrage index  based on this index  we find that the negative idiosyncratic volatility return premium is much stronger and more persistent in stocks with high limits of arbitrage  furthermore  the existing explanations about the idiosyncratic volatility return premium cannot fully explain what we find about the role of limits of arbitrage in the pricing of idiosyncratic volatility in the chinese stock market  our study suggests that the trading constraints introduced in the name of protecting individual investors can actually hurt them  since these additional limits of arbitrage will increase the inefficiency of the security market   c  2015 elsevier b v  all rights reserved  
 linking alliance portfolios to recombinant innovation  the combined effects of diversity and alliance experience innovating firms establish alliance portfolios in hopes of creating recombinant innovation  an outcome of combining new ideas from diverse technological domains  we draw on research in alliances  social networks  and knowledge spillovers to identify the configuration of alliance portfolio that links to recombinant innovation  our longitudinal analysis of firms in the biotechnology industry shows that the technological diversity of a firm s alliance portfolio has a positive impact on the breadth of recombinant innovation produced by the firm  this relationship is strengthened in the presence of explorative alliance experience  rather than exploitative alliance experience  between the firm and its portfolio partners and among the portfolio partners  however  the positive influence of alliance experience in general diminishes when more than half of portfolio partners have prior ties with the firm  finally  our licensing revenue data show that the breadth of recombinant innovation is strongly related to the economic value of the innovation  our findings suggest that innovating firms need to manage the balancing act between sourcing for ideas from unfamiliar domains and leveraging alliance experience in configuring their alliances in aggregate  this study offers new insight into the composition and the collective experience of alliance portfolios  extending our understanding of alliance performance beyond the outcome of bilateral alliances   c  2016 elsevier ltd  all rights reserved  
 liquid consumption this article introduces a new dimension of consumption as liquid or solid  liquid consumption is defined as ephemeral  access based  and dematerialized  while solid consumption is defined as enduring  ownership based  and material  liquid and solid consumption are conceptualized as existing on a spectrum  with four conditions leading to consumption being liquid  solid  or a combination of the two  relevance to the self  the nature of social relationships  accessibility to mobility networks  and type of precarity experienced  liquid consumption is needed to explain behavior within digital contexts  in access based consumption  and in conditions of global mobility  it highlights a consumption orientation around values of flexibility  adaptability  fluidity  lightness  detachment  and speed  implications of liquid consumption are discussed for the domains of attachment and appropriation  the importance of use value  materialism  brand relationships and communities  identity  prosumption and the prosumer  and big data  quantification of the self  and surveillance  lastly  managing the challenges of liquid consumption and its effect on consumer welfare are explored  
 liquidity and the implied cost of equity capital we investigate the impact of liquidity level and risks on the implied cost of equity capital for 14 808 stocks from 52 countries  we find that the implied cost of equity increases in the illiquidity level and in the co variance between firm level illiquidity and market illiquidity  but decreases both in the covariance between firm level returns and market illiquidity and in the co variance between firm level illiquidity and market returns  specifically  an increase from the 25th to the 75th percentile of the aggregate liquidity risk factor increases the cost of equity by 109 basis points  the evidence we report is robust to wide range of tests  we also observe that liquidity level and risks impact the implied cost of equity during crisis and no crisis periods  but this relation is more pronounced during crisis periods for the most illiquid stocks   c  2017 elsevier b v  all rights reserved  
 liquidity risk and volatility risk in credit spread models  a unified approach we present an integrated framework incorporating both exogenous liquidity risk in the secondary corporate bond market and volatility risk in the dynamics of asset value in debt rollover models  using an innovative theoretical approach we derive general expressions for the debt and equity values in all cases  taking advantage of the analytical expressions for the asset value with the constant elasticity of variance  cev  process  we show numerically using realistic parameter values from empirical studies that volatility risk  together with deteriorating bond market liquidity  decreases both debt and equity values and significantly increases the credit spreads  
 liquidity shock management  lessons from australian banks prior to the 2007 2009 financial crisis  international banks had an average share of around 65  of the syndicated loan market in australia  when the crisis hit  the resulting liquidity shock resulted in globally active international banks exiting the australian market  with limited global operations  the major australian banks were able to absorb and manage the liquidity shock  this resulted in domestic banks carrying a significantly greater proportion of revolving credit facilities in their syndicated loan portfolios after 2008  domestic bank willingness and ability to deal with the market disruption and to hold a greater proportion of high liquidity risk revolvers are directly linked to the level of their transaction deposits  their increased involvement in revolving facilities cannot be fully explained by the certification effect or flight to home effect  it is not demand driven and is robust to endogeneity tests  
 little fish in a big pond  legitimacy transfer  authenticity  and factors of peripheral firm entry and growth in the market center research summary  how do peripheral firms compete and secure future growth  building on literature in strategy and organizational theory  we test a model of peripheral entry and growth in the mainstream market segment  using data from 289 craft breweries over 11 years  we find evidence that niche producers are increasingly entering the mainstream market and competing with market center firms  we identify two mechanisms contributing to these actions  legitimacy transfer and cognitive claims of authenticity  as hypothesized  imitation of niche products by macro breweries facilitates craft beer entry into mainstream markets  moreover  two authenticity based identity codes are found to reliably influence craft brewery growth  a local identity  i e   operating in one s local market  and a product proliferator identity  i e   offering a more diverse set of products  managerial summary  how can small niche firms compete with larger  more established organizations  by examining the rapidly expanding craft beer industry  this study explores how craft breweries are able to both enter the market space of these larger competitors and secure sustained patterns of growth  specifically  we highlight two factors influencing the success of craft breweries  first  as major beer producers mimic niche products  i e   faux craft beer   smaller niche firms are allowed to enter the market by exposing the typical consumer to the tastes of craft beer  second  craft breweries enjoy increased success if they  a  emphasize the local elements of their company  and or  b  offer a larger number of products  copyright  c  2017 john wiley   sons  ltd  
 loan sales and bank liquidity management  evidence from a us credit register we examine how banks use loan sales to manage liquidity during periods of marketwide stress and the associated spillovers to market prices  we track the dynamics of loan share ownership in the secondary market using data from a u s  supervisory register of syndicated loans  controlling for loan quality using loan year fixed effects  we find that banks reliant on wholesale funding were more likely to exit syndicates through sales during 2007 08  this effect is stronger for banks dependent on short term funding and holding fewer liquid securities  in addition  secondary market prices decrease significantly more for loans funded by liquidity strained banks  
 long vs  short term asymmetry in volatility and the term structure of risk this short paper introduces the distinction between short and long term asymmetric effects in volatilities  with short term asymmetry we refer to the conventional one  i e  the asymmetric response of current volatility to the most recent return shocks  in addition  we argue that there may be asymmetries with respect to the way the effect of past return shocks propagate over time  we refer to this as long term asymmetry and propose a model that enables the study of the potential occurrence of such a feature  in an empirical application using stock market index data we find evidence of the joint presence of short and long term asymmetric effects and demonstrate important implications for risk predictions  in particular  positive return shocks is ascribed substantial significance for long term risk prediction   c  2017 elsevier inc  all rights reserved  
 long term versus short term contingencies in asset allocation we investigate whether long term and short term components of typical conditioning variables in asset pricing studies  such as the dividend yield or yield spread  have different implications for optimal asset allocation  we argue that short term components relate mostly to momentum  and long term components relate mostly to mean reversion effects  respectively  therefore  they may have a different information content for investors with different horizons  we obtain improvements in terms of out of sample sharpe ratios and expected utilities for decomposed state variables that directly reflect information related to the stock market  such as the dividend yield and stock market trend  
 love at first sight  the effect of presentation order on evaluation of experiential options in luxury tour packages this study examined how serial order and information format jointly determine consumers  preferences of tour packages  the results showed that the option viewed first in a sequence was preferred  vs  not preferred  when the information format facilitated  vs  inhibited  narrative processing  preference shifts to the first viewed option due to narrative processing was prominent among consumers with defensive attitudes to self threats and in circumstances where the first option was challenged by an attractive alternative  three experiments were conducted and showed that narrative processing enhanced attachments to the first option if consumers simulated the experience  which in turn motivated them to be consistent in subsequent evaluations  managerially  these findings suggest that in addition to emphasizing the importance of occupying the first position in a series of advertisements and products  marketers should also facilitate experience simulations rather than focusing solely on the attributes of luxury tours  
 macro level spillovers and micro level capabilities as antecedents of young smes  propensity to export and to become a born global after reviewing literature on knowledge based antecedents of the internationalization of smes  one could conclude that knowledge based capabilities of the firm and external spillovers are influential factors equally valid for leading a firm to decide becoming an exporter or becoming a born global  since these decisions are conceptually different  and so are those potentially influential factors  one at the micro and the other at the macro level of antecedents  this research work assumes the opposite thesis  for hypotheses testing  we examined the case of young spanish manufacturing smes combining firm level data with territorial data at the autonomous community level in spain  applying binomial logistic regression models  which estimate the probability of an event happening  results from a sample of 242 young spanish manufacturing smes corroborate that knowledge spillovers rather than firm s capabilities influence a young sme s propensity to export  while firm s capabilities rather than knowledge spillovers influence a new venture propensity to become a born global firm

 macroeconomic announcements and price discovery in the foreign exchange market this study shows that the dominance of the overlapping trading hours of london and new york in the price discovery of the eur usd and usd jpy markets only applies on days with u s  announcements  different from cai et al   2008  and wang and yang  2011   we highlight the informational advantage of local traders at the arrival of macroeconomic announcements in the local market  and find that macroeconomic announcements affect the pattern of price discovery across different markets  consistent with chen and gau  2010  and jiang et al   2012   we also examine changes in information shares before and after the announcement  a significant increase in price discovery before the announcement suggests the possibility of information leakage  while enhanced price discovery efficacy after the announcement suggests that prices gradually adjust to new information  not just immediately respond to the arrival of announcements   c  2017 elsevier ltd  all rights reserved  
 macroeconomic risk and seasonality in momentum profits we contribute to the growing debate on the relation between macroeconomic risk and stock price momentum  not only is momentum seasonal  so is its net factor exposure  we show that winners and losers only differ in macroeconomic factor loadings in january  the one month when losers overwhelmingly outperform winners  in the remainder of the year  when momentum does exist  winner and loser factor loadings offset nearly completely  furthermore  the magnitude of macroeconomic risk premia appears to seasonally vary contra momentum  in contrast  the relatively new profitability factor does a much better job of capturing the described seasonality   c  2017 elsevier b v  all rights reserved

 making markets with the dead  residential burial among the yoruba the study examines how traditional meanings attributed to housing and the rituals relating to death and burials on private properties are being challenged due to modernisation  familial politics  and contending sets of interests  i e   valuing property for its economic capital vs  social cultural capital   the methodology approach is based on in depth interviews with 12 respondents from a diverse range of socio economic backgrounds  findings reveal how negotiations and renegotiations of interests affect the physical state and marketability of houses in the yoruba communities  the findings also sign post a fascinating entry point for exploring the way yoruba are negotiating and navigating the relationship between modernity and tradition  an important implication for marketing and consumption praxes concerns the dynamism in the narratives of ritual behaviour  especially in the non western tradition  the paper contributes to the navigation of relationships between the living and the dead within a nigerian subculture from a marketing perspective  
 male immorality  an evolutionary account of sex differences in unethical negotiation behavior past research has found that men negotiate more unethically than women  although many studies report comparable rates of unethical negotiation behaviors  based on evolutionary psychology  we predict conditions under which sex differences in unethical negotiation behavior are more versus less pronounced  we theorize that greater levels of unethical behavior among men occur because of greater male intrasexual competition for mates  this suggests that more male unethical negotiation behavior should primarily emerge in situations associated with intrasexual competition  using a two wave survey design  study 1 found a positive relationship between mating motivation and unethical negotiation behavior for male  but not female  employees  study 2 was a controlled experiment  replicating this effect and showing that the gender difference was most pronounced when negotiating with same sex  attractive opponents  study 3 used a similar experimental design and found support for another implication of evolutionary theory that mating motivation would prompt unethical behavior in both men and women when the behavior constitutes a less severe norm violation  we discuss contributions to the literature on unethical behavior at work  negotiations  and the role of attractiveness in organizations

 management innovation driving sustainable supply management process studies in exemplar mnes although research in the area of sustainable supply management  ssm  has evolved over the past few decades  knowledge about the processes of emergence and innovation of ssm practices within organizations is surprisingly limited  these innovation processes are  however  important because of the considerable impact they may have on resulting sustainable practices and because of ssm s complex societal and intra firm challenges  in a process study on management innovation  the sequences of ssm innovation processes in two exemplar case companies are studied to address   what are the sequences through which ssm emerges within exemplar organizations    and  in what way do management innovation processes influence resulting ssm practices    we build on literature regarding firstly management innovation and secondly communities and internal networks of practice  an ssm innovation model and propositions are developed  proposing how the process of management innovation affects ssm practices and firm performance in a broader perspective   c  2017 acede  published by elsevier espana  s l u  
 management teams  regulatory foci and organizational units  exploratory innovation  the mediating role of coordination mechanisms we further current understanding about the role of management teams in driving exploratory innovation by proposing that the regulatory focus of an organizational unit s management team is a key antecedent of the unit s level of exploratory innovation  and by clarifying the organizational coordination mechanisms through which this antecedent generates the unit s exploratory innovation  our results  based on a survey of 748 managers from 69 organizational units of a large multinational semiconductor company  indicate that the promotion focus of a unit s management team relates positively to the unit s exploratory innovation  in contrast  prevention focus has a marginal negative effect  these effects are mediated by the management team s use of decentralization and connectedness  our research advances theory development regarding the micro foundations of organizational innovation and increases our understanding of how the views of a unit s management team are reflected in the unit s level of exploratory innovation and therefore impact the unit s chances of survival   c  2016 elsevier ltd  all rights reserved  
 managerial ability and bank loan pricing this paper examines the impact of borrowers  managerial ability on lenders  bank loan pricing and the channels through which managerial ability affects bank loan pricing  using a large sample of us bank loans  we provide evidence that higher managerial ability is associated with lower bank loan prices  this effect is stronger in firms with high information risk  suggesting that an important channel for managerial ability to affect bank loan pricing is through improved financial disclosure to mitigate information asymmetry  the relationship is also stronger for firms with weak business fundamentals  implying that another channel is through improved business performance  of these two mechanisms  path analysis suggests that the business fundamentals mechanism is the more important channel through which managerial ability affects bank loan pricing  
 managing a company crisis through strategic corporate social responsibility  a practice based analysis a growing number of companies focus not just on generating economic value but on expanding their perspective  including social  human  and environmental aspects  historically  companies mainly included corporate social responsibility  csr  in their activities in economically promising times  but can csr be applied in economically difficult times  too  as a potential strategic mechanism to recover from a company crisis  this study aims to advance understanding of strategic csr and crisis recovery  and their possible relationship  the case study s findings suggest that strategic csr can have a positive impact on crisis recovery and promote the revision of established practices required to manage a company crisis  the findings have relevance to companies seeking to innovate in the csr space  to social entrepreneurs  and to researchers and practitioners interested in these topics  copyright  c  2017 john wiley   sons  ltd and erp environment 
 managing communication and cultural barriers in intercultural service encounters  strategies from both sides of the counter understanding how satisfaction can be guaranteed when participants arrive from different and diverse national cultures is of crucial importance  the objective of our study is to identify key factors that influence the participants involved in intercultural service encounters in their efforts to solve problems arising during encounters within a hotel context  as part of our study  we carried out in depth interviews with representatives from both the service provider and the customer  a comprehensive framework was constructed based on the analyses of the interviews with the help of constructivist grounded theory  in order to identify the factors that may prove to be significant in intercultural service encounters  findings of the study highlight the potential communication and cultural barriers faced by participants of the interaction when their efforts to solve problems  as they transpire  ultimately depends on their personal characteristics and experience as well as their knowledge of and openness to other cultures  managerial implications of this study suggest that flexibility of the service employees  behaviour and their adaptation to customer needs are an important part of training programs  but also need to include elements of intercultural sensitivity  an important implication for marketers is that they should reflect on the basic expectations of customers relating to the need for adaptation or the need for exploring the differences  while it is important to know and react properly to customers  expectations  it is just as important to manage them through communication tools  
 managing longevity risk by implementing sustainable full retirement age policies in this article  we investigate the effect of five policies to link the retirement age to  forecasted  survival probabilities  we investigate the effect of these policies on the distribution of the  future  full retirement age and on longevity risk in the discounted future payments  our investigated policies effectively hedge longevity risk  but do lead to substantial uncertainty in the retirement age and the expected number of years in retirement  we find that policies based on present values lead to a higher annuity factor than policies based on expected remaining years in retirement  our results can explain the differences between the proposed automatic rule to adjust the full retirement age in the united kingdom  defined contribution pension schemes  and the netherlands  defined benefit pension schemes   
 managing resource allocation  personal reflections from a managerial perspective the problem of resource allocation is central to economics  it is also central to the strategic management of companies  despite considerable research by management scholars describing the process in firms first carried out in the 1960s and continuing since then  management theory of the process remains wedded to a financial model of capital budgeting that poorly fits the problem facing companies  consulting firms stepped into the gap with models of business portfolios that helped frame the resource allocation choices among business units  but over time  changes in the capital markets  in the flows of technology  and in the patterns of global competition have meant that the dilemmas facing company managements are far more complex than the models and concepts academic researchers use to describe them  this may well be because the forces that must be taken into account are cognitive  organizational  and interpersonal as well as economic and thus cross the lines of academic disciplines  while the time horizon of these problems exceeds the scope of a typical academic research project  there is important research to be done  
 mapping out the sharing economy  a configurational approach to sharing business modeling sharing economy businesses have emerged in recent years as a disruptive approach to the traditional way of planning  modeling and doing business  the phenomenon has gained significant traction within a wide range of domains including entrepreneurship  innovation  technology and management more broadly  despite this surge and interest  there is a lack of empirical research regarding the increasing diversity of sharing economy business models and the implications for business growth  community impact  sustainability and public policy  with this research  we sought to leverage a rigorous comparative method  fs qca  to assess the business models of 36 firms in the sharing economy  leveraging a rich set of qualitative data  our analysis leveraged seven dimensions of sharing economy business models drawn from extant research  revealing a typology comprising five ideal types that collectively account for the constellation of possible  empirically relevant business models across the sharing economy  the emergent dilemmas and paradoxes as well as implications of these typologies of business models for startups  investors and policymakers are explored   c  2017 elsevier inc  all rights reserved

 market leadership  technological progress and relative performance in the mobile telecommunications industry in network industries a large installed customer base is considered a key strategic asset that leads to a sustainable competitive advantage  this paper argues that market leaders should be able to demonstrate relative performance advantages vis a vis their competitors  furthermore  we examine the moderating role of technological progress as a significant environmental factor that could alter the market leadership relative performance relationship  the two stage procedure proposed by simar and wilson  2007  is used to estimate relative performance determinants in the european mobile telecommunication industry  in the first stage  data envelopment analysis  dea  technique is used to measure performance  and in the second stage we empirically test our hypotheses by bootstrapping the dea estimates with a truncated regression  our results provide evidence that leaders enjoy performance advantages  the findings also reveal that the leader s relative performance is compromised in the event of technological progress  
 marketorientation  organizational performance  and the mediating role of crowdsourcing in knowledge based firms this paper establishes the relationships between market orientation and crowdsourcing in knowledge based firms for improving their organizational performance  by understanding the relationships among these variables  firms are in a better position to tackle complex business and innovation problems faster and at a lower cost  results from the spanish biotechnology and telecommunications sectors show the relevance of social networks for a better adaptation to rapidly changing markets and increasing competitiveness  
 marketplace commodification of risk communication  consequences for risk bearers and implications for public relations society s attempt to understand and communicate about risk is perhaps the world s oldest topic the rationale for human existence and survival  douglas  1992   this paper takes critical stock of public relations scholarship and practices in the daunting complex that has become known as the infrastructural approach to risk communication  this approach blends critical judgment of the community structures where risk is discussed and the discourse in which it is analyzed as the foundation for risk governance needed for fully functioning societies  the critical lens of hegemony and postmodernism reveals how an increasing amount of risk communication scholarship and practice has evolved into a new professional  industrial  and societal hegemony that often marginalizes risk bearers and risk arbiters as a nuisance in an otherwise modern and elitist approach to risk control through which risk communication becomes a  priced commodity   such commodification can empower organizations to take further risks because of the perceived confidence that its robust risk management programs and risk communication teams  including public relations  can control the dialogue and thereby help protect it from business continuity failure  the great challenge is whether risk communication and management ultimately favors the interests of elites over  and even to the marginalization and subjugation of  the interests of risk bearers and arbiters  ignoring the experiences of inequalities over the life span  
 masters of disasters  an empirical analysis of how societies benefit from corporate disaster aid corporations are increasingly influential within societies worldwide  while the relative capacity of national governments to meet large social needs has waned  consequentially  firms face social pressures to adopt responsibilities that have traditionally fallen to governments  aid agencies  and other types of organizations  there are questions  though  about whether this is beneficial for society  we study this in the context of disaster relief and recovery  in which companies account for a growing share of aid  as compared to traditional providers  drawing on the dynamic capabilities literature  we argue that firms are more able than other types of organizations to sense areas of need following a disaster  seize response opportunities  and reconfigure resources for fast  effective relief efforts  as such  we predict that  while traditional aid providers remain important for disaster recovery  relief will arrive faster and nations will recover more fully when locally active firms account for a larger share of disaster aid  we test our predictions with a proprietary data set comprising information on every natural disaster and reported aid donation worldwide from 2003 to 2013  using a novel  quasi experimental technique known as the  synthetic control method   our analysis shows that nations benefit greatly from corporate involvement when disaster strikes  
 matching response to competitors  moves under asymmetric market strength this paper investigates a firm s inclination to match a rival s strategic move under asymmetric market strength  drawing from the awareness motivation capability framework  we theorize that a firm is more likely to match modestly weaker competitors to sustain its current lead and match modestly stronger competitors to eschew lagging further behind  conversely  a firm is less likely to match far weaker competitors due to its lack of attention and match far stronger competitors due to its inability to compete  event history analysis of a set of it companies  entry moves into various locations in china exhibits support for our hypotheses  our findings suggest that a firm s matching response most often occurs under a moderate level of asymmetric market strength  
 materialism and the sharing economy  a cross cultural study of american and indian consumers the global rise of the sharing economy has attracted widespread attention among managers  marketers and researchers as non ownership modes of consumption are increasingly being adopted by consumers  building on previous research that distinguishes non ownership consumption programs  this article investigates the role of materialism in participation in sharing based programs of the sharing economy cross culturally  unlike previous research that stated that materialism is in contrast with sharing  this research shows that under certain circumstances  both in america and india  materialism will lead to greater participation in the sharing economy  however  the reason why is different for each culture  for americans  this effect is expected to surface for programs that resemble sharing as they don t compete with ownership of products but rather encourage materialist consumers to seek out transformative and hedonic experiences that are expected to improve their self image and well being  for indians  materialism will lead to participation in sharing based programs through increased perceived utility  managerial and theoretical implications are discussed  
 materialism pathways  the processes that create and perpetuate materialism materialism has been examined in many social science disciplines from multiple perspectives  this review synthesizes this extensive literature into two organizing frameworks that describe how materialism develops in children and how materialism is reinforced and perpetuated in adulthood  the major components of the developmental model are the daily event cycle  developmental tasks  cultural influence  and family environment  all of which interact to influence how materialistic a child becomes  the reinforcement model describes how personal qualities that materialists tend to possess make them more vulnerable to threats in daily events  resulting in psychological discomfort  the desire to reduce this discomfort  in conjunction with the transformative powers that materialists ascribe to acquisition  results in actions and outcomes that reinforce materialistic tendencies  suggestions for furthering the study of materialism are also included   c  2017 society for consumer psychology  published by elsevier inc  all rights reserved  
 maximizing  choice freedom  and duration judgments in choice making this paper examines  a  whether people are less accurate in judging choice time as choice tasks involve more choice options  more choice information  or a combination of both and  b  whether people with a higher tendency to look for the best option in choice making  maximizers  have less accurate duration judgments of choice time as compared to people who are more easily settling for a choice outcome that is satisfactory  satisficers   a multilevel analysis is used to explore the relationships of interest using data collected through a series of choice tasks  in general  the results suggest that people seem to misjudge time durations when making choices  moreover  empirical evidence demonstrates that people with an outspoken tendency to maximize in choice making do not differ significantly in estimating choice time accurately as compared to people who experience almost no need to maximize  
 me  my brand and i  consumer responses to luxury brand rejection integrating the social rejection and brand threat literatures  this research examines how consumers respond when the luxury brand they identify with is rejected by their social peers  across two studies  it is observed that  consumers who identify with a brand  a threat to the brand elicit defensive behavioral response whether it s stemming from an in group or an out group  however  consumers who dis identify with the brand only adopt defensive behaviour when the brand is rejected by an out group  high brand identifiers report higher need for belonging and negative affect following threat while brand dis identifiers are not affected  the findings further delineate consumer responses to luxury brand related rejection in reflexive and reflective stages of rejection  the study extends previous work on rejection and offers a number of managerial implications  
 mean and variance equation dynamics  time deformation  garch  and a robust analysis of the london housing market the potential relationship between time deformation and generalized autoregressive conditional heteroscedasticity  garch  is examined  despite time deformation and garch being mean and variance equation phenomena  respectively  they are argued herein to share a common motivation relating to the examination of changes in the temporal evolution of time series processes  via extensive simulation analysis  a close connection between the two concepts is established  it is found that the presence of garchcan result in the spurious detection of time deformation  particularly when examining the heavy tailed distributions and volatile data typically considered in empirical finance  it is shown that although the application of heteroskedasticity corrected covariance matrix estimators often increases  rather than corrects  the detected oversizing of the tests of time deformation  the application of garchfilters does provide a solution to size distortion  the findings of the experimental analysis are drawn upon to provide a robust empirical examination of the london housing market where evidence of overwhelming and widespread nonlinearity is detected in the form of time deformation  the implications of these findings for the conduct of future  and the interpretation of previous  research are discussed  
 meaningful mediation analysis  plausible causal inference and informative communication statistical mediation analysis has become the technique of choice in consumer research to make causal inferences about the influence of a treatment on an outcome via one or more mediators  this tutorial aims to strengthen two weak links that impede statistical mediation analysis from reaching its full potential  the first weak link is the path from mediator to outcome  which is a correlation  six conditions are described that this correlation needs to meet in order to make plausible causal inferences  directionality  reliability  unconfoundedness  distinctiveness  power  and mediation  recommendations are made to increase the plausibility of causal inferences based on statistical mediation analysis  sweetspot analysis is proposed to establish whether an observed mediator outcome correlation falls within the region of statistically meaningful correlations  the second weak link is the communication of mediation results  four components of informative communication of mediation analysis are described  effect decomposition  effect size  difference testing  and data sharing  recommendations are made to improve the communication of mediation analysis  a review of 166 recently published mediation analyses in the journal of consumer research  a reanalysis of two published datasets  and monte carlo simulations support the conclusions and recommendations  
 measuring firm size in empirical corporate finance in empirical corporate finance  firm size is commonly used as an important  fundamental firm characteristic  however  no research comprehensively assesses the sensitivity of empirical results in corporate finance to different measures of firm size  this paper fills this hole by providing empirical evidence for a  measurement effect  in the  size effect   in particular  we examine the influences of employing different proxies  total assets  total sales  and market capitalization  of firm size in 20 prominent areas in empirical corporate finance research  we highlight several empirical implications  first  in most areas of corporate finance the coefficients of firm size measures are robust in sign and statistical significance  second  the coefficients on regressors other than firm size often change sign and significance when different size measures are used  unfortunately  this suggests that some previous studies are not robust to different firm size proxies  third  the goodness of fit measured by r squared also varies with different size measures  suggesting that some measures are more relevant than others in different situations  fourth  different proxies capture different aspects of  firm size   and thus have different implications  therefore  the choice of size measures needs both theoretical and empirical justification  finally  our empirical assessment provides guidance to empirical corporate finance researchers who must use firm size measures in their work   c  2017 elsevier b v  all rights reserved  
 measuring tax sensitive institutional investor ownership we classify all institutional investors that file form 13 f over the period 1995 2013 as either  tax sensitive  or  tax insensitive  based on their trading behavior and portfolio characteristics  we examine tests of the effects of investor tax sensitivity on portfolio rebalancing  price pressure  and fund performance  and compare our measure of tax sensitive institutional investor ownership to three measures used in prior studies  we show that our measure of tax sensitive investors dominates other measures in the portfolio rebalancing and price pressure tests  in the fund performance test  our measure of tax sensitivity is the only one that finds that tax sensitive investors have significantly lower returns on their portfolio stocks  which is a new result in the literature

 middle managers  engagement in autonomous strategic actions  does it really matter how top managers use budgets  fostering middle managers  entrepreneurial behavior is a key concern for established firms  budgets are one of the most widely used management tools in organizations  and several conceptual articles claim that the way in which they are used  most notably in an interactive way  affects middle managers  autonomous strategic actions  asa   this type of entrepreneurial behavior in established firms focuses on opportunities outside the firms  currently served product market domains  using structural equation modeling and a formative measurement instrument for interactive use of budgets  we test these claims advanced in conceptual literature within a broad sample of large firms  we find that the way in which budgets are used does not significantly impact middle managers  engagement in asa  in contrast  firms  boundary systems and middle managers  autonomy seem important antecedents to asa  
 military entrepreneurs and the development of the french economy in the eighteenth century in the eighteenth century  a few military entrepreneurs with connections to the secretary of state of the navy developed large companies in order to meet the needs of the french state  which included a naval fleet fit to compete with its enemies  one of these entrepreneurs was babaud de la chaussade  while initially specialising in timber supply  his enterprise came to monopolise anchor manufacturing and owned one of the largest iron foundries in france  for over 30years  babaud s enterprise had a presence in all the naval and french east india company markets for iron products  the enterprise was bought by the french state at the end of the eighteenth century and survived until the end of the twentieth century  
 mindless resistance to persuasion  low self control fosters the use of resistance promoting heuristics in our consumer society  people are confronted on a daily basis with unsolicited persuasion attempts  the present research challenges the prevailing view that resisting persuasion is more likely to fail when consumers have low self control  four experiments tested the hypothesis that impaired self regulation may actually facilitate resistance to persuasion when the influence context contains resistance promoting heuristics  indeed  participants with low self control were less likely to comply with a persuasive request  experiments 1 and 3   reported a less favourable attitude towards an advertised product  experiment 2   and generated more negative responses towards a persuasive message  experiment 4  than participants with high self control  when they could rely on resistance promoting heuristics  a violation of the norm of reciprocity  experiments 1 and 3   an advertisement disclaimer  experiment 2   or negative social proof  experiment 4   together  these studies demonstrate that contextual cues can bolster resistance when one does not carefully scrutinize an influence attempt  
 minority owned banks and efficiency revisited u s  government support for minority owned banks  mobs  dates to the late 1960s  evidence through the early 1990s suggested these banks are relatively inefficient  this study updates that research  using stochastic frontier analysis  sfa  and panel data from 2003 to 2014 on minority owned banks and other banks  it is  as far as we know  the first such study to exclude outliers in sfa estimation  while recovering the outliers for efficiency estimation  initial results identify a disruption in cost efficiency during 2008  with statistically distinct regimes for 2003 2007 and 2009 2014  including recovered observations alters the patterns of mob efficiency in significant ways  and leads us to conclude that current mob inefficiency is mainly limited to asian american owned and multi racial and minority serving banks  tests for the effects of government deposits under a u s  treasury program suggest these did not adversely effect efficiency among covered mobs  but may have improved survival rates for those mobs subsequent to the financial collapse  
 mitigating information asymmetry through sustainability assurance  the role of accountants and levels of assurance this paper aims to examine the usefulness of sustainability reporting in reducing information asymmetry as result of lower dispersion and higher accuracy in financial analysts  earnings forecasts  the empirical results from an international sample of listed companies indicate that the disclosure of sustainability information alone is not sufficient in this regard as our findings indicate that information asymmetry is reduced to a greater when such information is assured  supporting the value relevance role of sustainability reporting and assurance  in addition  the empirical findings suggest differences in terms of assurance attributes  provider and level of engagement  and such differences are even more relevant when controlling the institutional context  assurance is highly appreciated by investors in more stakeholder oriented countries  however  in more shareholder oriented environments  assurance affects information asymmetries only when it is provided by accounting professionals who also report a  reasonable  opinion

 mne performance during a crisis  an evolutionary perspective on the role of dynamic managerial capabilities and industry context as the likelihood of worldwide crises increases due to globalization and the resulting economic contagion  understanding why some multinational enterprises  mnes  prevail in such environments becomes ever more critical  drawing from the concept of dynamic managerial capabilities  we posit that mne in crisis performance is associated with the pre crisis development of asset management capabilities  or the capacity of managers to orchestrate assets so as to extract more value from the firm s resource pool  specifically  we argue that because dynamic managerial capabilities evolve as a response to a firm s task environment  mnes that operate in dynamic industries develop stronger asset management capabilities  however  we also posit that whether these capabilities contribute to in crisis performance is contingent upon the munificence of the industry environment in which the capability evolves  asset management capabilities that evolve in munificent environments would encompass a wider spectrum of routine altering activities  and thus increase the ability of the mne to react to more revolutionary events  such as global economic crises  conversely  asset management capabilities that evolve in resource scarce environments will result in more strategic lock in due to firms  constrained ability to experiment with novel resource configurations  resulting in poorer in crisis performance  we test our hypotheses using a sample of 854 mnes in the context of the global financial crisis of 2008  and find support for our hypotheses  we discuss implications for the dynamic capabilities view and mne resilience  
 modeling the evolution of system technology performance when component and system technology performances interact  commensalism and amensalism the interaction between technologies critically determines technology evolution  commensalism and amensalism are two common relationships between component and system technologies but have attracted scant research attention  in both the relationships  the component technology performance is unaffected by the system technology performance  however  as the component technology performance improves  the system technology performance is enhanced in commensalism but inhibited in amensalism  we model commensalism and amensalism and predict the evolution of system technology performance using lotka volterra equations  in these two scenarios  we decouple the equations and derive the general analytic solution for system technology performance  we also deduce the corresponding solutions for cases where the component technology performance follows a logistic function or simple exponential growth  the solutions consider the impact on system technology performance of changes in component technology performance and enable us to predict the future performance evolution of system technology  we demonstrate the prediction accuracy of our model through an empirical study of the concrete skyscraper technology  we also interpret the parameters in lotka volterra equations and explore strategies to boost system technology performance  the analytic solutions and parameter interpretations allow practitioners and policy makers to use our model as a strategic management tool for their future work  
 modularity in roadmapping   integrated foresight of technologies  products  applications  markets and society  the case of  lithium ion battery lib 2015  this paper describes how modularity is implemented in a roadmapping framework so that from a set of stand alone roadmaps each could be used as an interconnected module  vertically and horizontally perfectly fitting together in an overall integrated roadmap describing a broad landscape of corresponding developments in technologies  products  applications  markets and society  the concept of modular roadmapping is illustrated by the example of a huge roadmapping project accompanying the innovation alliance  lithium ion batteries lib 2015   carried out by fraunhofer institute for systems and innovation research isi  karlsruhe  and funded by the federal ministry of education and research  bmbf   germany  the roadmapping framework addresses a broad technology landscape covering three focal domains   i  energy storage with lithium ion battery technologies in general  addressing all kinds of corresponding battery applications   ii  energy storage for electric mobility and  iii  stationary energy storage specifically  each domain is represented and specified through a certain technology roadmap covering technological developments  a product roadmap assessing corresponding market trends and product requirements  and an integrated  unified roadmap linking technology push and market pull in a broader integrated view  in order to further specific insights for next generations of batteries in the above mentioned roadmapping project  modularity for integrated roadmapping helps to systematically link expertise on technologies  products  applications  markets and society in regards to overarching  inter  national challenges  e g  the german energy transition   every roadmap forms an independent module for itself  showing different paths of future development and critical dependencies in each of the three highly dependent but also highly complex domains mentioned  yet only through the integration of all perspectives in technologies  products  applications  markets and society  the aim of analyzing and documenting changes of innovation systems as a whole can be accomplished  from an academic perspective  a modular design approach in roadmapping contributes to more conceptual clarity  especially when providing roadmaps for a technology driven innovation system with a core technology in the focus and multiple other competing or complementary technologies around  from a practitioner s point of view  guidance is provided on how to link developments and progression made in basic and applied science  industrial r d and socio political trends  for current and emerging technologies and applications  the experience made and insights from various stakeholders involved in this roadmapping project are of interest and relevance for all actors  be they from science  industry or policy  as they may trigger the development of existing and emergence of new industries   c  2016 elsevier inc  all rights reserved  
 momentum strategies in european equity markets  perspectives on the recent financial and european debt crises we investigate the profitability and return patterns of momentum strategies in 10 european countries  using data from december 2003 to december 2015  we find momentum returns to be lower than to those reported in previous research  our results indicate that the low momentum returns can be attributed to market conditions during the period of 2007 2012  when examining momentum returns generated by small and large stocks in separate time periods  we find momentum returns to be stronger among small stocks and weaker in large stocks   c  2017 elsevier inc  all rights reserved  
 monetary policy and macroprudential policy  rivals or teammates  this paper sheds some light on situations in which monetary and macroprudential policies may interact  and potentially get into conflict  and contributes to the discussion about the coordination of those policies  using data for the czech republic and five euro area countries we show that monetary tightening has a negative impact on the credit to gdp ratio and the non risk weighted bank capital ratio  i e  a positive impact on bank leverage   while these effects have strengthened considerably since mid 2011  this supports the view that accommodative monetary policy contributes to a build up of financial vulnerabilities  i e  it boosts the credit cycle  on the other hand  the effect of the higher bank capital ratio is associated with some degree of uncertainty  for these and other reasons  coordination of the two policies is necessary to avoid an undesirable policy mix preventing effective achievement of the main objectives in the two policy areas   c  2017 elsevier b v  all rights reserved  
 monetary policy uncertainty and the market reaction to macroeconomic news we examine whether monetary policy uncertainty influences the reaction of the equity  treasury security  foreign exchange and crude oil markets  as well as medium term interest rates  to u s  macroeconomic announcements  using intraday futures data  we show that in the presence of higher policy uncertainty the response to macroeconomic news weakens in the stock and crude oil markets and strengthens in the treasury  interest rate and foreign exchange markets  in times of elevated monetary policy uncertainty  macroeconomic announcements impact the financial and crude oil markets to a large extent through expectations of future monetary policy   c  2017 elsevier b v  all rights reserved

 mortgage payment problem development and recovery  a joint probability model approach the existing literature on mortgage default and foreclosure largely examines the development of mortgage problems  the first stage  and the possibility of recovery from such problems  the second stage  separately  such studies may provide an incomplete picture of the development and possible resolution of mortgage problems  this paper uses the proprietary geo coded version of the panel study of income dynamics from 2009 through 2013 to implement a different type of probability model  three transitional probability equations are estimated  the likelihood of homeowners developing mortgage payment problems  the likelihood that those who develop such problems move to resolve their problems  and the conditional probability that those who develop such problems and don t move will recover from them by other means  the coefficients from all three are combined to calculate the joint  state  probability of households having mortgage problems from which they will not recover  the analysis contains a number of unique results  changes in the mortgage front end ratio are shown to have a substantial influence on both developing a mortgage problem and its resolution for those who do not move  2  prior foreclosures are determined to affect the development of current mortgage problems  and 3  out of pocket medical expenses are found to influence both mortgage problem development and recovery  also  the impact of policy actions are considered across several at risk demographic groups  this experiment demonstrates that by improving the financial and mortgage characteristics  and the education level of households that actually develop mortgage problems  their predicted probability of developing mortgage problems that cannot be resolved could be reduced substantially  
 mortgage shoppers  how much do they save  survey evidence suggests that many u s  and european consumers do not spend a lot of time comparing mortgage products  we show  however  that mortgage shopping is associated with a substantial monetary payoff  using a unique data set from a website where borrowers  not the lenders  can post their complete set of received mortgage rate offers  a borrower who shops for five mortgage offers is able to save 7 078 euros in net present value on average  the potential savings suggest suboptimal mortgage shopping as the opportunity cost of time to renegotiate additional quotes is unlikely to be that high  
 mortgages and monetary policy mortgages are long term loans with nominal payments  consequently  in incomplete asset markets  monetary policy can affect housing investment and the economy through the cost of new mortgage borrowing and real payments on outstanding debt  these channels  distinct from the traditional real rate channel  are embedded in a general equilibrium model  the transmission mechanism is stronger under adjustable rate mortgages compared with fixed rate mortgages  further  persistent monetary policy shocks affecting the level of the nominal yield curve have larger real effects compared with transitory shocks  persistently higher inflation gradually benefits homeowners under frms  but hurts them immediately under arms  
 motivational cues and angel investing  interactions among enthusiasm  preparedness  and commitment angel investors often make investment decisions based on motivational cues communicated during pitches including enthusiasm  preparedness  and commitment to evaluate potentially important qualities of entrepreneurs  we tested the independent and interaction effects of these cues by having 72 angels complete 1 995 evaluations of 133 live pitches  we found a positive effect of preparedness on angel evaluations  an effect enhanced by one form of commitment  the relationship between enthusiasm and evaluations of funding potential varies depending on the type of commitment considered  our findings suggest that enthusiasm  preparedness  and commitment should be treated as conceptually and empirically distinct  
 motives and performance outcomes of sustainable supply chain management practices  a multi theoretical perspective many researchers believe the tremendous industrial development over the past two centuries is unsustainable because it has led to unintended ecological deterioration  despite the ever growing attention sustainable supply chain management  sscm  has received  most sscm research and models look at the consequences  rather than the antecedents or motives of such responsible practices  the few studies that explore corporate motives have remained largely qualitative  and large scale empirical analyses are scarce  drawing on multiple theories and combining supply chain and business ethics literature  we purport that instrumental  relational  and moral motives are behind a firm s engagement in sscm practices  specifically  we examine the links between corporate motives  sscm practices  and firm performance  using a sample of 259 supply chain firms in germany  we empirically test five hypothesized relationships  our results reveal that relational and moral motives are key drivers  and that firms exhibiting high levels of moral obligations tend to outperform those primarily driven by amoral considerations  findings of this study contribute to multiple literatures espousing sustainability management and can help policy makers  stakeholder groups  and scholars develop more robust strategies for encouraging firms to practice sscm  
 moving beyond socioemotional wealth  toward a normative theory of decision making in family business business owning families are widely believed to make decisions in order to increase their authority over  influence on  and identity with their businesses  yet  because the resulting socioemotional wealth is intended to be enjoyed by the family alone  this view reflects a largely self interested approach to decision making  we  therefore  call on family business scholars to leverage the work of social economists  i e   amitai etzioni  and moral philosophers  i e   adam smith  in order to develop normative guidance for family owners seeking to pursue their own interests as well as those of the other stakeholders in society to which they are accountable  
 multicriteria green supplier segmentation supplier segmentation is an important strategic activity for companies  the main purpose of segmenting suppliers is to more easily manage a large number of suppliers by formulating relationship management strategies for subsets of suppliers  which is more efficient than separate unique strategies for each supplier  existing supplier segmentation approaches have paid limited attention to environmentally related criteria  given the increased importance of sustainable and green supply chains  this points a large gap in the literature  thus  a green supplier segmentation model is proposed in this study  a supplier potential matrix is used to evaluate suppliers with respect to two dimensions  capabilities and willingness  with respect to environmental issues  given the multicriteria nature of this problem  a novel hybrid multicriteria methodology is used to evaluate the problem  rough set theory is used to calculate the weight of each criterion for suppliers  capabilities and suppliers  willingness  vlsekriterijumska optimizacija i kompromisno resenje  vikor  is then used to determine an overall score for each supplier  finally  fuzzy c means is used to segment the suppliers while considering the overall score for each supplier  an application of the proposed model for suppliers of a large chemical company is used to evaluate the feasibility of this technique  
 multimarket contact and rivalry over knowledge based resources research summary  research shows that multimarket contact  mmc  reduces rivalry involving downstream activities  yet  studies showing that mmc can increase the threat of imitation suggest a need to better understand how mmc affects upstream rivalry over knowledge based resources  in this study  we argue that mmc increases rivalry over knowledge based resources since the deterrent threat of retaliation that typically leads to mutual forbearance in downstream activities will not be sufficient to restrain firms from protecting their knowledge from imitation in upstream activities  in support of these arguments we find that mmc increases the likelihood that a firm initiates patent litigation against a rival  this study suggests the relationship between mmc and rivalry may depend on the competitive domain and the type of resources over which firms are competing managerial summary  how does market overlap or mmc affect rivalry between two competitors  prior studies have largely found that an increase in market overlap decreases rivalry in less knowledge intensive context because of the deterrent threat of retaliation  however  in this paper  we argue that an increase in market overlap may not reduce rivalry in more knowledge intensive context because of heterogeneity in capabilities to protect knowledge  we find that a firm is more likely to initiate patent litigation against a rival as market overlap increases  our findings suggest that the incentive to protect value across multiple product markets may surpass the motivation to cooperate with rivals and that managers should have a more nuanced view of how market overlap with competitors affects rivalry in more knowledge intensive contexts  copyright  c  2017 john wiley   sons  ltd  
 multinational corporations  strategies at the base of the pyramid  an action research inquiry why and how does a multinational corporation adapt its strategy and organizational capabilities to address markets at the base of the pyramid  bop   this paper builds on the results of a 3 year action research program conducted with lafarge  a global building materials company  during which it started to consider the bop segment as a strategic business opportunity  the article shows how pilot projects and global action networks created as part of the action research in the indonesian subsidiary and the firm s head office contributed to this change  the paper then discusses the implications of bop strategies in terms of organizational capabilities  
 multinationality and firm value  the role of real options awareness we contribute to multinationality and real options theories by considering the role of firm heterogeneity in real options awareness for mncs  we test the joint impact of real options awareness  ro awn  and multinationality on firm value using an extensive sample of u s  listed international firms over the ten year period 1996 2005  we show that when a firm s growth options and degree of ro awn are considered  multinationality has a significant positive impact on firm value and performance as measured by tobin s q return on assets and the 3 year average stock returns  we find that the benefits of multinationality accrue asymmetrically to firms differing in ro awn  managers who are more aware of their corporate real options are able to significantly enhance firm value  our findings are robust to a range of dataset and measurement specifications  endogeneity issues and controlling for alternative theories of the firm   c  2017 elsevier b v  all rights reserved  
 multiple dimensions of power influencing knowledge integration in supply chains this study investigates how multiple dimensions of power each facilitate knowledge integration within innovation projects in supply chains and their interrelationships  adopting a process perspective of knowledge  we offer an alternative to much of the existing debate  which has focussed on the possession of resources  we collected data from four case study original equipment manufacturers and six associated suppliers and analysed these using template analysis and cross case analysis  our findings reveal how the power of the system  operationalized through relative performance measures  performance measurement mechanisms and the individuals in charge of them  provides a facilitative context within which other dimensions of power operate  here  the power of resources  expert and legitimate power   processes  associated with raising issues  cross functional teams  early supplier involvement and reviews  and meaning  creating legitimacy through reviews  interact to support knowledge integration within innovation projects in supply chains  this  we argue  emphasises the plurality of power dimensions deployed and importance of their interrelationships in facilitating knowledge integration within hierarchical supply chain networks  
 music in advertising and consumer identity  the search for heideggerian authenticity this study discusses netnographic findings involving 472 youtube postings categorized to identify themes regarding consumers  experience of music in advertisements  key themes relate to musical taste  musical indexicality  musical repetition and musical authenticity  postings reveal how music conveys individual taste and is linked to personal memories and heidegger s coincidental time where moments of authenticity may be triggered in a melee of emotions  memories and projections  identity protection is enabled as consumers frequently resist advertisers  attempts to use musical repetition to impose normative identity  critiques of repetition in the music produce heideggerian anxiety leading to critically reflective resistance  similarly  where advertising devalues the authenticity of iconic pieces of music  consumers often resist such authenticity transgressions as a threat to their own identity  the heideggerian search for meaning in life emphasizes the significance of philosophically driven ideological authenticity in consumers  responses to music in advertisements  
 mutual fund skill in timing market volatility and liquidity we investigate both market volatility timing and market liquidity timing for the first time among uk mutual funds  we find strong evidence that a small percentage of funds time market volatility successfully  that is  when conditional market volatility is higher than normal  systematic risk levels are lower  the evidence around market liquidity timing ability is similar although it is slightly less prevalent compared to volatility timing  here  funds lower the fund market beta in anticipation of reduced market liquidity  we also find a positive relation between liquidity timing ability and fund abnormal performance where skilled liquidity timers outperform unskilled timers by around 3  p a though this finding is driven by poor liquidity timing funds going on to yield negative alpha  however  despite the evidence of volatility and liquidity timing ability among funds  we fail to find in support of persistence in this timing  we find little evidence supporting market return timing ability  
 myopic market pricing and managerial myopia this paper develops a firm level measure of myopic market pricing  which captures the extent to which the market overvalues short term expected abnormal earnings relative to longer term ones  the empirical analysis shows that myopically priced firms manage earnings more actively and invest less in r d  the impact of myopic market pricing is concentrated in firms where managers cater more to market pricing  that is  in firms with greater short term investor ownership  with ceo compensation that is more sensitive to the firm share price  and with higher equity dependence  additional tests show that these findings are robust to the consideration of market  under overpricing  the results suggest that when managers cater to market pricing  market myopia encourages managerial myopia  
 national power distance  status incongruence  and ceo dismissal using a large database of public companies from 22 countries  we examine the independent and interactive effects of national power distance and status incongruence on the likelihood of ceo dismissal  status incongruence exists in a top management team when there is an inconsistency of social status and hierarchical status among top management team members  we find that whereas national power distance decreases the likelihood of ceo dismissal  status incongruence has a positive effect on ceo dismissal  furthermore  the positive effect of status incongruence is more salient in high power distance societies

 no rest for the wicked  the epidemic life cycle of wicked consumer behavior wicked consumption behavior  namely the inflated consumption of unhealthy commodities such as tobacco and soft drinks  constitutes a leading risk for noncommunicable diseases including cancer and diabetes  despite the fatal impact of wicked consumption on societal welfare  both the social marketing literature and the public policy literature lack a systematic framework capturing the unfolding of the wicked consumption cycle and providing guidance on when and how to intervene upstream  drawing on historical data on tobacco and soft drink consumption in the u s   we propose a four stage epidemic life cycle of wicked consumer behavior  the biological and habitual factors that make different types of wicked consumption appealing to consumers are reinforced by the marketing activities of the manufacturers  to overcome the strong resistance posed by habitual wicked consumption  we articulate a typology of upstream intervention parameters and provide guidance on when and how to intervene depending on the desired long term equilibrium  
 non customers as initiators of radical innovation customers who initiate innovation is a topic frequently discussed in the marketing literature  however  the literature largely ignores non customers   individuals or firms not using products in the category as potential initiators of innovation in general and of radical innovation in particular  we argue that non customers have high knowledge of their own needs  but their knowledge of technology is insufficient to self generate an innovation  by approaching a potential supplier with a high knowledge of technology but an insufficient knowledge of the need  a unique dyad is created  characterized by a bilateral knowledge gap that stimulates increased learning and co creation of a potentially radical innovation  we use an historical approach to examine the technological and social antecedents and consequences of three innovations initiated by non customers  air conditioning  the pill  and the jeep  we contend that non customers can initiate innovations that may potentially change industries  create new markets  and have long term social and economic effects  
 nonlinear effects of social connections and interactions on individual goal attainment and spending  evidences from online gaming markets although it seems intuitive for firms to leverage social connections and interactions to influence consumers  goal attainment and spending  the authors present a caveat of such strategies  using two large scale data sets with more than 5 million people day observations from online gaming markets  studies 1 and 2 show consistently nonlinear effects  although some social connections and interactions boost goal attainment and spending  positive linear term   after a certain point too many of them have a diminished marginal effect  negative squared term   the results are robust to a wide array of modeling techniques addressing self selection  unobserved individual heterogeneity  and endogeneity  in addition  novices can benefit more from greater social connections and interactions  yet also suffer more from the diminishing effects  regarding the underlying mechanism  the follow up experiment study 3 shows that consistent with the information processing theory  some social connections and interactions can provide information support for goal attainment  but too many of them can introduce an information overload problem and  thus  hamper goal attainment intention  together  these findings refute a simple  linear view of the effects of social connections and interactions and provide pivotal theoretical and practical implications  
 nonverbal cues of deception in audiovisual crisis communication crisis communication research has mainly focused on verbal response strategies  such as apologies and denial  however  organizations and individuals in crisis often respond in an audiovisual manner  e g   press conferences  corporate videos   audiovisual messages convey not only verbal but also nonverbal cues  e g   gaze aversion  speech errors   these nonverbal cues can affect the public s perception of deception  and thus  the perception of the speaker s credibility  through a content analysis of 160 audiovisual crisis responses  this study examines which nonverbal cues of deception are communicated by organizations and individuals in crisis and how situational factors  e g   crisis type  affect the occurrence of these nonverbal cues  the findings show that several nonverbal cues of deception occur in audiovisual crisis communication and that their occurrence depends on the crisis type  the source  and the crisis communication format  
 nothing special about banks  competition and bank lending in britain  1885 1925 we investigate the impact of increasing bank concentration on bank loan contracts in a lightly regulated environment that allows us to abstract from possible confounding effects of regulation and focus on the  pure  effects of competition on bank lending  we study over 30 000 british bank loans over the period 1885 to 1925  borrowers in counties with high bank concentration received smaller loans and posted more collateral than borrowers in other counties  in high concentration counties  the quality of loan applicants improved  suggesting that banks restricted credit  not that the quality of loan applicants had worsened  
 offensive patent portfolio races in a patent portfolio race  firms attempt to assemble a large collection of patents  traditional explanations for patent portfolio races rest on an assumption of fragmented patent ownership where multiple unknown firms employ defensive strategies to forestall holdup  however  patent portfolio races can be observed when patent ownership is concentrated to the hands of a few firms  to explore patent portfolio races under conditions of concentrated ownership we turn to the newspaper printing machine industry  an industry characterized by a few dominant firms  using multiple sources patent analysis  archival data  and interviews we identify antecedents to a phenomenon we label offensive patent portfolio races  contrary to received wisdom  we find that patent portfolio races can be offensive  aimed at gaining rather than avoiding loss of competitive advantage  offensive patent portfolio races hinge on the breakdown of cooperation triggered by changes in the perceived benefits  effectiveness  and or costs of patents  partly mediated by the adoption of a gain frame towards increased patenting  and regulated by the potential loses from further increases  we explain the behavior by invoking the folk theorem in game theory and conclude that while triggering offensive patent portfolio races may yield temporary advantages  managers are advised to tread carefully as offensive patent portfolio races may have severe implications for the effectiveness and efficiency of the innovation process   c  2016 elsevier ltd  all rights reserved  
 offshoring pollution while offshoring production  research summary  we examine the role of firm strategy in the global effort to combat pollution  we find that u s  plants release less toxic emissions when their parent firm imports more from low wage countries  lwcs   consistent with the pollution haven hypothesis  goods imported by u s  firms from lwcs are in more pollution intensive industries  u s  plants shift production to less pollution intensive industries  produce less waste  and spend less on pollution abatement when their parent imports more from lwcs  the negative impact of lwc imports on emissions is stronger for u s  plants located in counties with greater institutional pressure for environmental performance  but weaker for more capable u s  plants and firms  these results highlight the role of local institutions and firm capability in explaining firms  offshoring and environmental strategies  managerial summary  using confidential trade  production  and pollution data of more than 8 000 firms and 18 000 plants from the u s  census bureau for years 1992 2009  we find that u s  plants release less toxic emissions when their parent firm imports more from low wage countries  lwcs   in addition  goods imported by u s  firms from lwcs are in more pollution intensive industries  u s  plants shift production to less pollution intensive industries  produce less waste  and spend less on pollution abatement when their parent imports more from lwcs  however  not all u s  firms choose to offshore pollution  u s  plants located in counties with greater institutional pressure for environmental performance offshore more  but more capable u s  plants and firms offshore less  copyright  c  2017 john wiley   sons  ltd  
 oil and stock markets before and after financial crises  a local gaussian correlation approach the effect of financial shocks on the cross market linkages between oil prices  spot and futures  and stock markets is examined for four major crises  we employ the local gaussian correlation approach and find that the two markets were regionalized for most of the 1990s and the early 2000s  flights from stocks to oil occur in all crisis episodes  except the recent global financial crisis  the view that stock and oil markets behave like a market of one after the financialization of commodities is further supported by the presence of contagion between us stock markets and all the benchmark oil markets  
 on equity risk prediction and tail spillovers this paper studies the impact of modelling time varying variances of stock returns in terms of risk measurement and extreme risk spillover  using a general class of regime dependent models  we find that volatility can be disaggregated into distinct components  a persistent stable process with low sensitivity to shocks and a high volatility process capturing rather short lived rare events  out of sample forecasts show that  once regime shifts are accounted for  accuracy is improved compared to the standard generalized autoregressive conditional heteroscedasticity or the historical volatility model  volatility plays an important role in controlling and monitoring financial risks  therefore  by means of a risk management application  we illustrate the economic value and the practical implications of risk control ability of the models in terms of value at risk  finally  tests for predictability in co movements in the tails of stock index returns suggest that large losses are strongly correlated  supporting asymmetric transmission processes for financial contagion in the left tail of return distributions  whereas contagion in reverse direction  gains  is weak  
 on the climate policy implications of substitutability and flexibility in the economy  an in depth integrated assessment model diagnostic this paper conducts an in depth model diagnostic exercise for two parameters  1  the elasticity of substitution between the capital labour aggregate and the energy aggregate in the integrated assessment model  iam  merge s production function and 2  the rate at which new technologies can be deployed within the energy system  we show that in a more complementary world the model s ability to adjust the carbon intensity of its energy sector is more important whereas in a more substitutable world the ability to expand carbon free technologies is of lesser relative importance  the uncertainty in the literature surrounding the elasticity of substitution parameter  its interaction with the mechanisms of technical change  and the associated danger of grounding forward looking analyses in historically based parameters lend support to the importance of such a diagnostic exercise  building on work from model inter comparison studies  we investigate whether a given model s choice of strategy is primarily a function of the choice of its parameter values or its structure  a deeper understanding of what drives model behaviour is beneficial to both modellers and the policymakers who utilise their insights and output  
 on the optimality of bank competition policy this study examines whether the effect of market structure on financial stability is persistent  subject to current regulation and supervision policies  the methodology of sala i martin  1997  is employed over a sample of 2450 banks operating within the eu 27 during the period 2003 2010  the results show a potential trade off between market power and soundness  and how possible it is to regulate this trade off above 21  markups  financial stability appears more pronounced in markets of less concentration  where policies lean towards limited restrictions on non interest income  official intervention in bank management and book transparency  regulation and competition can act as substitute or complementary policies vis a vis a more stable financial system with less competition distortions  
 on the origins of risk taking in financial markets financial investment behavior is highly correlated between parents and their children  using swedish data  we find that the decision of adoptees to hold equities is associated with the behavior of both biological and adoptive parents  implying a role for both genetic and environmental influences  however  we find that nurture has a stronger influence on the share of financial assets invested in equities and on portfolio volatility  suggesting that financial risk taking is substantially environmentally determined  the parental investment variables substantially increase the explanatory power of cross sectional regressions and so may play an important role in understanding cross sectional heterogeneity in investment behavior  
 on the relation between liquidity and the futures cash basis  evidence from a natural experiment as a response to the 2015 chinese stock market crash  regulators prohibited arbitrage activities in the index futures and cash markets  we use this natural experiment to test the hypothesis that liquidity and pricing efficiency causally affect each other  we find that resulting shift in the arbitrage boundary led to the breakdown of the two way causality relation between liquidity and the absolute futures cash basis  we thus confirm that the relation between liquidity and the absolute futures cash basis is not driven by the omitted variable bias  but is indeed due to arbitrage   c  2016 elsevier b v  all rights reserved  
 on the relative performance of investment grade corporate bonds with differing maturities we find that short maturity investment grade corporate bonds perform better  controlling for risk differences  than similar bonds with longer maturities  our results are at least partially attributable to insurance companies  trading behavior and align with the preferred habitat theory of the term structure  we find that insurance company purchases create a strong demand for long term bonds and that their rebalancing activity results in sales of short term bonds  as documented by extant literature  such demand supply imbalance is not easily resolved by arbitrageurs or firms seeking to time the market with bond issuance  
 on the robust and stable flowshop scheduling under stochastic and dynamic disruptions in this paper  we consider a permutation flowshop scheduling problem with the total flow time as the schedule performance measure  a proactive reactive approach is designed to simultaneously deal with stochastic disruptions  e g   machine breakdowns  and dynamic events  e g   newly arriving jobs and delay in job availability   in the proactive stage  the stochastic machine breakdown is hedged against the construction of a robust and stable baseline schedule  this schedule is either optimized by incorporating uncertainty into two surrogate measures or obtained by simulation  robustness is measured by the expected schedule performance  while stability is measured by the aggregation of dissatisfactions of manager  shopfloor operator  and customers using the prospect theory  in the reactive stage  we assume that the stochastic and dynamic disruptions concurrently occur  unlike the simple right shifting method  a more effective rescheduling approach is proposed to balance the realized schedule performance with stability  a common issue in these two stages is the conflict between objectives  thus  we propose a hybridization strategy that successfully enhances the classic non dominated sorting genetic algorithm  nsga ii and the hybridized algorithm outperforms nsga ii  multiobjective evolutionary algorithm based on decomposition  and multiobjective memetic algorithms designed for deterministic scheduling problems  finally  extensive computational studies on the taillard flowshop benchmark instances are conducted to illustrate the effectiveness of the proposed proactive reactive approach and the algorithm hybridization strategy  
 on the stock market reactions to fiscal policies in this paper  a panel analysis is employed to investigate the effects of fiscal policies on stock market indexes in 11 members of the eurozone  many studies have focused on the effects of monetary policy on the stock market  whereas the number of contributions studying the effects of fiscal policy on the stock market is surprisingly limited  therefore  we know little  if any  on the sign and stability of the stock market reaction to fiscal policies  our results show that fiscal policies influence the stock market and that  following an increase  decrease  in public deficit  stock market indexes go down  up   nevertheless  further analysis shows that the signs of the estimated stock market reactions are not constant over time and that they change according to the surrounding macroeconomic scenario  
 on the transaction cost of bitcoin using a unique data on bitcoin quotes in 16 different currencies  this paper examines the empirical transaction costs of bitcoin in international transactions  we find that the transaction cost of bitcoin is lower than that of retail foreign exchange markets  bitcoin markets have  on average  2  narrower bid ask spreads than retail foreign exchange markets and  when the u s  dollar is converted to other currencies via bitcoin  the resulting exchange rates are  on average  5  better than the retail foreign exchange rate  we find that bitcoin s simpler infrastructure is a source of the cost advantage   c  2017 elsevier inc  all rights reserved  
 online brand community practices and the construction of brand legitimacy contemporary marketers build online brand communities to communicate with the organization s social surroundings  yet there is a lack of understanding of how brand legitimization unfolds in these platforms  to understand how legitimacy is constructed and contested every day  the current study adopts a practice theoretical lens and discourse analysis to investigate two online communities  the contribution of the study is twofold  first  the insights from the discursive praxis  online community posts  comments and reactions illustrate the connections between multiple levels of legitimization discourse  second  this study builds a theoretical framework for legitimization practice  individual perceptions  judgements of the texts and actions on them in the online community intertwine with the organizational and societal context shaping the legitimacy of the brand in the community and beyond  this practice supports or challenges the brand as an institution and may legitimize or delegitimize the brand  
 online customer initiated contacts and the development of profitable relationships recent advances in technology have profoundly impacted the way firms interact and transact with current and prospective customers  the emergence of online channels has been of particular relevance  as it promotes consumers  active participation in the value creation process  in this study  we draw from the stimulus organism response model to provide a theoretical understanding of the role played by two critical factors driving online customer initiated contacts  oncics   social effects and perceived risk  additionally  we establish a direct link between these interactions and customer profitability  we merge longitudinal objective data with subjective data for a sample of 1990 customers in financial services and apply partial least squares  revealing that social effects influence perceived risk  perceived risk consequently promotes the development of oncics  while social effects reduce the need for such interactions  finally  oncics help to promote high quality relationships and leads to higher performance  implications for theory and management are discussed   c  2017 elsevier b v  all rights reserved  
 online shopping and social media  friends or foes  as social network use continues to increase  an important question for marketers is whether consumers  online shopping activities are related to their use of social networks and  if so  what the nature of this relationship is  on the one hand  spending time on social networks could facilitate social discovery  meaning that consumers  discover  or  stumble upon  products through their connections with others  moreover  cumulative social network use could expose consumers to new shopping related information  possibly with greater marginal value than the incremental time spent on a shopping website  this process may therefore be associated with increased shopping activity  on the other hand  social network use could be a substitute for other online activities  including shopping  to test the relationship between social network use and online shopping  the authors leverage a unique consumer panel data set that tracks people s browsing of shopping and social network websites and their online purchasing activities over one year  the authors find that greater cumulative usage of social networking sites is positively associated with shopping activity  however  they also find a short term negative relationship  such that immediately after a period of increased usage of social networking sites  online shopping activity appears to be lower  
 openness disposition  readiness characteristics that influence participant benefits from scenario planning as strategic conversation in this paper we examine the impact of participant readiness to engage with  perform and benefit from scenario planning processes  central to our examination is the concept of  openness disposition   which in the context of scenario planning refers to the tendency to seek either to hold open ambiguity  complexity and uncertainty  or look for closure  simplification and surety when engaging in strategic conversations  readiness indicates the capacity of individuals and collectives to work with competing narratives  dilemmas  tensions and differences of opinion  as may occur in scenario work  a focus on readiness through openness disposition enables critical evaluation of the utility of scenario planning to different individuals and groups based on their capacity to engage with equivocality during structured  exploratory strategic conversations  based on findings emerging from a longitudinal field study with prorail b v  holland  we empirically identify three characteristics of participant readiness  which are theorised to extend understanding of how individuals and groups might engage in  cope and benefit from  scenario planning processes   c  2016 elsevier inc  all rights reserved  
 openwashing  a decoupling perspective on organizational transparency with the rise of digital technologies  organizations are able to produce  process  and transfer large amounts of information at marginal cost  in recent years  these technological developments together with other macro phenomena like globalization and rising distrust of institutions has led to unprecedented public expectations regarding organizational transparency  in this study i explore the ways in which organizations resolve the tension between a growing norm to share internal information with the public and their inherent preferences for informational control  through developing the notion of transparency decoupling  i examine how organizations respond strategically to transparency expectations  drawing on studies of  open data  transparency initiatives in nyc  london  and berlin  i inductively carve out three modes of institutional information decoupling   a  selecting the disclosed information to exclude parts of the data or parts of the audience   b  bending the information in order to retain some control over its representative value   c  orchestrating new information for a particular audience  the article integrates literature from new institutional theory and transparency studies in order to contribute to our understanding of how information sharing is realized in the interaction between organizations and their environment   c  2017 elsevier inc  all rights reserved  
 opportunity discovery and creation in social entrepreneurship  an exploratory study in mexico building on the literature on opportunity identification among commercial entrepreneurs  we propose a conceptual framework for the opportunity identification process in social entrepreneurship that includes both opportunity discovery and opportunity creation  we develop scales to measure these constructs and examine their validity and reliability  in addition  we develop and test hypotheses explaining the causes of opportunity discovery and opportunity creation  our results confirm that opportunity discovery and opportunity creation are mutually exclusive constructs  we also find support for the role of radical innovation and information search in the opportunity identification process in a sample of mexican social entrepreneurs   c  2017 elsevier inc  all rights reserved  
 optimal enterprise risk management and decision making with shared and dependent risks dynamic enterprise risk management  erm  entails holistic decision making for critical corporate functions such as capital budgeting and risk management  the interplay across business divisions  however  is complicated due to their natural interactions through risk exposures that are shared and dependent across an intricate corporate structure  this article develops an integrated optimization framework via a copula based decision tree interface to facilitate erm decision making to meet the specified enterprise goal in a multiperiod setting  we illustrate our model and provide managerial insights with a case study for a financial services company engaged in both banking and insurance businesses  
 orchestrating the flow of human resources  insights from spanish soccer clubs although prior research recognizes the strategic importance of changes to the organization s human resource base  there is little consensus regarding the influence of human resource flows on organizational performance  employing a resource orchestration perspective  we emphasize the need by managers to orchestrate multiple  interrelated human resource flows  the role of the incumbent or newly appointed orchestrator in the decisions and outcomes associated with human resource flow strategies  and the importance of the performance of the current human resource base with which the flows interact  utilizing fuzzy set qualitative comparative analysis and longitudinal data from the spanish premier soccer league  we identify five ways in which organizations are able to effectively configure human resource flows  we then elaborate theory on managerial decisions that allow human resource flows to work together depending upon the particular organizational conditions  our study contributes to a better understanding of the performance outcomes of managerial resource flow decisions

 organizationally intractable decision problems and the intellectual virtues of heuristics there is no theory in strategic management and other related fields for identifying decision problems that cannot be solved by organizations using rational analytical technologies of the type typically taught in mba programs  furthermore  some and perhaps many scholars in strategic management believe that the alternative of heuristics or rules of thumb is little more than crude guesses for decision making when compared to rational analytical technologies  this is reflected in a paucity of research in strategic management on heuristics  i propose a theory of organizational intractability based roughly on the metaphor provided by computational intractability in computer science  i demonstrate organizational intractability for a common model of the joint strategic planning and resource allocation decision problem  this raises the possibility that heuristics are necessary for deciding many important decisions that are intractable for organizations  this possibility parallels the extensive use of heuristics in artificial intelligence for computationally intractable problems  where heuristics are often the most powerful approach possible  some important managerial heuristics are documented from both the finance and strategic management literatures  based on all of this  i discuss some directions for theory of and research on organizational intractability and heuristics in strategic management

 overcoming institutional voids  a reputation based view of long run survival research summary  emerging markets are characterized by underdeveloped institutions and frequent environmental shifts  yet  they also contain many firms that have survived over generations  how are firms in weak institutional environments able to persist over time  motivated by 69 interviews with leaders of emerging market firms with histories spanning generations  we combine induction and deduction to propose reputation as a meta resource that allows firms to activate their conventional resources  we conceptualize reputation as consisting of prominence  perceived quality  and resilience  and develop a process model that illustrates the mechanisms that allow reputation to facilitate survival in ways that persist over time  building on research in strategy and business history  we thus shed light on an underappreciated strategic construct  reputation  in an undertheorized setting  emerging markets  over an unusual period  the historical long run   managerial summary why are some firms able to persistently survive in challenging  uncertain  and underdeveloped business environments  to explore this question  we analyze in depth interviews with leaders of emerging market firms that have survived over decades and even centuries  we find that firm reputation is a key strategic driver  and propose new ideas about the ways through which reputation facilitates survival  we elaborate how a favorable reputation allows a firm to more fully utilize its existing resources by decreasing uncertainty  we also propose that reputation has offensive and defensive properties that make it valuable to firms during both positive and negative economic cycles  finally  we discuss why a reputation based source of competitive advantage is hard to imitate  and outline three general approaches for building reputation  copyright  c  2017 john wiley   sons  ltd  
 overcoming the  window dressing  effect  mitigating the negative effects of inherent skepticism towards corporate social responsibility as more and more instances of corporate hypocrisy become public  consumers have developed an inherent general skepticism towards firms  corporate social responsibility  csr  claims  as csr skepticism bears heavily on consumers  attitudes and behavior  this paper draws from construal level theory to identify how it can be pre emptively abated  we posit that this general skepticism towards csr leads people to adopt a low level construal mindset when processing csr information  across four studies  we show that matching this low level mindset with concrete csr messaging works to effectively mitigate the negative effects of inherent csr skepticism on consumers  attitudes  purchase intentions  and word of mouth  the resulting construal mindset congruency strengthens the favorability of consumer responses through increased positive elaboration and perceptions of csr message credibility  furthermore  this congruency effect is shown to persist over time in skeptical domains but to dissipate in less skeptical domains  
 ownership structure and internationalization of indian firms we examine the longitudinal relationship between ownership structure and firm internationalization  in a sample of indian firms  drawing on principal principal  pp  agency theory and the resource based view  rbv  of the firm  we argue that divergent preferences  motivations  of a firm s owners affect the firm s propensity to internationalize  while resource heterogeneity among these owners  owners  capability to access and provide resources  affects the firm s capability to internationalize we argue that both motivation and capability are required for firms to pursue internationalization and that when either of these is missing in an owner  that owner s shareholding will be negatively associated with internationalization  additionally  our results uncover an interesting dichotomy  while family owners with lower levels of ownership favor their firms  internationalization  they do not favor it at higher levels of ownership  our results indicate that foreign owners appeared to adjust their roles to accommodate the preferences of the dominant family owners  
 package color saturation and food healthfulness perceptions vivid  highly saturated colors are often perceived as exciting and arousing  making them popular in branding and package design  however  are foods packaged in vivid colors also perceived as unhealthful  across four experiments  we demonstrate that consumers appear to perceive foods in vivid  highly color saturated food packaging as less healthful than foods in muted  less color saturated packaging  further  we demonstrate that conceptual fluency mediates the effect  subjective nutrition knowledge weakens the effect  and restrained eating behavior strengthens the effect  we contribute to the color literature that explores the distinct effects of different color elements on consumer perceptions  we also advance the food well being literature by identifying a new heuristic that affects food well being  and in doing so  join other researchers who have connected learned color associations to substantive consumer outcomes  finally  we offer food marketers new insights into consumers  evaluations of their products  
 parameter estimation risk in asset pricing and risk management  a bayesian approach parameter estimation risk is non trivial in both asset pricing and risk management  we adopt a bayesian estimation paradigm supported by the markov chain monte carlo inferential techniques to incorporate parameter estimation risk in financial modelling  in option pricing activities  we find that the merton s jump diffusion  mjd  model outperforms the black scholes  bs  model both in sample and out of sample  in addition  the construction of bayesian posterior option price distributions under the two well known models offers a robust view to the influence of parameter estimation risk on option prices as well as other quantities of interest in finance such as probabilities of default  we derive a var type parameter estimation risk measure for option pricing and we show that parameter estimation risk can bring significant impact to greeks  hedging activities  regarding the computation of default probabilities  we find that the impact of parameter estimation risk increases with gearing level  and could alter important risk management decisions   c  2017 elsevier inc  all rights reserved

 parents  performance in entrepreneurship as a  double edged sword  for the intergenerational transmission of entrepreneurship we investigate how perceived parents  performance in entrepreneurship  ppe  affects the entrepreneurial career intentions of offspring  we argue that while perceived ppe enhances offspring s perceived entrepreneurial desirability and feasibility because of exposure mechanisms  it inhibits the translation of both desirability and feasibility perceptions into entrepreneurial career intentions due to upward social comparison mechanisms  thus  perceived ppe acts as a double edged sword for the intergenerational transmission of entrepreneurship  our predictions are tested and confirmed on a sample of 21 895 individuals from 33 countries  this study advances the literature on intergenerational transmission of entrepreneurship by providing a foundation for understanding the social psychological conditions necessary for such transmission to occur

 paths to respectability  consumption and stigma management in the contemporary black middle class when confronted with racial stigma  how do people manage it  what specific arrangements of objects and tactics do they mobilize to make everyday life more tolerable  if not more equal   the politics of respectability  respectability  is one such arrangement  respectability makes life more tolerable by offering a counternarrative that disavows stigma through status oriented displays  this strategy of action emerged alongside mass consumer culture in the late 19th century  but what relevance does it have to those who are stigmatized in contemporary consumer culture  based on ethnographic interviews and observations with middle class african americans  respectability remains an important strategy that has undergone profound changes since its origins while still operating in similar ways  in the late 20th century it fractured into two related but distinct counternarratives   1   discern and avoid   which seeks distance from whatever is stigmatized  and  2   destigmatize   using black culture as a source of high status  perceptions of how well either counternarrative manages stigma depend on how ideology  strategy  and consumption are connected via specific sociohistorical features of place and individual power resources  i illustrate those connections through four cases that show perceived success and perceived failure for each counternarrative

 persistent voting decisions in shareholder meetings this study examined the determinants of voting decisions in shareholder meetings  with a special focus on voting persistence  the data captured votes on managerial proposals in shareholder meetings held by u s  banks between 2003 and 2013  the dynamic panel data were analyzed using robust two step system generalized method of moments estimation  gmm  with orthogonal deviations  the lagged voting decision was a significant factor in explaining subsequent voting decisions  this finding provides evidence of voting persistence  although persistence is a prominent topic in behavioral economics  studies have tended to focus on buying  consumption  and investment decisions  persistence in voting decisions at the corporate level has been underexplored  so this article contributes to the behavioral economics literature  
 personality homogeneity in organizations and occupations  considering similarity sources the purpose of this study was to investigate organizational and occupational homogeneity  compare homogeneity at different levels of composition  and uncover a mechanism for homogeneity  data were obtained from an archival data base of current employees  n   23 933  in 40 organizations  19 major job groupings  42 minor job groupings  and 115 detailed job titles  support for homogeneity within organizations and occupations was found  regardless of the granularity with which occupation were defined  homogeneity estimates were smaller than prior estimates in the literature based on smaller  less diverse samples  occupational homogeneity was significantly greater than homogeneity at the organizational level for neuroticism and extraversion  as a potential mechanism  we demonstrated that occupational interest could predict personality at the occupational level  investigating homogeneity effects with a large  representative sample and simultaneously considering occupation and organization helps to advance our theoretical understanding of the attraction selection attrition process  this study provides evidence of relative homogeneity effects and mechanisms  such knowledge could help inform the selection  training  and socialization tactics employed by practitioners  little is currently known about how within occupation homogeneity in personality relates to within organization homogeneity  or the influence of vocational interests on such homogeneity  we provide a methodological update to decompose and compare organizational and occupational influence on personality homogeneity  we also assess homogeneity at three levels of occupational granularity  and delineate a mechanism for personality to become homogeneous at the occupation level  
 persuasion in crowdfunding  an elaboration likelihood model of crowdfunding performance this study draws upon the elaboration likelihood model of persuasion  elm  to develop and test a model of persuasive influence in crowdfunding  to test our hypothesized relationships  we drew upon a sample of 383 ventures taken directly from kickstarter  coupled with a decision experiment conducted in a simulated crowdfunding context  results suggest that issue relevant information  such as entrepreneurs  education  matters most when funders possess greater ability and motivation to make careful evaluations  in contrast  cues  such as adopting a group identity  have their strongest influence among inexperienced  first time funders  and when requested funding amounts are smaller  
 pesticide use and health outcomes  evidence from agricultural water pollution in china by linking provincial pesticide usage reports from several chinese statistical yearbooks  1998 2011  with the chinese longitudinal healthy longevity survey  1998 2011   this study provides new evidence that pesticides adversely affect health outcomes via drinking water exposure  we follow a difference in difference in differences framework to compare health outcomes between people who drink surface water and ground water in regions with different intensities of rice pesticide use before and after 2004  when china shifted from taxing agriculture to subsidizing agricultural programs  the results indicate that a 10  increase in rice pesticide use unfavorably alters a key medical disability index  activities of daily living or adl  by 1  for rural residents 65 and older  this is equivalent to 2 13 and 0 64 million dollars in medical and family care costs  respectively  further  we provide suggestive evidence of an intergenerational transfer of caring burden by showing pesticide use reduces out migration of the offspring in affected households  the results are robust to a variety of robustness checks and falsification tests   c  2017 elsevier inc  all rights reserved  
 physical proximity increases persuasive effectiveness through visual imagery six experiments converged on the conclusion that consumers  physical distance from the verbal description of an event or a product can influence their beliefs in its implications  for example  participants  proximity to information about the likelihood of surviving an airline crash can influence their expectations that there would be survivors of a real life airplane accident  and being close to the description of a commercial product can influence beliefs that the product would be effective  these and other effects are mediated by the vividness of the mental image that participants form on the basis of the information  consequently  the effects were attenuated when participants are under high cognitive load or when the verbal description lacks the detail necessary for forming a clear mental image  alternative interpretations in terms of task involvement  perceptual fluency and construal levels are evaluated   c  2017 society for consumer psychology  published by elsevier inc  all rights reserved

 popular research topics in marketing journals  1995 2014 during the past two decades  the focus of marketing has moved from the tactics of persuasion to the strategies of value cocreation  after moving toward cognitive science and corporate strategies in the early 2000s  marketing research returned to its traditional domains of consumer psychologies and customer management  while conscientious consumers are gradually restraining themselves from selfish indulgence  marketers have refocused on a new set of values that encompass mental  experiential  and societal well being  in this regard  we adopt an unprecedented approach by incorporating topic modeling with social network analysis  the results show that  in terms of topic heterogeneity  the most impactful journals are the most diverse  whereas each runner up has a unique focus  among the joumals  we detect two major co authorship communities  and among the topics  we detect three  further  we find that the communities of the most cited papers are composed of heterogeneous clusters of similar topics  the pivots within  and the bridges between  these communities are also reported  in the spirit of collaborative research  our topic model and network analysis are shared via online collaboration and visualization platforms that readers can use to explore our models interactively and to download the dataset for further studies   c  2017 direct marketing educational foundation  inc  dba marketing edge  all rights reserved

 potential measures for the pre detection of terrorism events worldwide make clear that the threat of terrorism is growing  and would be terrorists may be developing new strategies and new tools that will enable them to develop massively destructive weapons  yet  at the same time  new measures are becoming available that could improve chances for early identification of planned terrorist acts  a previous study conducted by the authors of this paper suggested that pre detection is feasible and in many cases  likely to be effective  these hints led to the present study and a subsequent nato workshop  3  intended to evaluate and extend a list of possible pre detection measures and their downside risks  the present paper presents and assesses results of a real time delphi  rtd  study that was conducted to collect judgments from an expert panel on the potential effectiveness  likelihood of use and other attributes of 19 pre detection measures derived from the literature and most importantly  their possible societal consequences  the results show that pre detection is possible especially if some pre detection measures are applied in parallel  while many attacks can be avoided  it is unlikely that 100  protection will ever be achieved  thus  intelligence gathering remains important and essential and resiliency and preparedness will always be necessary  the study further sheds light on possible collateral damage that could result from the inappropriate application of pre detection measures  principally compromise or loss of civil rights  unless we are careful in implementing these and other such measures  we could lose what we are trying to protect  
 potential surprise theory as a theoretical foundation for scenario planning despite some recent progress  scenario planning s development as an academic discipline remains constrained by the perception it is solely a practical tool for thinking about the future  with limited theoretical foundations  the paper addresses this issue by showing that g  l  s  shackle s  potential surprise theory   pst  contains much that can lend theoretical support to scenario planning   especially its use of plausibility rather than probability  and its focus on potential extreme outcomes  moreover  pst and scenario planning share the same ontology  viewing the future as constructed by the imagination of individuals  yet  under pst  while the future is imagined and  therefore  subjective  individuals nevertheless seek to identify the  best  option through a deductive process of elimination  pst therefore assists in overcoming the divide between the constructivist and deductivist perspectives in scenario planning as it employs both  finally  the paper shows that theoretically underpinning scenario planning with pst would place it at the heart of contemporary debates on decision making under uncertainty taking place in economics and other fields  enhancing its status and profile as a discipline   c  2016 the author  published by elsevier inc

 predicting the consequences of marketing policy changes  a new data enrichment method with competitive reactions this article introduces a new data enrichment method that combines revealed data on consumer demand and competitive reactions with stated data on competitive reactions to yet to be enacted  unprecedentedmarketing policy changes  the authors extend the data enrichment literature to include stated competitive reactions  collected from subject matter experts through a conjoint experiment  the authors apply theirmethod to investigate hypothetical and unprecedented sales force policy changes of pharmaceutical companies  the results from the data enrichment method have high face validity and lead to various unique insights compared with using revealed data only  the authors find that only a very large sales force decrease initiated by the market leader triggers all competitors to decrease their sales force as well  leading to substantial profit increases for each firm  with respect to sales force allocation  when competitors decrease their sales force  they mainly decrease the reach of detailing across doctors  rather than decreasing the number of details to the most visited doctors  the proposed data enrichment method provides managers with a powerful tool to  ex ante  predict the consequences of unprecedented marketing policy changes  
 predictors of entrepreneurial activity before and during the european economic crisis the aim of this study is to analyze the role of individual characteristics and social norms as variables that explain early stage entrepreneurial activity before and during the european crisis  we used the global entrepreneurship monitor adult population survey data from southern european countries  greece  spain  italy and portugal  and northern european countries  sweden  norway and finland  in 2007  2010  2012 and 2013  we performed logistic regression analysis to identify the role of individual characteristics  self efficacy  perceptions of opportunities  role model and risk perceptions  and social norms  desirable career choice  status and respect and public media  on the early stage entrepreneurial activity  tea   results show that individual characteristics are the most important predictor of entrepreneurial activity  and this effect stays stable throughout the time of the crisis  and social norms have an absent or low effect on entrepreneurial activity  with slight fluctuations during the crisis  these results highlight the role of individual predictors on the entrepreneurial activity despite the macroeconomic environment  which empathizes the importance of education and training to promote the entrepreneurial mindset and attitude

 priced just for me  the role of interpersonal attachment style on consumer responses to customized pricing customized pricing is an increasing phenomenon in the marketplace  but little is known about factors influencing consumer responses to customized pricing  the present paper seeks to gain an understanding of how  why  and when this emerging pricing mechanism may offer benefits  specifically  this research focuses on how consumers respond to customized pricing tactics and  more specifically  on how interpersonal attachment orientations impact consumers  responses to prices offered in the presence of a customized pricing program  the results of 3 studies suggest that customized pricing programs likely create an expectation for a discounted price among securely attached individuals  such that these consumers are dissatisfied paying the shelf price in the presence of a customized pricing program  overall  the results provide evidence that  although customized pricing programs are often used to enhance consumer evaluations  they may not always be effective  this paper advances prior research by integrating important considerations for both pricing and customization strategies based on individual and situational differences in attachment orientations  
 pricing double barrier options under a volatility regime switching model with psychological barriers the prices of lots of assets have been proved in literature to exhibit special behaviors around psychological barriers  which is an important fact needed to be considered when pricing derivatives  in this paper  we discuss the valuation problem of double barrier options under a volatility regime switching model where there exist psychological barriers in the prices of underlying assets  the volatility can shift between two regimes  that is to say  when the asset price rises up or falls down through the psychological barrier  the volatility takes two different values  using the laplace transform approach  we obtain the price of the double barrier knock out call option as well as its delta  we also provide the eigenfunction expansion pricing formula and examine the effect of the psychological barrier on the option price and delta  finding that the gamma of the option is discontinuous at such barriers

 product market advertising  heterogeneous beliefs  and the long run performance of initial public offerings we study the long run effects of product market advertising on the equity of firms conducting initial public offerings  ipos   we find that firms going public with a greater extent of advertising prior to their ipos are valued higher both in the ipo as well as in the immediate aftermarket  are associated with greater upward price revisions from the pre ipo filing range means  and have smaller long run post ipo stock returns  the above results hold even after controlling for the effects of investor attention  as proxied by the pre ipo media coverage received by firms going public  we show  using a number of additional tests  that the above findings are consistent with the implications of the heterogeneous beliefs theories of miller  1977   harrison and kreps  1978   and morris  1996   along with an assumption that product market advertising increases the heterogeneity in outside investor beliefs about firms going public   c 2017 elsevier b v  all rights reserved

 productivity and participation values for cooperative goals to limit free riding and promote performance in international joint ventures this study holds that the development of cooperative goals instead of competitive goals among joint venture partners helps to limit free riding and promote performance in ijvs  the results collected from 75 pairs of chinese and foreign joint venture partners suggest that productivity and participation values strengthen the partners  beliefs that their goals are cooperatively related  which in turn  reduces free riding and promotes performance  whereas competitive goals promote free riding and obstruct joint performance  the paper also suggests how cooperation and competition research can complement established theoretical frameworks on the conditions and dynamics that result in ijv productivity  
 profitability patterns in the interest rate derivatives market this study identifies profitability patterns and their determinants in the global interest rate derivatives market  although this market is the world s largest financial market in terms of nominal value  there has been basically no academic research on profitability owing to missing data  to address this problem  a new analytical method has been developed  using this new method  the study shows that interest rate derivatives have been a substantial source of profitability that have netted a total average annual profit of more than usd 82 billion for banks since 2009  furthermore  the study shows that counterparty type  market position  i e  being one of the top 5 banks   and trade currency are determinants of the profitability of a trade  for other features of a trade  such as duration or notional amount  no correlation with profitability is found  finally  the impact of changes of the market structure on profitability driven by regulatory initiatives is discussed qualitatively

 psychological biases of individual investors and financial satisfaction traditional finance theory is based on the principle of maximization of utility and explains how choices are made by rational people  although the theory provides numerous insights  observation of actual behavior of people was seen to be different from what the theory predicted  the homo economicus is in reality a homo sapien who has emotions and beliefs that help to filter the content from his or her environment  these beliefs and preferences that arise due to cognitive limitations  presence of emotions  and various psychological motives guide or bias his or her decisions  much literature states that the biases should be corrected as they negatively impact financial behaviour and individual s well being  however  evolutionary psychology considers biases as design features of human mind  thus  biases are not always bad  as at times  these biases can help the individual investor to choose the best course of action from the multiple possibilities and enable committing the less costly mistakes  thereby helping the individual to achieve satisficing behaviour  this paper aims to explore the investor biases and see whether they are related to the financial satisfaction of the individuals  financial satisfaction is the measure of satisfaction with one s financial situation  the results showed that overconfidence bias  reliance on expert bias  and self control bias have a positive and significant association with financial satisfaction levels  association of a few other biases with financial satisfaction was also observed under certain control conditions  this study provides further insights on investor behavior and paves the way for various possibilities for future research

 pursuing quality  how search costs and uncertainty magnify gender based double standards in a multistage evaluation process despite lab based evidence supporting the argument that double standards by which one group is unfairly held to stricter standards than another explain observed gender differences in evaluations  it remains unclear whether double standards also affect evaluations in organization and market contexts  where competitive pressures create a disincentive to discriminate  using data from a field study of investment professionals sharing recommendations on an online platform  and drawing on status theory  we identify the conditions under which double standards in multistage evaluations contribute to unequal outcomes for men and women  we find that double standards disadvantaging women are most likely when evaluators face heightened search costs related to the number of candidates being compared or higher levels of uncertainty stemming from variation in the amount of pertinent information available  we rule out that systematic gender differences in the actions or characteristics of the investment professionals being evaluated are driving these results  by more carefully isolating the role of this status based mechanism of discrimination for perpetuating gender inequality  this study identifies not only whether but also the conditions under which gender based double standards lead to a female disadvantage  even when relevant and objective information about performance is readily available

 real estate fund openings and cannibalization this article examines the trade offs in launching new real estate funds  specifically open end  direct property funds  this investment vehicle  which is designed to provide the risk return benefits of private market real estate  is available to retail investors in a number of countries  at the same time  these funds are also subject to liquidity risk  because they hold an inherently illiquid asset in an open end structure  this format presents fund family managers with unique challenges  particularly with the decision to open new funds  the data consist of 2 127 german fund openings across 76 fund families in 12 asset classes over the 1992 2010 period  including a wide range of asset classes allows for a comparison between real estate and other investment objectives  we find a substantial cannibalization effect across the existing real estate funds of a family  while we note the opposite effecti e   flows into existing funds increase following a fund opening within the same objectivefor all other asset classes  our analysis of fund opening determinants shows that inflows mitigate the cannibalization risk for new real estate funds  additional evidence highlights the role of scale and scope economies in real estate fund openings  overall  the results provide new insights into the relatively large size and small number of real estate funds when compared to mutual funds dedicated to other investment objectives  
 recommendation in feature space sphere recently  recommendation algorithms have been widely used in many e commerce platforms to recommend items to users on the basis of their preferences to improve selling efficiency  matrix factorization methods which extract latent features of users and items by decomposing the rating matrix have achieved success in rating prediction  but almost all of these algorithms are designed to fit the rating matrix directly to get the latent features and ignore the user item relationship in feature space  to this end  in this paper  we propose a recommendation in feature space sphere  rfss  which takes into account the relationship between users and items in feature space  different from the conventional latent feature based recommendation algorithms  the proposed algorithm supposes that if a user likes an item  the user is close to the item in feature space  meanwhile  the closer a user and an item are in feature space  the higher the predicted rating will be  and an adaptive user dependent coefficient is introduced to map the user item distances to the predicted ratings  extensive experiments on four real world datasets have been conducted  the results of which show that our proposed method outperforms the state of the art recommendation algorithms   c  2017 elsevier b v  all rights reserved  
 reconceptualising hierarchies  the disaggregation and dispersion of headquarters in multinational corporations in this paper  we provide an introduction to the special issue entitled divide and rule  the emergence and implications of increasingly disaggregated and dispersed headquarters activities in contemporary firms   the purpose is two fold  first  we propose a conceptualization of headquarters activities as a dynamic system in which activities can be distributed organizationally and spatially  we explicitly break with the dominant view of the prior research on the headquarters  as a single  identifiable unit in one specific location  second  building on the manuscripts accepted for publication in this special issue  we outline research implications and put forward an agenda for research on the emergence and continuous management of disaggregated and dispersed headquarters systems  
 reconnecting with the past in social media  the moderating role of social influence in nostalgia marketing on pinterest nostalgia marketing practices in social media help brands link consumers with happier times from the past  a randomized 2  evoked nostalgia  high vs  low x2  social influence  high vs  low  between subjects factorial design experiment was conducted to examine the effects of nostalgia and social influence on consumers  judgments in the brand management context of pinterest boards  the results revealed the strong main effect of evoked nostalgia on consumers  attitudes toward the pinterest board and the brand  purchase intention  willingness to pass along branded pins  and brand consumer relationship quality  furthermore  this study discovered the significant moderating role of social influence for all dependent measures  strongly  vs  weakly  evoked nostalgia generated more favorable responses only when social influence was high  in contrast  there were no significant differences between strongly and weakly evoked nostalgia when social influence was low  theoretical contributions to the nostalgia literature and managerial implications for social media marketing are discussed

 red queen competitive imitation in the uk mobile phone industry this paper uses red queen competition theory to examine competitive imitation  we conceptualize imitative actions by a focal firm and its rivals along two dimensions  imitation scope  which describes the extent to which a firm imitates a wide range  as opposed to a narrow range  of new product technologies introduced by rivals  and imitation speed  namely the pace at which it imitates these technologies  we argue that focal firm imitation scope and imitation speed drive performance  as well as imitation scope and speed decisions by rivals  which in turn influence focal firm performance  we also argue that the impact of this self reinforcing red queen process on firms  actions and performance is contingent on levels of product technology heterogeneity defined as the extent to which the industry has multiple designs  resulting in product variety  we test our hypotheses using imitative actions by mobile phone vendors and their sales performance in the u k  from 1997 to 2008

 reflection toward creativity  team reflexivity as a linking mechanism between team goal orientation and team creative performance this study aims at testing the mediating role of team reflexivity in the relationships between team learning  performance prove  and performance avoid goal orientations and team creative performance and assessing the relative importance of the three types of team goal orientation in team reflexivity and creative performance  we conducted study 1 on 68 student teams by using a two wave time lagged design  in study 2  we carried out a cross sectional field study on 108 intact work teams in diverse korean companies  team learning goal orientation was significantly associated with team creative performance  while team learning and performance prove goal orientations were equally influential in predicting team reflexivity  team performance avoid goal orientation had no relationship with team reflexivity and creative performance  team reflexivity mediated the relationships between team learning and performance prove goal orientations and team creative performance  by revealing that team learning and performance prove goal orientations can contribute to team creative performance through the facilitation of team reflective process  this study provides practitioners with insight into critical antecedents and team process that are conducive to the creative performance of work teams  this is one of the first studies to explore a mediating mechanism between team goal orientation and creative performance  this study attends to the role of team reflexivity as a key team regulatory process that underlies the relationship between team goal orientation and team performance  furthermore  the use of multiple studies in different contexts strengthens the robustness of the study findings  
 regulation and adaptation of management accounting innovations  the case of economic value added in thai state owned enterprises research on the diffusion of management accounting innovations  mais  has grown into a substantial literature which  draws attention to how diffusion processes can be fuelled by compulsory regulation  however  relatively little is known about how mais interact with wider regulatory processes in society and how this affects the adaptation of such innovations as they diffuse across organisations  this paper extends research on this topic by addressing the questions of how regulators mediate the adaptation of mais and how this mediation affects the use of such innovations across regulatees  we explore these questions in relation to the evolution of economic value added  eva  tm   as a compulsory performance management system for state owned enterprises  soes  in thailand  theoretically  we extend research on management innovations with sociological research  which sees regulation as an evolving and collaborative process that unfolds as an integral part of broader  societal reform programmes  consistent with this perspective  we show how regulators can fill a key role as mediators by engaging in ongoing consultations with the suppliers of mais as well as regulatees  and how this imbues the regulatory standards that govern the use of such innovations with considerable flexibility  we also extend this perspective on regulation by showing how the regulatory standards governing eva  tm  were influenced by multiple  and partly competing  reform programmes centred on other innovations  in addition  we show how the mediating role of regulators enables regulatees to influence the evolution of regulatory standards and how this facilitates compliance with regulation and allows regulatees to adapt mais to industry specific regulations and cultural characteristics  we discuss the implications of these findings for the sociological literature on regulation informing this paper and for research on the diffusion of mais   c  2017 elsevier ltd  all rights reserved  
 reit leverage and return performance  keep your eye on the target this article examines u s  reit leverage decisions and their effects on risk and return  we find that the speed at which reits close the gap between current debt levels and target leverage levels is 17  annually  reits that are highly levered relative to the average reit tend to underperform reits with less debt in their capital structure  however  reits that are highly levered relative to their target leverage tend to perform better on a risk adjusted basis than under levered reits  taken together  our results show that reit leverage has significant return performance effects conditional on deviations from target leverage  
 relationship between corporate foundation giving and the economic cycle for consumer  and industrial oriented firms panel data from 179 corporate foundations over a 9 year period were analyzed to examine how charitable giving was influenced by a recent economic slowdown  the results revealed that foundations sponsored by consumer oriented firms reduced their support for charitable causes as economic conditions worsened  foundations sponsored by industrial oriented firms increased charitable contributions during the economic slowdown  the results were interpreted as being consistent with the proposed motivation for corporate giving  more specifically  it was assumed that charitable giving decisions by foundations sponsored by consumer oriented firms are consistent with a marketing related objective to increase sales through corporate philanthropy  foundations sponsored by industrial oriented firms were assumed to make charitable giving decisions more from an altruistic perspective  to achieve maximum corporate benefits from charitable donations  it was recommended that corporate foundations develop a giving program that avoids the potential negative consequences associated with reducing foundation giving when the need for charitable contribution increases

 relationship based product innovations  evidence from the global supply chain global supply chains offer a range of expertise to suppliers interested in generating innovative new products through capitalizing on the closeness of their working relationships with other firms  however  current knowledge on whether and how relational capital between firms can be leveraged for innovation is equivocal  conceptualizing little of the underlying processes responsible for mobilizing relational capital  as well as yielding mostly contradictory empirical results  this study proposes and tests the intermediate mechanisms of proactive customer orientation and joint learning capability as two distinctive capabilities that may account for how relational capital drives relationship based innovation  our conceptual model posits that the relational capital innovation link is neither simple nor direct  an empirical test on 204 taiwanese suppliers demonstrates the complexity of the innovation generation process  two pathways from relational capital to innovation are revealed  joint learning capability fully mediates the link  whereas the role of proactive customer orientation is moderated by aspects of the suppliers  ties to their international customers  our theory is thereby largely confirmed  finally  implications for the theory and practice of innovation in global supply chain relationships are drawn  
 remembering satiation  the role of working memory in satiation consumers typically enjoy an experience less with repeated consumption  yet this rate of satiation can dramatically vary across contexts and individuals  building on the notion that satiation is constructed during consumption  we demonstrate that people satiate faster when they employ a greater working memory capacity  we establish this result in four studies across multiple experienced stimuli while using a range of measures of working memory capacity  we also develop insight into the underlying cognitive mechanism using mediation and moderation to show that people utilizing a larger working memory capacity satiate faster because they more deeply encode and process each stimulus  this subsequently leads to a sense that they have consumed that stimulus more times  and hence greater satiation  this provides direct evidence that working memory capacity is a critical cognitive mechanism underlying satiation  and it helps us potentially understand a range of satiation phenomena

 reprint of  linking conservation and welfare  a theoretical model with application to nepal theoretical articles linking conservation and welfare find a negative relationship between these two variables while empirical studies show that land protection may be positively related to welfare  several authors attribute this empirical result to the development of ecotourism in protected areas  we thus argue that the gap between the theory and existing empirical results is partly explained by the fact that most theoretical models do not account for a productive activity on protected land  therefore  we develop a theoretical model in which conservation allows developing an alternative sector and show that the relationship between conservation and welfare is u shaped  we test this theoretical prediction using nepalese data and find that conservation combined with ecotourism is indeed positively related to local welfare   c  2017 published by elsevier inc  
 reputation as a governance mechanism  evidence from payout policy of insider controlled firms in taiwan this paper examines the effect of entrenched insiders  reputational concerns on corporate payout policy in taiwan  a market in which typical public firms are controlled by a single dominant shareholder who is subject to weak takeover threats and has incentives and abilities to extract private benefits by oppressing minority equity holders  the reputation building hypothesis predicts that firms with higher expropriation risk by a controlling shareholder make more payouts to credibly commit not to expropriate minority shareholders  thereby establishing reputation in the capital market for risk diversification and low cost external financing  i show that corporate payout intensity is significantly and positively correlated with measures related to the moral hazard of dominant owners  the reputation effect manifests in firms that most value it  the interaction analyses indicate that younger  smaller  or growth firms with higher controlling shareholder expropriation risk pay more cash dividends  moreover  firms are less likely to omit dividends and more likely to resume dividends when their controlling shareholders are more entrenched  finally  i show that the value of cash dividends is higher for firms with higher controlling shareholder expropriation risk and that expected dividend increases in these firms are value enhancing

 resource allocation and firm boundaries in a modern economy  much of the allocation of financial and nonfinancial resources is mediated by organizations  this essay points to three general features of this mediating role of organizations in the resource allocation process  one line of argument relates to the distinct opportunities and opportunity costs that an organization faces  the set of investment opportunities for organizations differs as a result of their privileged access to different investment opportunities  the second line of argument considers the impact of differential beliefs and perspectives on the resource allocation process  the diversity of independent budgetary entities  both internal to and external to the organization  is argued to importantly influence the heterogeneity of the bases of selection among alternative investment opportunities  lastly  this mediation of resource allocation by the firm plays a particularly important role with respect to the allocation of resources over time on a given initiative  organizations do not simply buffer initiatives from selection but potentially provide different bases for interim selection processes  
 resource allocation and strategy resource allocation is fundamental to strategic management  yet  surprisingly  there is not a large body of literature specifically about the allocation of financial  physical  technological  and human resources that support firm strategies  this special issue seeks to bring renewed attention to resource allocation as an important topic for strategy research  the curated set of articles and commentaries offer conceptual and empirical contributions that assess the current state of research on the topic  present analyses and new insights  and propose promising directions for future research  through this special issue  we hope to encourage more research that examines resource allocation as a central focus of study for achieving deeper and better understandings about firm strategies  
 resource allocation in strategic factor markets  a realistic real options approach to generating competitive advantage this paper develops a realistic real option theory of resource allocation decisions in strategic factor markets  competitive advantage in factor markets is underpinned by market failures that allow firms to acquire assets at less than their value in use  we recognize that market failure may result from uncertainty regarding the current and or future value of an asset  which map  respectively  to uncertainty as modeled in the feedback learning and real options literatures  the realistic real option framework we develop grafts insights from the strategic factor market  feedback learning  and real option valuation literatures  we argue that competitive advantage may emerge not only from luck  or ex ante differences in information or complementary assets  but also because firms differ in a specific type of learning abilitythe ability to integrate new information to exercise a contingent claim on an asset in a factor market  we dimensionalize these differences in terms of information processing and belief updating  argue that these differences lead to different resource allocation decisions  and suggest how these decisions may generate competitive advantage  
 resources discovery in the cloud environments using collaborative filtering and ontology relations nowadays  cloud services have been providing a wide source of information and yet the expansion of these services has led to their own particular problems in this subject  discovering of the appropriate resources or services is a major challenge in the cloud computing  therefore  many methods are proposed to tackle this problem  also  in the cloud environments  ontology is a description of the concepts and relationships that can exist for a cloud service or group of services  on the other hand  for a certain item  user s interest according to the information of their profiles are predicted by collaborative filtering  it uses a collection of users with similar interests to predict interesting information for target users  however  despite the importance of the semantic relations among the cloud services  a few papers consider these relations to discover the proper resources  therefore  this paper aims at proposing a method to discover the cloud services via semantic concepts and collaborative filtering  the obtained results from experiments have illustrated that the presented approach improves the efficiency of service discovery in the cloud computing and obtains fewer execution times against the current approaches   c  2017 elsevier b v  all rights reserved  
 rethinking  top down  and  bottom up  roles of top and middle managers in organizational change  implications for employee support in this study we integrate insights from top down  and bottom up  traditions in organizational change research to understand employees  varying dispositions to support change  we distinguish between change initiation and change execution roles and identify four possible role configurations in which top managers  tms  and middle managers  mms  can feature in change  we contend that both tms and mms can play change initiation and or change execution roles  tms and mms have different strengths and limitations for taking on different change roles  and their relative strengths and limitations are compounded or attenuated based on the specific configuration of change roles  we subsequently hypothesize employee support for change in relation to different tm mm change role configurations  our findings show that change initiated by tms does not engender above average level of employee support  however  change initiated by mms engenders above average level of employee support  and even more so  if tms handle the change execution  
 revisiting the decomposition of cost efficiency for non homothetic technologies  a directional distance function approach in the early 1980 s kopp and diewert proposed a popular method to decompose cost efficiency into allocative and technical efficiency for parametric functional forms based on the radial approach initiated by farrell  we show that  relying on recently proposed homogeneity and duality results  their approach is unnecessary for self dual homothetic production functions  while it is inconsistent in the non homothetic case  by stressing that for homothetic technologies the radial distance function can be correctly interpreted as a technical efficiency measure  since allocative efficiency is independent of the output level and radial input reductions leave it unchanged  we contend that for non homothetic technologies this is not the case because optimal input demands depend on the output targeted by the firm  as does the inequality between marginal rates of substitution and market prices allocative inefficiency  we demonstrate that a correct definition of technical efficiency corresponds to the directional distance function because its flexibility ensures that allocative efficiency is kept unchanged through movements in the input production possibility set when solving technical inefficiency  and therefore the associated cost reductions can be solely and rightly ascribed to technical engineering improvements  the new methodology allowing for a consistent decomposition of cost inefficiency is illustrated resorting to simple examples of non homothetic production functions  
 riding off into the sunset  organizational sensegiving  shareholder sensemaking  and reactions to ceo retirement we test hypotheses derived from resource dependence and sensemaking sensegiving theoretical lenses in the context of ceo succession  focusing on an under researched yet prevalent type of executive turnover   ceo retirement  using event study methodology and a sample of ceo retirements from s p 1500 firms during the 2003 12 period  we find that  all else equal  shareholders  perceptions of organizations  capacity to serve their interests are adversely affected when a retirement related change occurs in the leadership structure  specifically  in line with resource dependence theory  we find that ceo retirement disclosures typically generate negative abnormal returns  furthermore  in line with the sensemaking perspective  we find that the magnitude of shareholders  reactions is contingent on the lexical sensegiving cues contained in the organizational narratives that are released to capital markets via executive retirement announcements  overall  our theory and results point to ceo retirement events as consequential in the eyes of shareholders  challenging an important assumption of extant succession research  moreover  they suggest that shareholders  interpretation of these events is influenced by organizational sensegiving  highlighting the important role of organizational communication around succession events

 rollover risk as market discipline  a two sided inefficiency why does the market discipline that financial intermediaries face seem too weak during booms and too strong during crises  this paper shows in a general equilibrium setting that rollover risk as a disciplining device is effective only if all intermediaries face purely idiosyncratic risk  however  if assets are correlated  a two sided inefficiency arises  good aggregate states have intermediaries taking excessive risks  while bad aggregate states suffer from costly fire sales  the driving force behind this inefficiency is an amplifying feedback loop between asset values and market discipline  in equilibrium  financial intermediaries inefficiently amplify both positive and negative aggregate shocks   c  2017 elsevier b v  all rights reserved  
 safe driving communication  a regulatory focus perspective this research article examines the effects of self regulation on adolescents  aggressive driving tendencies and their attitudes toward safe driving communication  two experimental studies demonstrate that an individual s regulatory orientation is a good predictor of aggressive driving tendencies and that self regulation plays a moderating role on the effects of safe driving messages on recipients  attitudes  specifically  the findings reveal that promotion oriented  vs  prevention oriented  individuals are more likely to demonstrate aggressive driving tendencies  in addition  promotion oriented individuals show more favorable attitudes toward gain framed safe driving messages than loss framed messages  prevention oriented individuals show the opposite pattern  implications for theory and practice are discussed  
 sailing through marketing  a critical assessment of spatiality in marketing literature marketing has historically been entangled with the study of geography  which has become a very popular focus in the marketing literature nowadays  however  spatially oriented perspectives in marketing tend to rest on a conceptual divide between place oriented and space oriented thinking  thus inhibiting the production of more eclectic and creative spatial knowledge  this conceptual paper endeavors to overcome this dichotomy by rethinking spatiality in terms of boundedness  openness  functionality and expressivity  these constitute the four cardinal points of a  compass rose  that marketers can use to reassess and combine different appreciations of spatiality  the paper suggests the idea of  sailing  as an appropriate metaphor to explore pioneering multidimensional appreciations of geography in marketing and go beyond the divide between place oriented and space oriented thinking  
 say on pay effectiveness  corporate governance mechanisms  and ceo compensation alignment say on pay  sop  is a relatively new governance mechanism that allows shareholders to pronounce on the suitability on executives  compensation  the literature has mainly examined sop effects on anglo saxon contexts of corporate governance  reporting mixed results and highlighting the need to deepen our understanding of its real impact  as well as its interactions with other mechanisms of governance  concerning these gaps  the present research analyzes the effectiveness of sop as a mechanism for aligning ceo compensation in the context of spanish listed companies   a good representative model of continental european systems of corporate governance    it also examines the moderating effect of board monitoring and ownership structure  using panel data and linear regression methodologies on a set of companies from 2013 to 2016  the results show that sop generally increases the alignment of ceo compensation  although its effectiveness is reduced in companies with overcompensated ceos and in owner managed companies   c  2017 acede  published by elsevier espana  s l u

 scenario based strategizing  advancing the applicability in strategists  teams for over 40 years  scenarios have been promoted as a key technique for forming strategies in uncertain environments  however  many challenges remain  in this article  we discuss a novel approach designed to increase the applicability of scenario based strategizing in top management teams  drawing on behavioural strategy as a theoretical lens  we design a yardstick to study the impact of scenario based strategizing  we then describe our approach  which includes developing scenarios and alternative strategies separately and supporting the strategy selection through an integrated assessment of the goal based efficacy and robustness  to facilitate the collaborative strategizing in teams  we propose a matrix with robustness and efficacy as the two axes  which we call the parmenides matrix  we assess the impact of the novel approach by applying it in two cases  at a governmental agency  german environmental ministry  and a firm affected by disruptive change  bosch  leading global supplier of technology and solutions   
 scenario driven roadmapping for technology foresight this paper presents a novel method for using scenarios for technology foresight  technology foresight is a well established discipline  practised with popular foresight methods such as roadmapping and scenario planning  applying each foresight method reveals limitations in practice  some of which can be addressed by combining methods  following calls for combining foresight methods  and past attempts to integrate scenario planning and technology roadmapping  we propose a novel method for their combination  the resulting method    scenario driven roadmapping  differs in  i  using scenario planning first to identify plausible images of the general environment and then using the scenarios for technology roadmapping  and ii  taking advantage of  flex points    critical developments which would signal transitions along particular pathways   to create a  radar  to support effective monitoring of the environment over time  this new combined method takes advantage of the strengths of both methods  while addressing their limitations  a case study vignette centred on the work of a special interest group for radio frequency identification  rfid  technology adoption in the english national health service is presented to illustrate and reflect upon the use in practice of the  scenario driven roadmapping  method  participants were able to develop a detailed technology roadmap with clear  flex points  helping to connect present circumstances with pathways towards future scenarios  we report on how participants engaged with the scenario driven method and outcomes achieved were recorded  
 schooling and productivity growth  evidence from a dual growth accounting application to us states this paper exploits the dual growth accounting framework to determine the effect of schooling on total factor productivity  tfp  growth for u s  states over 1980 2010  the paper contributes to the literature by constructing tfp growth measures  in the process  both real wage growth and real user cost growth measures at the state level  the growth accounting exercise reveals that states display considerable heterogeneity in tfp growth with both real wage growth and real user cost growth equally contributing to it  while our econometric estimates reveal significant tfp growth effects associated with college education  they are considerably lower in magnitude when compared to the earlier studies  productivity growth effects associated with high school education remain insignificant  our empirical findings are further validated by the use of instrumental variable estimation to address the endogeneity of the schooling variables and are also robust to the inclusion of a rich set of control variables  alternative tfp growth measures as well as to the tests to draw robust inferences in the presence of weak instruments  
 science  technology  and innovation for economic competitiveness  the role of smart specialization in less developed countries smart specialization  ss  is a policy concept that has gained significant momentum in europe despite a frail theoretical background and implementation difficulties  these challenges become critical in the case of less developed economies that often lack regional autonomy  a strong sti base  and local capabilities to identify and sustain such ss strategies  combining elements from evolutionary economics and the export led literature  i propose a framework that anchors the role of ss in the national innovation policy of such laggards  as a complementary avenue for improving competitiveness and growth  moreover  to assist policy makers in lagging regions or countries  i advance a diagnostic tool to identify potential areas for ss  and also address the systemic and the regional sectoral bottlenecks in these domains  i exemplify the use of this tool in the case of bulgaria by using a large battery of quantitative and qualitative indicators from publicly available data  this type of investigation may be useful for other less developed economies to kick start this process and identify prima facie ss candidates

 seeding  referral  and recommendation  creating profitable word of mouth programs in recent years  word of mouth  wom  marketing has been the subject of considerable interest among managers and academics alike  however  there is very little common knowledge on what drives the value of wom programs and how they should be designed to optimize value  firms therefore frequently rely on relatively simple metrics to measure the success of their wom marketing efforts and mainly use rules of thumb when making crucial program design decisions  this article proposes a new method to measure wom program value that is based on the impact of wom on the firm s customer equity  it then provides recommendations for the five main questions managers face when planning a wom program  who to target  when to launch the program  where to launch it  which incentives to offer  and how many participants to include  
 seeing is not necessarily liking  advancing research on package design with eye tracking this paper contributes to the package design research by proposing and verifying process based framework that explain how various package features affect customers visual attention  an exploratory study was carried out in virtual settings  deploying eye tracking methodology in combination with package collages in order to assure a reasonably realistic product category context  yet better control over non package factors that affect attention  findings suggest that physical and semantic package features affect attention during the  orientation  phase and reveal how efficiently attention is transferred to the brand in the  discovery  phase  results in addition reveal that packages that attract the most attention are not necessarily likeable or suitable  but also that recall is a questionable measure of attention  the study provides important implications by informing management on how to break the visual clutter and stand out from competitors  while staying in line with the product category  code   
 seeing  believing  and behaving  heterogeneous effects of an information intervention on household water treatment providing information about environmental health risks only sometimes induces protective action  this raises questions about whether and how risk information is understood and acted upon  and how responses vary across contexts  to characterize such variation  we stratified a randomized experiment related to household water quality across two periurban areas in cambodia  when we showed specific evidence of water contamination to lower ses households who were initially more optimistic about water safety  they altered their beliefs about health risk and increased their demand for a treatment product  however  demand for the treatment product among higher and initially more pessimistic ses households did not change significantly  these findings highlight the importance of better understanding heterogeneity in the specific drivers of responses to health risk information   c  2016 elsevier inc  all rights reserved  
 self reliance  a gender perspective on its relationship to communality and leadership evaluations we posit a female advantage in the relationship between self reliance and leadership evaluations  we test this prediction in four studies  first  using multi rater evaluations of young managers  we find that self reliance relates positively to leadership evaluations for women  but not for men  next  in each of three experiments  we manipulate the gender of a leader and the agentic trait he or she displays  e g   self reliance  dominance  no discrete agentic trait   we find that self reliant female leaders are evaluated as better leaders than self reliant male leaders are  in contrast  we find a male advantage or no gender advantage for dominant leaders or leaders who are described positively  but not in terms of any discrete agentic trait  consistent with expectancy violation theory  the female advantage in the relationship between self reliance and leadership evaluations emerges because self reliant female leaders are seen as similarly competent  but more communal  than self reliant male leaders are  we discuss the implications of these findings for understanding the effects of self reliance  gender stereotypes  and stereotype violations on leadership evaluations  
 seller beware  how bundling affects valuation how does bundling affect valuation  this research proposes the asymmetry hypothesis in the valuation of bundles  consumers demand more compensation for the loss of items from bundles  compared with the loss of the same items in isolation  yet they express lower willingness to pay for items added to bundles  compared with the same items purchased separately  this asymmetry persists because bundling causes consumers to perceive multiple items as a single  inseparable gestalt unit  thus  consumers resist altering the  whole  of the bundle by removing or adding items  six studies demonstrate this asymmetry across judgments of monetary value  studies 1 and 2  and  dis  satisfaction  study 3   moreover  bundle composition the ability of different items to create the impression of a  whole  moderates the effect of bundling on valuation  study 4   and the need to replacemissing items  i e   restoring the  whole   mediates the effect of bundling on compensation demanded for losses  study 5   finally  the authors explore a boundary condition  the effect is attenuated for items that complete a set  study 6   
 selling value in business markets  individual and organizational factors for turning the idea into action modern business to business firms focus increasingly on understanding and selling value  as a strategic priority and to achieve marketing and sales excellence  yet many companies struggle to implement their value orientation  without sufficient knowledge of how to translate it into sales practice  this study therefore examines value based selling  vbs  as an implementation of value based marketing at the sales force level  the proposed motivation opportunity ability framework integrates individual  and organizational level antecedents  outcomes  and moderators in an attempt to explain the adoption and performance outcomes of vbs in business markets  multilevel path modeling with cross sectional survey data from 944 salespeople and managers in 43 sales organizations confirms the prediction that vbs enhances salespeople s performance  beyond that achieved with established selling approaches  however  firms need specific types of salespeople and dedicated organizational support for effective vbs implementation  a salesperson s learning orientation and networking competencies emerge as critical antecedents  organizational value assessment tools can compensate for individual salespeople s lack of learning orientation  reference marketing efforts also strengthen the performance outcomes of vbs  finally  vbs is most effective in organizational settings where perceived customers value demandingness is lower  enabling salespeople to use vbs as a proactive selling approach  
 sensor based entrepreneurship  a framework for developing new products and services as the internet of things  lot  begins to dominate the technology landscape  there will be new products and services that will become technically and financially feasible  internet technologies and advancements in social interaction tools have led to an increase in the use of the crowd as a provider of business solutions  yet  we have seen a mere fraction of the possibilities of crowdsourcing technologies  this is because most of the development  discussion  and research around crowdsourcing has focused on active input crowdsourcing  however  the real transformative pressure will come from passive sources of data generated primarily by developing and growing sensor technologies  this next generation of crowdsourcing will be a game changer for entrepreneurial opportunities  as crowdsourcing systems proliferate  more input will be acquired from sensors  artificial intelligence  bots  and other devices  as a result of this explosion  the variety of product and service opportunities will swell as entrepreneurs become more aware of technologies merging such as the combination of crowdsourcing  sensors  and big data into a new type of entrepreneurship  sensor based entrepreneurship  the purpose of this research is to contribute by  1  clarifying the next generation of crowdsourcing and  2  developing and presenting a framework to help sensor based entrepreneurs plan  develop  and map their new products and services   c  2017 kelley school of business  indiana university  published by elsevier inc  all rights reserved  
 sentiment labeling for extending initial labeled data to improve semi supervised sentiment classification in recent decades  analyzing the sentiments in online customer reviews has become important to many businesses and researchers  however  insufficient amount of labeled training corpus is a bottleneck for machine learning approaches  self training is one of the promising semi supervised techniques which does not require large amounts of labeled data  however  self training also suffers from an incorrect labeling problem along with insufficient amount of labeled data  this study proposed a semi supervised learning framework that adds only confidently predicted data to the training corpus in order to enrich the initial classifier in self training  the experimental results indicate that the proposed method performed better than self training   c  2017 elsevier b v  all rights reserved  
 sentimental value and gift giving  givers  fears of getting it wrong prevents them from getting it right sentimental value is the value derived from an emotionally laden item s associations with significant others  or special events or times in one s life  the present research demonstrates that when faced with the choice between sentimentally valuable gifts and gifts with superficial attributes that match the preferences of the recipient  givers give the latter much more often than recipients would prefer to receive such gifts  this asymmetry appears to be driven by givers feeling relatively certain that preference matching gifts will be well liked by recipients  but relatively uncertain that the same is true for sentimentally valuable gifts  three studies demonstrate this gift giving mismatch and validate the proposed mechanism across a variety of gift giving occasions and giver receiver relationship types  the contribution of these findings to the gift giving literature  as well as directions for future research  are discussed   c  2017 society for consumer psychology  published by elsevier inc  all rights reserved  
 serialisation and the use of twitter  keeping the conversation alive in public policy scenario projects scenario planning projects have been used in a variety of organisational settings to explore future uncertainty  the scenario process is often a participative one involving heterogeneous stakeholder groups from multiple organisations  particularly when exploring issues of wider public concern  facilitated workshops are a common setting for scenario projects  typically requiring people to be physically present in order to participate and engage with others for the duration of the project  during workshops  participants progress through the stages of the process  generating content relevant to each stage and ultimately the scenarios themselves  however  the periods between workshops and other episodes of activity  e g  interviewing stakeholders  are rarely mentioned in such accounts  thus we know very little about what activities take place between such activities  when they occur and who is involved  this is a particular issue for larger scale scenario projects that run over a period of weeks or months and involve multiple workshops  in such cases organisers and facilitators have to consider how to maintain the interest and levels of engagement of participants throughout the duration of the project  a variety of social media exist which allow people to interact with each other virtually  both in real time and asynchronously  we reflect on the use of social media within a project to develop scenarios for the future of the food system around birmingham  uk  in the year 2050  we explore how a particular social media  namely twitter  can be used effectively as part of a scenario planning project  for example to engage participants and encourage contributions to the project  we suggest that twitter can support the serialisation of strategic conversations between the face to face workshops  the paper considers the implications of these reflections for both the scenario process and scenario projects more generally  
 service climate as a moderator of the effects of customer to customer interactions on customer support and service quality this study introduces customer perceived service climate  which captures an individual customer s perception of the extent to which a service organization teaches  prioritizes  and recognizes outstanding customer service through organizational practices and procedures  such a perception is found to significantly and positively influence the outcomes of a customer s already positive interactions with other customers as well as temper outcomes associated with a customer s negative experience of another customer s dysfunctional behaviors  longitudinal results demonstrate that customer perceived service climate creates a potential  spillover  effect  where positive influences of a strong service climate benefit an organization in two ways both through employee actions  as previous research shows  and through customer actions toward one another  i e   supportive behaviors as the current study demonstrates   the development of such supportive behaviors among customers is shown to be critical  as it is these support behaviors from other customers  and not positive or negative customer to customer  c2c  interactions themselves  that ultimately influence a customer s judgment of organizational service quality  service organizations should be aware of the importance of developing positive customer perceptions of service climate to help in positively influencing c2c interactions as well as focusing upon the development of a service environment that enables c2c support behaviors  
 service crisis recovery and firm performance  insights from information breach announcements the extant literature has studied the effects of a firm s service recovery efforts on the reactions of customers and employees following an individual service failure  however  the impact of recovery efforts on a firm s performance after a public and large service failure such as a large scale information breach has received scant attention  to address this gap  this current research develops a framework and finds support for the impact of service crisis recoveries on a firm s performance  as measured by firm idiosyncratic risk  using a unique dataset of service crisis recoveries  the authors find that firms offering compensation  i e   tangible redresses  or process improvement  i e   improvements in organizational processes  show more stable performance  less idiosyncratic risk   from two quarters to two calendar years after the announcement of their recovery plan  in line with the documented dual effect of apologies  firms that offer apology based recoveries display more volatile performance  higher idiosyncratic risk   of note  this volatility increases with the number of affected individuals  and it remains unaffected even when the apology is expressed with high intensity  
 service employee responses to angry customer complaints  the roles of customer status and service climate service employees  emotional and behavioral responses to angry customer complaints were examined to help firms improve their service recovery performance  role played complaints were conducted in a field experiment set in fast food restaurants  actors played customers who complained in an angry fashion to service employees  employees  immediate emotional  i e   expressed anger  and delayed behavioral responses  i e   restitution offered  were observed  a follow up scenario based experimental study was used to retest the hypotheses and add controls to rule out potential rival explanations  in both studies  level of customer status  low vs  high  true experimental design  and strength of a restaurant s service climate  weak vs  strong  quasi experimental design  were manipulated  the findings confirm that employees in a weak service climate expressed more anger and were less likely to offer restitution to low  compared to high status customers  in contrast  in a strong service climate  employee responses were less dependent on customer status and converged at a low level of anger and high probability of restitution offered  furthermore  the consistent immediate affective and delayed behavioral responses suggest that a strong service climate is internalized by frontline employees  this study contributes to service theory by establishing a customer status main effect on both affective and conative employee responses and by confirming service climate as a boundary condition for the customer status main effect  a key implication for managers is that establishing a strong service climate is important for achieving effective service recovery in increasingly diverse societies  
 shady characters  the implications of illicit organizational roles for resilient team performance in this paper we theorize about illicit roles and explore their effects on resilient team performance  we define an illicit role as one whose occupants specialize in activity forbidden by the law  regulatory bodies  or professional societies  in the belief that doing so provides a competitive advantage  using longitudinal data on professional hockey teams  we examine the enforcer a player who specializes in the prohibited activity of fighting  we find that team performance is more disrupted by the injury of an enforcer than by the injury of occupants of other formal roles on the team  in addition  team performance recovers more slowly after this setback to the extent the team tries to replace an enforcer  and the performance disruptions associated with his exit are magnified as a function of his experience with his team  we use these findings to develop new theory about organizational roles that operate outside official channels and formal structures  we suggest that such role occupants are more difficult to replace than their formal counterparts  in part because to enact these roles effectively requires experience in the local social context  
 shifts in modes of governance and sustainable development in the brazilian oil sector this article discusses shifts in modes of governance in the brazilian oil sector over a 60 year period  on the basis of driessen et al  s  2012  framework  we discuss the impact of these shifts on sustainable development  our results suggest that changes in modes of governance were driven by regulation and mostly associated with shifts in both actors and institutional features but that the underlying rationale of prioritising economic outcomes remained unaffected  the results also confirm that a central governance structure remained in place over time and co existed in different modes of governance  petrobras was the backbone of this structure and instrumental in empowering and disempowering non state actors  this article stresses that a mode of governance furthering sustainable development should promote interactions of large numbers of actors and may require active participation of petrobras to encourage rationales that support improvements in social and environmental domains   c  2017 elsevier ltd  all rights reserved

 shortability and asset pricing model  evidence from the hong kong stock market this study explores how the violation of free short selling assumption affects the performance of capm and the fama french three factor model  as existing studies show that short sales constraints affect asset pricing of the stocks  using data from the hong kong stock market which has unique regulations on short selling  we conduct both time series and cross sectional regression analyses to evaluate the performance of the two models under the short sales constraints and the no constraints market environment  the two models perform much worse in the former environment than in the latter  indicating a significant impact of the short sales constraints on the explanatory power of the models  we then augment the two models with a shortability mimicking factor  our results show that the factor has a significant power in explaining both time series and cross sectional variation in the size b m portfolio returns  the addition of the factor to the two models considerably increases their overall performance   c  2017 elsevier b v  all rights reserved  
 should anthropomorphized brands engage customers  the impact of social crowding on brand preferences anthropomorphizing a brand  i e   imbuing a brand with humanlike features  serves as an important brand positioning strategy for marketing managers  this research identifies a key brand anthropomorphization strategy positioning a brand as either oriented to interact with consumers or not  managers generally rely on this brand interaction strategy to enhance consumer brand engagement regardless of the social context  however  given that consumers often experience brands in a social context  this research demonstrates that social crowdedness moderates the positive impact of interaction oriented anthropomorphized brands on consumer brand preferences  specifically  the authors show that consumers  inferences of an anthropomorphized brand s intentionality to interact with them in a socially crowded context trigger greater social withdrawal  thereby resulting in lower preferences for the brand  the authors further demonstrate that the core negative effect of social crowdedness is contingent on the type of crowding  goal related vs  goal unrelated   in particular  a goal related crowding decreases social withdrawal reactions  which  in turn  leads to greater preferences for interaction oriented anthropomorphized brands relative to brands with other positioning strategies  in contrast  the effect of social crowdedness on consumer preferences for interaction oriented anthropomorphized brands remains negative in goal unrelated crowded settings  
 signaling virtue  does firm corporate social performance trajectory moderate the social performance financial performance relationship  over the past 40 years  scholars have demonstrated the effects of corporate social performance  csp  on corporate financial performance  cfp   finding mixed results on the main effect of csp on cfp  this study moves beyond the search for a universal main effect of csp on cfp to examine factors that drive some firms to experience greater returns from their csp efforts  building from the signaling and stakeholder theory definitions of reputation and the trajectory literature in psychology  this study examines the following question  what is the impact of a fines csp reputation on the relationship between csp actions and cfp in the current period  findings based on a sample of 351 us firms demonstrate that firms with either a history of growth in negative csp  a propensity toward increasing negative csp  or a more inconsistent history of positive or negative csp  experience decreased returns from current period investments in csp  
 slogan recall effects on marketplace behaviors  the roles of external search and brand assessment this current study investigates the influence of advertising slogan recall on individuals  brand assessment  and relates these brand assessments to actual marketplace behaviors  the authors propose that the effectiveness of slogan recall will depend on whether individuals conduct an external information search or not  we test the hypotheses using a field study based on an actual advertising campaign implemented by a nonprofit organization  and a follow up controlled experimental study  findings support the notion that the influence of advertising slogan recall on brand assessment  i e   the company intended association and quality  is greater when individuals do not conduct external information search  further  the research finds that brand perceptions mediate the influence of slogan recall on marketplace behaviors  the results imply that managers will receive greater returns on investments in advertising slogans when selling low involvement products rather than high involvement products  
 small bank comparative advantages in alleviating financial constraints and providing liquidity insurance over time we use novel monthly survey data from 1993 to 2012 on small business managerial perceptions of financial constraints and other conditions  matched with information on banks in their local markets  the data suggest that small banks have comparative advantages in alleviating these constraints  these advantages tend to be greater during adverse economic conditions and do not appear to decrease or increase secularly  small banks also appear to have comparative advantages in providing liquidity insurance to small business customers of large banks experiencing liquidity shocks during financial crises  our findings suggest a source of social costs from ongoing consolidation of the banking industry

 smart technologies and shopping experience  are gamification interfaces effective  the case of the smartstore the emergence of smart technologies is increasingly catching the attention of researchers and practitioners  especially in retailing contexts  however  empirical studies investigating the impact of technologies  design on customers  shopping experience remain limited  in response to this gap  this research analyzes the impact of gamification mechanics  a widely used tool to design smart technologies  on customers  experience  emotions and the resulting behavioral intentions  therefore  we first examine the impact of two gamification mechanics  challenge and fantasy  on customer experience and patronage intentions  then  we specifically study the case of the smartstore  a smart innovative technology used to personalize items in retailing contexts and combining these two gamification mechanics in comparison with a classical interface without any gamification mechanics  based on those two experimental studies  our findings confirm that personalizing a product through a gamified interface might have a positive impact in terms of experience during the process but also on patronage intentions  hence this research also shows that solely adding gamification mechanics such as challenge and fantasy in a smart interface is not enough to significantly enhance the quality of the perceived experience   c  2017 elsevier inc all rights reserved  
 smoking behaviour and health care costs coverage  a european cross country comparison the empirical evidence about the effect of smoking on health care cost coverage is not consistent with the expectations based on the notion of adverse selection  this evidence is mostly based on correlational studies which cannot isolate the adverse selection effect from the moral hazard effect  exploiting data from the survey of health  aging  and retirement in europe  this study uses an instrumental variable strategy to identify the causal effect of daily smoking on perceived health care cost coverage of those at age 50 or above in 12 european countries  daily smoking is instrumented by a variable indicating whether or not there is any other daily smoker in the household  a self assessment of health care cost coverage is used as the outcome measure  among those who live with a partner  72  of the sample   the result is not statistically significant which means we find no effect of smoking on perceived health care cost coverage  however  among those who live without a partner  the results show that daily smokers have lower self assessed perceived health care cost coverage  this finding replicates the same counter intuitive relationship between smoking and health insurance presented in previous studies  but in a language of causality  in addition to this  we contribute to previous studies by a cross country comparison which brings in different institutional arrangements  and by using the self assessed perceived health care cost coverage which is broader than health insurance coverage  
 social acceptance and word of mouth  how the motive to belong leads to divergent wom with strangers and friends consumers are increasingly sharing product experiences with strangers and friends online  despite the prevalence of word of mouth  wom   little is known about how and why wom differs based on whether people are talking to strangers or friends  the current article theorizes that one important motivation for wom is social acceptance  to fulfill this motivation  people form and maintain existing relationships with others  building on research in interpersonal relationships  we theorize that when communicating with strangers  people attempt to self enhance to attract strangers into forming relationships with the self  when sharing with friends  on the other hand  people attempt to connect emotionally in order to maintain existing ties  a series of seven studies provide backing for this simple yet encompassing framework  results of the current article provide insights into the motivations behind wom  synthesize prior findings  and show that people systematically share different content with strangers versus friends  the current work makes theoretical contributions to research in interpersonal communication  social influence  and wom  and holds practical implications for marketers interested in understanding consumer word of mouth  
 social and economic leader member exchange and employee creative behavior  the role of employee willingness to take risks and emotional carrying capacity in the current study we explore the relational aspect of leadership for stimulating employee creative behavior  drawing on leader member exchange  lmx  theory  we propose that the association between two distinct types of leader member exchange relationships  social  slmx  and economic  elmx   and creative behavior is mediated by employee willingness to take risks and moderated by emotional carrying capacity  based on two wave data from a sample of 147 employees  we surprisingly find only marginal support for the association between slmx and creative behavior  and  as expected  we find no support for the association between elmx and creative behavior  we do find evidence of the full mediation of willingness to take risks in these two associations  furthermore  we also find a positively significant interaction of slmx with emotional carrying capacity  ecc   but no support for the interaction of elmx with ecc in predicting employee creative behavior  we contribute to a deeper view of understanding the leadership of employee creativity as a relational process  contingent upon both employee characteristics as well as the nature of leader member exchange   c  2017 elsevier ltd  all rights reserved

 social foundation of scenario planning in this article  the authors establish that models of scenario planning typically involve a series of phases  stages  or steps that imply a sequenced  i e   linear or chronological  process  recursive models  in contrast  allow phases to repeat  thus  incorporating iteration  the authors acknowledge the concerns voiced in futures studies that while models based on practical experience are common in the literature  forming a theoretical basis for why those practices work is often considered elusive  this includes models that imply linearity and those that accommodate iterativity  with theory from science and technology studies  sts  on knowledge production  the authors explain transition from one phase to the next and iteration between and within phases based on social negotiation  to this end  the authors examine the interplay between the  scenario development  phase and the  scenario use  phase of a planning process with a non governmental organization in denmark  the upshot for facilitators is practical insight into how transition between phases and phase iteration in scenario planning can be identified  leveraged  and  thus  managed  the upshot for scholars is a related insight into why scenario planning is a kind of laboratory for futures studies wherein the future is experimented upon   c  2017 elsevier inc  all rights reserved  
 social manufacturing  when the maker movement meets interfirm production networks new business models harnessing the power of individuals have already revolutionized service industries and digital content production  in this study  we investigate whether a similar phenomenon is taking place in manufacturing industries  we start by conceptually defining two distinct forms of firm individual collaboration in manufacturing industries   1  social cloud manufacturing  in which firms outsource manufacturing to individuals  and  2  social platform manufacturing  in which firms provide manufacturing services to individuals  we then empirically investigate the nature of firm individual collaboration within these forms  focusing on the role of individuals  we find that the individuals are often makers who view their participation primarily as a hobby and are driven mainly by nonmonetary benefits  that the design process often involves both parties  and that the two forms of collaboration exploit different enabling technologies  our findings suggest that firms working with individuals can potentially reap multiple benefits  including fresh ideas  broader design support  and quick delivery times  this article contributes to an improved understanding of how firms can build potentially disruptive business models in manufacturing industries by leveraging individuals  thereby adding to the emerging stream of literature on social manufacturing   c  2017 kelley school of business  indiana university  published by elsevier inc  all rights reserved  
 social media expectations between public relations professionals and their stakeholders  results of the comgap study in spain despite the massive incorporation of social media into communication strategies  there is still much that we do not know about the type of content that stakeholders expect to receive and what conversations they wish to have with organizations  numerous studies have demonstrated that an adequate use of digital media is essential to understanding and responding to the expectations of different audiences and to be able to improve the effectiveness of communication departments  kent   saffer  2014  linke   zerfass  2013  moreno et al   2015   nonetheless  there are still relevant issues that have yet to be addressed in depth  such as the process of converting online audiences into active communicators  or what their expectations are with respect to digital interactions  this article compares the perspectives of public relations professionals against those of the general public in spain with respect to the content that organizations should offer and what activities they should carry out in the context of social media  our results show a gap in the perceptions and expectations of these two groups in both spain and across europe in order to open a discussion about whether communication professionals are effectively managing the tools at hand to create bonds and foster engagement with stakeholders  
 social media research in the industrial marketing field  review of literature and future research directions since the emergence of social media  industrial marketing academics and marketers have also been intrigued by the influence of such media on the discipline  as  social media research in the field of industrial marketing has been of increasing interest  this research attempts to review and assess the advances in social media research in the industrial marketing field  from the literature review conducted  it can be identified that some of the research areas have witnessed steady theory development increases  e g   sales and marketing communications  while others are clearly lagging behind  e g   pricing and ethics  also methodological pluralism is called for instead of more traditional methods  conceptual analysis  qualitative and survey  to establish and solve more nuanced research problems  this research provides a review of the current state of research in the field and suggests directions for future development  
 social media use in b2b sales and its impact on competitive intelligence collection and adaptive selling  examining the role of learning orientation as an enabler this paper examines the use of social media by business to business  b2b  salespeople to assist in their job functions  the authors propose that a salesperson s attitude toward social media usefulness  as well as a salesperson s learning orientation  will influence how much a salesperson uses social media to assist in day to day job tasks  additionally  the impact that the use of social media has on collecting knowledge about competitors  adapting to customers  and sales performance is considered  accordingly  a broad literature review is provided to introduce extant theory contributing to the proposed model  the practical uses of social media by salespeople will be described  and then the theoretical foundation is built  encompassing social media use  goal orientations  and adaptive selling theory  results of an empirical model are provided  followed by a discussion of theoretical and managerial implications  
 social norms and csr performance some institutional investors  e g   pensions  universities  and religious  charitable  and not for profit institutions  are exposed to social norms and public scrutiny  prior research indicates that these norm constrained institutions engage in negative screening and invest less in firms operating in  sin  industries  we examine whether social norms also motivate these institutions to engage in positive screening where they invest more in firms with better corporate social responsibility  csr  performance  and csr related activism where they promote improvements in the csr of existing investees  we find that firms with superior csr performance have greater ownership by norm constrained institutions  consistent with positive screening  and we use a natural experiment to establish causality  we also find that increases in the shareholdings of norm constrained institutions are associated with subsequent improvements in csr  consistent with activism  further  we rule out an alternative explanation for our results where the positive screening and activism are  profit driven  rather than driven by social pressure  thus  our results suggest that the influence of social norms on stock markets is more pervasive than documented in the prior literature  
 social pay reference point  external environment  and risk taking  an integrated behavioral and social psychological view compensation studies traditionally draw from behavioral agency model to explore how ceo pay influences risk taking  yet this literature has generated mixed results  integrating behavioral agency model and social comparison theory  we develop a more complete theoretical model that shed light on the equivocal findings  we introduce the concept of social pay reference point that explains risk taking in response to the underlying behavioral and social psychological mechanisms through which ceos compare and frame their pay relative to social peers  pay  in addition  we establish theoretical boundary conditions of the hypothesized baseline effects by considering the moderating effects of environmental munificence and dynamism  we test our hypotheses on 545 manufacturing firms across 2878 firm year observations spanning time period from 1994 to 2006  our hypotheses receive considerable empirical support  
 social recognition versus financial incentives  exploring the effects of creativity contingent external rewards on creative performance the present work examines the role of creativity contingent monetary versus social recognition rewards on creative performance and provides new insights into the underlying motivational processes through which these rewards affect consumer creativity  a series of five studies demonstrate that within the context of creativity contingency  monetary rewards induce a performance focus  while social recognition rewards induce a normative focus  such performance  normative  focus in turn enhances  attenuates  approach motivation to be original and hence leads to higher  lower  originality in a creative task  thus  this work not only advances the current understanding of how and why two types of widely used creativity contingent external rewards may have contrasting effects on creative performance  but it also offers important practical insights to managers who utilize reward systems in cultivating consumer creativity in their innovation platforms  
 socio technical transitions and institutional change  addressing obesity through macro social marketing obesity  climate change and poverty are some of the most serious health  environmental and social issues of the 21st century  current initiatives to address these wicked issues typically focus on the individual and community  with social marketing being a common tool  however  the effectiveness of social marketing in helping to combat these wicked issues has been mixed at best  we use the multi level perspective on socio technical transitions  mlp  to further our understanding of how macro social marketing might be used to address the wicked problem of obesity  in doing so  we further conceptualize how formal and informal institutions might contribute to the emerging field of macro social marketing  
 solving complex problems  enduring solutions through social entrepreneurship  community action  and social marketing three distinct literatures address social change  social entrepreneurship  community action research  and social marketing  while these activities have a shared goal to create social change  each orientation approaches their activities from a different perspective  the current work explores how macro social marketing efforts can benefit from alternative orientations to enhance enduring social change  social entrepreneurship highlights the importance of enduring resources and considering scalability  community action highlights the importance of obtaining legitimacy and buy in from multiple entities in the social change system  social marketing highlights the importance of an end user perspective and the application of behavioral theories to create systematic change  this work describes a case study in the kenyan education context to highlight the value of this approach  
 sovereign debt renegotiation and credit default swaps a credit default swap  cds  contract provides insurance against default  this paper incorporates the contract into a sovereign default model and demonstrates that the existence of a cds market results in lower default probability  higher debt levels  and lower financing costs for the country  uncertainty over the insurance payout when the debt is renegotiated explains why in the data  as the output declines  the cds spread becomes lower than the bond spread  finally  my results show that the 2012 cds naked ban  that decreased the levels of cds for european countries  is a welfare reducing policy   c  2017 elsevier b v  all rights reserved

 stabilization and the impact of changing patterns of energy investment more than a decade of investor state tension in which states sought to rebalance arrangements with international investors in the light of rising commodity prices is now a matter of history in the energy industry  1 some of the disputes that resulted from that fractious period continue in arbitration or litigation proceedings  and plenty of new disputes have emerged since  but those that had their roots in actions by states seeking what they saw as a fairer deal with investors benefiting from high rents are increasingly rare on the time lagged landscape of investment disputes  during this period  the interplay between investors and states took on at least one new feature that continues to play a role in the very different investment context of today  what we might call a diversification of both investors and states became evident  with an influx of new states aspiring to market their wares to international energy investors  especially in oil and gas  their novelty lies not in their statehood but rather as new entrants in the competition for investment capital characteristic of states with actual or prospective reserves of petroleum  many have rapidly evolving economies after a period of prolonged conflict  meaning that guarantees offered are particularly vulnerable to a review in the near to medium term  indeed  a number of them have been willing to commence that process of review even before production of the resource has commenced  at the same time  the kind of offer held out by such states has been particularly attractive to a new kind of energy investor  either private equity investors on the one hand  or small  explorationfocussed companies on the other  neither being likely to be motivated by the decades long view of an investment typically associated with an international oil company  ioc   for them  stability guarantees are no less important but they serve a different purpose  and are linked to an exit strategy in the foreseeable future  this combination of players new market entrants and their rather unconventionally short term approaches to the stability of long term contractual arrangements have raised questions about the adequacy of traditional guarantees of contract stability  yet  it has attracted little attention in the writings on energy disputes  in this article  i want to revisit this twin feature of recent and current energy investment and consider its significance for the notion of stabilisation in long term petroleum contracts  
 staggered boards and long term firm value  revisited this paper revisits the staggered board debate focusing on the long term association of firm value with changes in board structure  we find no evidence that staggered board changes are negatively related to firm value  however  we find a positive relation for firms engaged in innovation and where stakeholder relationships matter more  this suggests that staggered boards promote value creation for some firms by committing the firm to undertaking long term projects and bonding it to the relationship specific investments of its stakeholders  our results are robust to matching procedures and an exogenous change in massachusetts corporate law that mandated staggered boards   c  2017 elsevier b v  all rights reserved  
 stakeholder orientation and acquisition performance research summary  in this article  we study how a firm s stakeholder orientation affects the performance of its corporate acquisitions  we depart from prior literature and suggest that orientations toward employees  customers  suppliers  and local communities will affect long term acquisition performance both directly and through its interactions with process characteristics  such as preacquisition relatedness and postacquisition integration  analyses of data on a sample of 1884 acquisitions show overall a positive association between acquirers  stakeholder orientation and acquisition performance  in addition  we find support for a positive moderation of business relatedness on the performance impacts of stakeholder orientation  structural integration has a similarly positive moderation effect only for some of the stakeholder categories managerial summary  does collaboration with stakeholders during an acquisition pay off in terms of performance  the results of this research show that it is worth engaging stakeholders during the m a process  but that the efficacy of involvement practices may depend on the type of stakeholders and the characteristics of the acquisition  while acquiring firms that take account of suppliers and local communities consistently overperform in their acquisitions  the inclusion of employees might be not beneficial  and even harmful  when the target firm operates in a dissimilar business or when managers do not plan to maintain it as a separate entity  copyright  c  2017 john wiley   sons  ltd  
 state dependent variations in the expected illiquidity premium recent evidence on state dependent variations in market liquidity suggests strong variations in the illiquidity premium across economic states  adopting a two state markov switching model  we find that  while illiquid stocks are affected more by economic conditions than liquid ones are during recessions  the differences in expected returns are relatively small during expansions  therefore  the expected illiquidity premium displays strong state dependent variations that are countercyclical  we show that the state of a high illiquidity premium is closely associated with periods of real economic recessions  market declines  and high volatility  which coincides with major events of liquidity dry up and high liquidity commonality

 sticky dividends  a new explanation this study proposes a generalized partial adjustment model of dividends in which managers set target dividends based on adaptively formed earnings prospects  we show that firms adjust dividends to their target payouts much faster than previously documented  when managers form future earnings expectations based on a longer time series of earnings  target dividends tend to become more stable  thus  actual dividends tend to be more in line with the targets  driving up the speed of adjustment  our model offers an insight that sticky dividends could be a consequence of managers  attempts to match dividend payouts with the smooth targets   c  2017 elsevier inc  all rights reserved  
 stock market anomalies  market efficiency and the adaptive market hypothesis  evidence from islamic stock indices despite the development and growth of islamic finance  the academic literature on the subject  while increasing  has so far provided no information on the calendar anomalies in islamic stock indices  therefore  using stochastic dominance  sd  and mean variance  mv  analyses  this paper examines the adaptive market hypothesis  amh  through three well known calendar anomalies in eight dow jones islamic indices  djii  from 1996 to 2015 and over five subsamples  the results of sd and mv show that varying of calendar anomalies over time support the amh in islamic stock indices  the most vital finding is that the islamic indices achieved greater efficiency over time  particularly during the recent financial crisis  when their prevalence greatly increased  thus  the results suggest that the amh offers a better explanation of the behavior of calendar anomalies than the efficient market hypothesis   c  2017 elsevier b v  all rights reserved  
 stock market listing and the use of trade credit  evidence from public and private firms this paper examines differences in the use of trade credit by publicly listed firms and their privately held counterparts  we show that public firms maintain a significantly lower level of trade credit than private firms  this finding is consistent with the argument that public firms rely less on supplier financing because of their greater access to cheaper and less risky sources of external capital  we further find that while public and private firms actively seek to adjust toward their optimal trade credit levels  the former firms experience faster adjustment the recent financial crisis had differential effects on the trade credit ratios of public and private firms   c  2017 elsevier b v  all rights reserved

 strategic responses to imposed innovation projects  the case of carbon capture and storage in the alberta oil sands industry today s  activist  attitudes and strong power of non market stakeholders  such as government agencies  non governmental organizations  labor unions  have triggered the phenomenon of imposed innovation projects  these are investment projects carried out by profit seeking firms primarily in response to the demands of influential non market stakeholders  such projects are supposedly instrumental to the emergence of new  socially beneficial products and production processes  we use a stakeholder management perspective to analyze the case study of a set of salient imposed innovation projects in the realm of carbon capture and storage  ccs  technology  pursued in the 2011 2014 period by a number of energy companies in western canada  we describe the peculiarities of these projects and reveal the scope and drivers of firm level actions in response to the pressure to pursue imposed innovations  the findings reveal a spectrum of strategic responses to imposed innovation pressures  with varying degrees of cooperation with other economic actors  and varying levels of engagement to tailor the imposed innovation to the firm s technological profile  we develop a set of propositions on the performance implications for firms implementing imposed innovation projects  the paper concludes with recommendations for policy makers concerned with the improved diffusion and effectiveness of such projects   c  2017 elsevier ltd  all rights reserved

 strong reciprocity in consumer boycotts boycotts are among the most frequent forms of consumer expression against unethical or egregious acts by firms  most current research explains consumers  decisions to participate in a boycott using a universal cost benefit model that mixes instrumental and expressive motives  to date  no conceptual framework accounts for the distinct behavioral motives for boycotting though  this article focuses on motivational heterogeneity among consumers  by distinguishing two stable behavioral models a self regarding type and a strongly reciprocal type we introduce the notion of strong reciprocity to the boycott literature  we argue that the presence of strongly reciprocal consumers can enhance boycott success  first  in interactions with the target firm  strongly reciprocal consumers perceive higher levels of egregiousness and are more willing to engage in boycotting behavior  even in unfavorable strategic conditions  which provides a stable basis for boycotting  second  in interactions with self regarding consumers  strongly reciprocal consumers are willing to sanction those others  according to whether they participate in the boycott  which increases overall participation in and the likelihood of success of a consumer boycott  these findings have implications for further research  as well as for firms  nongovernmental organizations  and boycotters

 sufficiency in energy scenario studies  taking the potential benefits of lifestyle changes into account in recent years  a number of energy scenario studies which aim to advise policy makers on appropriate energy policy measures have been developed  these studies highlight changes required to achieve a future energy system that is in line with public policy goals such as reduced greenhouse gas emissions and an affordable energy supply  we argue that behavioural changes towards energy sufficient lifestyles have considerable potential to contribute to public policy goals and may even be indispensable for achieving some of these goals  this potential should  therefore  be reflected in scenario studies aiming to provide comprehensive advice to policy makers  we analyse the role that energy sufficient lifestyles play in prominent recent global energy scenario studies and find that these studies largely ignore the potential of possible behavioural changes towards energy sufficient lifestyles  we also describe how such changes have been considered in several other scenario studies  in order to derive recommendations for the future development of global energy scenarios  we conclude that the inclusion of lifestyle changes in energy scenarios is both possible and useful  based on our findings  we present some general advice for energy scenario developers on how to better integrate sufficiency into future energy scenario studies in a quantitative manner   c  2016 the authors  published by elsevier inc

 sustainability and organizational behavior  a micro foundational perspective organizational behavior is a well established academic field comprising a comprehensive and wide range of extant literature  in contrast  sustainability and micro foundational literature constitute significant but nevertheless more relatively recent emergent bodies of work with each having developed particular predilections in the manner in which they are cast and discussed  there is scope  therefore  to bring to bear a range of organizational behavioral insights in conjunction with these areas thereby creating a fusion that surfaces the drivers and antecedents that operate and play out in the dynamic between these domains  the mechanism employed to do this is through the development of a special issue of papers  drawing on a range of methodological approaches and sectorial perspectives  this is important and has the aim of generating fresh insights and challenging conventional ways of viewing the behavioral dimensions of sustainability and especially through a micro foundational lens  the analyses in special issue underline and demonstrate the value of engaging a range of national contexts  sectorial settings  and historical and contemporaneous perspectives that shed novel light on the confluences of sustainability  organizational behavior  and micro foundations  special issue also suggests future directions that subsequent research may take in these arenas  
 sustainability of the sharing economy in question  when second hand peer to peer platforms stimulate indulgent consumption the sharing economy has recently gained momentum among managers  public policy tinkers and academics as a great opportunity to boost sustainable consumption through sharing or selling durables or semi durables  the present paper contributes to this debate by investigating the propensity of consumers to give in to temptation on second hand peer to peer  p2p  platforms  which provide a favorable context for self licensing behaviors  a survey was conducted in 2015 amongst 541 active buyers on the french p2p platform leboncoin  equivalent of us craigslist  addressing questions relative to their buying activities in the previous year  the results show that materialistic and environmentally conscious consumers are more likely  than consumers who are not materialistic and environmentally conscious  to be tempted in the context of second hand p2p platforms as these offer justifications that help reduce consumption related cognitive dissonance  this finding corroborates the counterproductive role of collaborative consumption for sustainability in certain conditions  theoretically  the research contributes to further developing the emerging self licensing theory in the context of second hand p2p platforms and understanding impulse buying on this new web interface   c  2017 elsevier inc  all rights reserved

 switching behaviour as a function of number of options  how much is too much for consumer choice decisions  the number of alternatives for consumers in almost all purchase situations is increasing at an extremely rapid pace  although more choices may have many benefits to the consumers  recent studies on choice overload have found that choosing from large alternatives may lead to negative consequences  majority of the choice overload research has compared only two groups of small versus large assortment size  in extant literature  there is no clarity as to what are small and large assortment sizes  assortment size used as small in one study has been used as large in some other studies  small assortment size varied from 2 to 60 choices and large assortment size from 3 to 300 choices in past studies  and the presence of choice overload has been reported at completely different levels of assortment sizes  this study has used an array of six choice sets from 6 to 36 options as compared to just two groups of small versus large assortment  switching likelihood of consumers was used to capture the choice overload effect in this study  the probability of consumers switching their earlier choice was plotted as a function of number of options using binary logistic regression  results showed that probability of switching was almost a linearly increasing function of assortment size from 6 to 36 options  the graph of predicted probabilities from 2 to 300 options showed a sharp increase in switching behaviour initially and subsequent flattening of the curve when options became very large  
 systemic risk  a new trade off for monetary policy  we introduce time varying systemic risk  a la he and krishnamurthy  2014  in an otherwise standard new keynesian model to study whether simple leaning against the wind interest rate rules can reduce systemic risk and improve welfare  we find that while financial sector leverage contains additional information about the state of the economy that is not captured in inflation and output leaning against financial variables can only marginally improve welfare because rules are detrimental in the presence of falling asset prices  an optimal macroprudential policy  similar to a counter cyclical capital requirement  can eliminate systemic risk raising welfare by about 1 5   also  a surprise monetary policy tightening does not necessarily reduce systemic risk  especially during bad times  finally  a volatility paradox a la brunnermeier and sannikov  2014  arises when monetary policy tries to excessively stabilize output   c  2017 elsevier b v  all rights reserved  
 taoist leadership and employee green behaviour  a cultural and philosophical microfoundation of sustainability existing research shows that leadership behaviours can influence the proenvironment beliefs of employees and their green behaviours  however  the mechanisms that nurture the proenvironment attitudes of employees remain unclear  by juxtaposing taoist philosophy and aldo leopold s land ethic  this paper explores how the former can theoretically advance the latter from a cultural and philosophical microfoundational perspective  taoism  which treats human beings and the natural environment as components of an integral oneness  has important implications for both taoist leadership behaviours and the management of sustainability  we posit that the attributions of taoist leadershiprejection of domination  reverse thinking  and selflessnesscan nurture employee proenvironment attitudes  using the narratives of chinese leaders and employees  our research empirically shows that the proenvironment attitudes and green behaviours of employees can be nurtured through taoist leadership  our paper contributes the field of sustainability management by suggesting taoism as a cultural and philosophical microfoundation for sustainability  
 tax driven wealth chains  a multiple case study of tax avoidance in the finnish mining sector this paper contributes to recent discussions of corporate tax avoidance and global wealth chains  drawing on multiple case studies  we outline the key strategies adopted by finnish mining companies as they seek to lower their tax burden  after screening the accounts of the companies mining metallic ores in finland  we provide an in depth analysis of the tax avoidance arrangements at three of these mines  the mines were operated by two canadian enterprises that utilized seven different tax avoidance arrangements  the multiple case study approach adopted in this paper is helpful in developing both quantitative and qualitative tax avoidance research  since our findings highlight major deficiencies of datasets commonly used in the dominant quantitative tax avoidance research  our qualitative approach helps tackle some of the limitations imposed on tax researchers as a result of the considerable secrecy surrounding tax matters  in particular  we argue that the existing tax avoidance research has focused too much on statutory corporate income tax rates even though today  tax minimization relies mostly on specific tax incentives and other loopholes in tax laws  we argue that the arrangements we describe mirror a wider phenomenon where multinational enterprises exert societal power commonly associated with sovereign states  crossing the disciplinary boundaries of accounting  political economy and tax law  we also contribute to the emerging research agenda on global wealth chains  we call for more attention to the intersections between accounting and tax law for understanding how enterprises can separate their value chains from the intra firm flows of wealth   c  2017 the authors  published by elsevier ltd  
 technical change and income inequality in china the purpose of this paper was to explore the inequality technical change relationship  different from earlier studies  we aim to gauge the impact of technical change on the overall inequality  not just a particular component of inequality  this is achieved by establishing that the labour share of income is negatively correlated with overall inequality as indicated by the popular gini coefficient and by modelling the labour share of income as a function of technical change  the empirical model of labour share of income is estimated using 1978 2012 provincial panel data from china  the main estimation results show that technical change in china had been mostly capital biased  it contributed to the successive reductions in china s labour share of income and thus rapid rises in income inequality  
 technology sourcing for website personalization and social media marketing  a study of e retailing industry extant streams of literature on technology sourcing  website personalization and social media marketing are distinct from one another and hence are unable to explain the impact of technology sourcing for website personalization and social media marketing on sales  to address this gap  we use various concepts such as efficiency  adaptability  risks of dependency  lack of quality control  asset specificity and tacit knowledge to hypothesize the direct effect of technology sourcing on sales as well as the indirect effect through social media performance  using survey data from 105 u s  e retailers  we show that e retailers using mixed technology sourcing for website personalization have greater sales than e retailers that use either internally or externally developed technology  on the contrary  e retailers selecting externally developed technology for social media marketing have greater sales than e retailers that offer social media marketing that uses either internally developed technology or mixed technology sourcing  
 technology transfers and organization  the english east india company and the transfer of piedmontese silk reeling technology to bengal  1750s 1790s this article addresses two questions  why do firms centralize  and what determines the success and failure of technology transfers  first  it argues that centralization decreases the costs of technology transfers  especially if knowledge is tacit  by reducing transaction costs  second  it argues that an important factor for the success of a technology transfer is the capacity of a firm to mitigate agency problems  the english east india company  eeic  is mostly studied as a trading body  this article analyzes the company s attempt to become a producer of raw silk in bengal  in order to improve the quality of bengal raw silk and thus increase the silk s trading potential  it decided to apply piedmontese reeling technologies that relied on a centralized system of production  which significantly decreased the transmission costs of the technology transfer and was thus the key for its success  however  because the eeic s management system involved in silk manufacturing was not innovated  the transfer s effectiveness was diminished  
 technology driven service strategy advancements in technology are radically transforming service  and increasingly providing the underlying basis for service strategy  in this paper  we develop a typology and positioning map for service strategy  in the context of rapid technological change  and outline the process for firms to position or reposition their service strategies  which strategy to choose is based on the degree to which customer demand is heterogeneous  and the degree to which potential customer lifetime value varies across customers  this results in four strategies  the mcservice strategy that is standardized and transactional  the relational service strategy that is standardized and relational  the customized transaction strategy that is personalized and transactional  and the adaptive personalization strategy that is personalized and relational  we provide firms a roadmap for identifying a  sweet spot  strategy in relation to a segment s realized or potential customer lifetime value  combined with the firm s technological capabilities  because technological capabilities inevitably advance  firms will tend to move from standardized to personalized and from transactional to relational over time  implying that firms should be alert to technological opportunities to personalize their relationships with customers  our strategic framework also produces a useful bridge from marketing practice to the conceptual evolution of the service literature  showing how the historical trends toward continuing customer relationships and co productive personalization should drive strategic thinking in service  
 temporal product bundling with myopic and strategic consumers  manifestations and relative effectiveness bundling in this era of ecommerce and high technology is a potent and widespread selling tool  the literature has focused on three static bundling strategies under which the products are sold separately  pure components or pc  or only in a bundled form  pure bundling or pb  or both  mixed bundling or mb   in a generalization  and motivated by real world examples  this paper examines the relative effectiveness of temporal bundling  we consider a firm that sells to a market of myopic and strategic consumers  and a selling season consisting of two stages  we compare four strategies   pc pc  i e   pure components in each of two stages   pb pb  pb pc and pc pb   relative to mb  our results show that pb pb maximizes profits under low marginal costs  pc pc prevails under high marginal costs given a large proportion of myopic consumers  and pb pc is profit maximizing under moderate marginal costs when most consumers are strategic  these temporal strategies dominate mb except when the market is comprised entirely of strategic consumers  finally  while temporal mixed bundling   mb mb   is weakly superior to other temporal strategies  the latter are much easier to implement  as shown by real world uses  and suffice to capture most of the profits  related interesting pricing implications are discussed  three extensions to the main model are also proposed

 the assessment of the united states quantitative easing policy  evidence from global stock markets this study assesses the performance of the quantitative easing policy implemented by the united states  us  on the stock markets with a framework of structure break  the empirical results show that the business cycle or the value of gross domestic production has a negative impact on the stock markets for most of the countries even if both gross domestic production and many stock prices are procyclical  moreover  the purchases of us treasury securities and mortgage backed securities respectively affect the stock markets synchronously and laggardly  notably  they both have a positive impact on the stock markets during the study period  finally  during the after structure break period  the volatility can be easily affected by bad news  and the investors have the lower profit or even the greater loss and bear the greater risk and variation of risk owing to the global financial crisis caused by the us  on the basis of the above findings  some policy implications are offered in this study  
 the association between earnings forecast in ipos prospectuses and earnings management  an empirical analysis this paper examines the level of earnings management for large ipos that provide earnings forecasts and those that do not provide forecasts in the ipo prospectus  using a sample f 368 ipo firms listed on the london stock exchange between 1985 and 2012  we find that the level of earnings management is lower for ipos that provided earnings forecasts  than for those which did not provide a forecast  this evidence is robust  controlling for endogeneity and sample selection  further tests reveal that ipos that provide forecasts outperform their counterparts in the long run  using various long term performance measures  overall  our results suggest that earnings forecasts at the time of listing convey useful information to investors on the quality of the company listing in the market   c  2017 elsevier b v  all rights reserved  
 the behaviour of smes  capital structure determinants in different macroeconomic states the recent global financial crisis has triggered questions in the scientific area of capital structure dynamic determination regarding how  quickly  companies tend to adjust their capital structure to their long term targets  in different macroeconomic states  we broaden the scope of the debate by focusing on smes and by discussing the relative importance of firm specific and macroeconomic variables  when macroeconomic conditions change  based on a partial adjustment model  we find that short term and long term debt ratios follow different patterns regarding their adjustment speeds  the adjustment speed for long term debt slows down during the crisis  while the respective of the short term debt is not affected  we also find clear differentiations of the effects and the contribution of the firm specific and the macroeconomic variables between short term debt and long term debt ratios  when macroeconomic states change  we thus conclude that the nature and maturity of borrowing affect the persistence and endurance of the relationship between determinants and borrowing  across different macroeconomic states   c  2017 elsevier b v  all rights reserved  
 the benefit of becoming friends  complaining after service failures leads customers with strong ties to increase loyalty service firms spend considerable resources soliciting complaints to initiate recovery efforts and improve their offerings  however  managers may be overlooking the fact that complaints serve an equally important role in engendering loyalty  the authors demonstrate that the strength of social ties between customers and service providers influences the degree to which complaining drives loyalty  paradoxically  while strongly tied customers fear that complaining threatens their ties with the provider  when they are encouraged to complain  their loyalty increases because offering feedback serves as an effective way to preserve social ties  conversely  for weakly tied customers  complaining has no effect on loyalty  furthermore  complaints are more effective in driving loyalty for strongly tied customers when the feedback is directed toward the provider who failed  rather than to an entity external to the failure  finally  when providers signal an authentic openness to feedback  strongly tied customers are more loyal after complaining  whereas authenticity does little to engender loyalty for weakly tied customers who complain  the value of complaints in driving loyalty is promising both for customers who perceive a strong tie to a particular provider within the firm and  more generally  in service industries wherein strong ties naturally occur  
 the benefit of life insurance contracts with capped index participation when stock prices are subject to jump risk we analyze the benefit to the insured of newly traded  innovative life insurance contracts  on a sequence of yearly reference days  the insured can choose between a guaranteed return  linked to the insurer s asset result  and a capped index participation  the cap is adjusted at the beginning of each year such that both alternatives have the same value and the option to select is costless  product structuring condition   we point out that this condition cannot always be met  if the guaranteed return exceeds the upper bound of the capped index participation  the insurer can make a side profit  we show that a rather low insurance result also implies a rather low stock exposure  even if the insured opts for the index participation  concerning the impact of the index dynamics  we emphasize that it is important to distinguish between jump and diffusion risk because the pricing of jump risk has an impact on cap rates that can be offered to an insured  finally  we show that the optimal decision strategy of a crra investor implies an index selection even if it is unfairly priced such that the insurer indeed makes a side profit  
 the best of all possible worlds  unraveling target price optimism using analysts  scenario based valuations we document that the relative placement of analysts  target price within their subjective distribution of scenario based valuations for the covered firm  i e   tilt  is informative to investors  when analysts forecast price appreciation  tilt incrementally predicts ex post valuation errors and realized returns  the predictive value of tilt disappears when analysts forecast price declines  in additional analyses  we find that tilt appears to reflect an optimistic bias in target price forecasts as opposed to information about asymmetric state contingent risk payoffs  finally  we document that investors can use estimates of implied tilt based on observable firm characteristics to distinguish between investments with equally optimistic target price forecasts  yet lacking scenario based information  
 the case for herding is stronger than you think in this paper  we challenge the often implemented herding measure by chang et al   2000   they regress the cross sectional absolute deviation of returns on the absolute and squared excess market return  a coefficient on the squared excess market return significantly smaller than zero is interpreted as evidence for herding  however  we show that the true coefficient is positive under the null hypothesis of no herding  hence  their test is biased against finding evidence in favour of herding  empirical examinations for the s p 500 and the eurostoxx 50 confirm the misleading implications of chang  cheng and khorana s measure  while our modified test provides clear cut evidence for herding behaviour   c  2017 elsevier b v  all rights reserved  
 the common good of the firm and humanistic management  conscious capitalism and economy of communion businesses have long been admonished for being unduly focused on the pursuit of profit  however  there are some organizations whose purpose is not exclusively economic to the extent that they seek to constitute common good  building on christian ethics as a starting point  our article shows how the pursuit of the common good of the firm can serve as a guide for humanistic management  it provides two principles that humanistic management can attempt to implement  first  that community good is a condition for the realization of personal good  and second  that community good can only be promoted if it is oriented towards personal good  to better understand which community good can favor personal good and how it can be achieved  we examine two recent humanistic movements conscious capitalism and economy of communion that strive to participate in the common good  from the analysis of these two movements  we identify a shared managerial willingness to adopt the two principles  moreover  we also reveal that conscious capitalism and economy of communion present different ways of linking community good and personal good  and therefore  different means exist for firms to participate in the common good

 the danger of not listening to firms  government responsiveness and the goal of regulatory compliance firms in emerging economies exhibit dangerously low rates of compliance with government regulations aimed at protecting society from the negative externalities of their operations  this study builds on individual level theories from organizational behavior  procedural justice  and political science  deliberative democracy  to develop new firm level theory on the mechanism by which a firm is more likely to comply with a regulation after participating in its design by government  we hypothesize and find supporting evidence that such participation increases the likelihood of compliance by positively shaping the firm s view of government legitimacy  but only if the firm views government as responsive to its input  without this responsiveness  regulatory compliance is even less likely than if the firm did not participate at all  our empirical work is novel in its focus on the political activities of firms not only within the authoritarian ruled emerging economy context of vietnam  but also through study of a highly representative sample dominated by small and medium sized enterprises  we discuss how our work contributes to nonmarket strategy literatures on corporate social responsibility  self regulation  and corporate political activity  as well as its implications for public policy

 the degree of technological innovation  a demand heterogeneity perspective a perennial question posed by work in the technology management domain is whether a firm should deploy a technology more advanced than its current one  while past research has provided us with a better understanding of the firm level decision to invest in new technology  the degree of this advancement  relative to the technology inherent in existing company product offerings  remains a nascent phenomenon that the field has not fully addressed  data on global flat panel display makers from 1995 through 2011 are analyzed to understand how competitive standing in distinct intra industry technology segments affects a firm s degree of technological innovation  we adopt a demand heterogeneity perspective to develop hypotheses relating the degree to which more advanced technology is deployed to a firm s competitive share of a particular segment  our findings demonstrate how segment share  a more refined unit of analysis than overall market share  encourages a firm to advance its technology and how intra segment competition moderates this direct effect  the current study provides evidence that demand heterogeneity is operative not only at different stages of the technology life cycle  but also in different segments populated by users with divergent technological requirements  
 the determinants of buyout returns  does transaction strategy matter  using an original dataset of fully monetized lbos initiated from 1990 to 2006  we examine the emergence of an entrepreneurial transaction strategy focused on revenue growth and its incidence relative to more  classic  strategies focused on operating efficiencies  we additionally show how the conventional focus on returns measured at an ipo or acquisition frequently overstates actual realized returns to sponsors  using this return data  we evaluate how  classic  and  entrepreneurial  strategies are associated with sponsors  equity returns  among successful lbos  lbos that enhance operating efficiencies produce the highest  exit  returns  however  lbo sponsors commonly fail to monetize these returns due to delays associated with liquidating portfolio positions  in contrast  lbos that focus on growing revenues are associated with higher fully realized equity returns  suggesting more sustainable value creation for sponsors and their investors   c  2017 elsevier b v  all rights reserved  
 the determinants of financial fraud in chinese firms  does corporate governance as an institutional innovation matter  china has adopted a gradual and experimental approach to the political and economic reform process since the late 1970s  the reforms continue to this day and have produced a unique corporate governance structure in china which can be viewed as an institutional innovation  this study deals with social changes and institutional innovations in china  we provide direct evidence on the association of corporate governance and financial fraud using a sample of chinese listed firms  differing from previous studies that focused on western firms  we find that ownership structure  dual ceo chairman of the directorate status  external auditors and regulators  requirements contribute to the likelihood of financial fraud  specifically  when firms have less concentrated ownership  dual ceo chairman of the directorate status and shorter audit service tenures  as well as when they experience greater regulation pressure  they tend to engage in financial fraud  however  we do not find evidence that the percentage of independent directors in the directorate  the presence of an audit committee or the proportion of shares owned by the supervisory board members play a role in deterring financial fraud  the evidence in this study offers insights into whether corporate governance is effective in the control of financial fraud in china  
 the determinants of portfolio investment in offshore financial centers an offshore financial center  ofc  is generally defined as a jurisdiction in which the financial sector is disproportionately larger than the domestic economy  we examine what national level push factors determine a country s investment in ofcs using a panel data set covering 78 source countries investing in over 200 foreign jurisdictions  ofcs are defined using an existing method based on institutional characteristics and fiscal policies as well as with a novel data driven method based on actual financial positions relative to gdp  we find that ofc investment is driven by various aspects of low profitability in the source country  source country factors such as inefficient labor markets  weak infrastructure  and competitive markets drive investments toward ofcs  these factors have an even larger impact on ofc investment than corporate tax rates in the source country  this suggests that a country seeking to reduce utilization of ofc s should focus on policies like improving domestic infrastructure and the efficiency of labor markets   c  2017 published by elsevier inc

 the differential impact of new product development  make buy  choices on immediate and future product quality  insights from the automobile industry this article examines the impact of new product development  npd   make buy  choices on product quality using data from the automobile industry  although the business press has lamented that npd outsourcing compromises product quality  there is no systematic evidence to support or refute this assertion  against this backdrop  this study tests a contingency model of the impact of npd make buy decisions on immediate and future product quality  the hypotheses are tested using data on npd make buy choices of 173 models of 12 automobile firms in the united states between 2007 and 2014  the authors find that whereas npd buy has a more positive impact on immediate product quality  npd make has a more positive impact on future product quality  furthermore  the immediate product quality impact of npd buy is stronger when  1  technologies are more complex and  2  firm npd capability is higher  in contrast  the future product quality impact of npd make is stronger when  1  there is postlaunch adverse feedback and  2  firm npd capability is higher  the study highlights the complex trade offs associated with npd make buy decisions and offers valuable insights on how firms could manage these decisions  
 the diffusion of voluntary environmental programs  the case of iso 14001 in korea  1996 2011 this paper examines the adoption of iso 14001  which is known as the most famous voluntary environmental program  the data of this paper pertain to korean  throughout this paper  korea refers to the republic of korea  south korea   firms in manufacturing industries from 1996 to 2011  event history modeling to examine firms  adoption of iso 14001 finds that both resource based factors and institutional factors have influenced the diffusion of iso 14001 in korea  by exploring time related effects  i also find that while resource based factors are important in the early periods of the diffusion  institutional factors become important in the later periods of the diffusion  this confirms the findings of previous studies that a firm s motivation to adopt organizational policies varies according to different diffusion periods  the paper concludes with a brief discussion of what this study tells us about the institutional context of iso 14001 in korea and asia more broadly  
 the downside of asset screening for market liquidity this paper explores the tension between asset quality and market liquidity  i model an originator who screens assets whose cash flows are later sold in secondary markets  screening improves asset quality but gives rise to asymmetric information  hindering trade of the asset cash flows  in the optimal mechanism  second best   costly retention of cash flows is essential to implement asset screening  market allocations can feature too much or too little screening relative to second best  where too much screening generates inefficiently illiquid markets  furthermore  the economy is prone to multiple equilibria  the optimal mechanism is decentralized with two tools  retention rules and transfers  
 the drivers of foreign bank lending in central and eastern europe  the roles of parent  subsidiary and host market traits we analyze the relative roles of subsidiary and parent banking group traits in driving foreign banks  lending patterns in the central and eastern european  cee  region before and during the crisis  we use a bank level dataset on western european banking groups and their cee subsidiaries over the 2002 2013 period  we find that lower capital to asset ratios and higher non performing loans  npl  ratios at either the subsidiary or the parent bank level significantly lowered subsidiary lending growth before and during the crisis  the onset of the crisis not only lowered subsidiary lending growth in the cee countries  but also has altered the relationship between balance sheet conditions and lending growth  however  we also find strong evidence that this crisis effect is significantly less pronounced for subsidiaries participating in the vienna initiative  our results  policy implications include purging banks of npls  enhanced regulatory coordination and the inclusion of parent bank traits in countercyclical capital buffer calculations  published by elsevier ltd  
 the dynamic role of small  and medium sized multinationals in global production networks  norwegian maritime firms in the greater shanghai region in china this article examines the role of small  and medium sized multinational enterprises  mnes  in the dynamic development of global production networks  gpns  in the maritime industry  it studies the dynamism between subsidiaries of norwegian maritime firms and regional actors and institutions in the greater shanghai region of china from the perspectives of the subsidiaries  it argues that strategic coupling  recoupling and decoupling are partly the results of regional selection mechanisms  however  in the cases where the subsidiaries are embedded within the host region  the strategies and behaviour of mnes are of decisive importance for the dynamic development of gpns

 the effect of board of directors on r d intensity  board tenure and multiple directorships taking a combination between agency theory and resource dependence theory  we point out that directors  capital may have an effect on r d strategies  a sample of both high tech and low tech industries for the period 2007 2011 is used  the results indicate that  regardless of the type of industry and the specific expertise on r d intensive companies  board members with multiple directorships influence r d corporate strategies  the resources acquired by directors through their experience and connections positively influence r d intensity  but only if directors can carry out their monitoring activity adequately  this evidence implies a step forward in the understanding of the role of board of directors in corporate strategy  thus having significant implications for academics  companies and regulators  which are both theoretical and practical  
 the effect of cognitive moral development on honesty in managerial reporting this study examines whether truth telling in the form of honest reporting is associated with cognitive moral development  conventional agency theory assumes that people are self interested and willing to tell a lie to increase their personal payoffs  while recent empirical evidence shows that some people give up monetary rewards to tell the truth  e g   evans et al   account rev 76  537 559  2001   the social psychology literature suggests that cognitive moral development influences individuals  ethical decisions  we carried out an experiment whereby participants submitted managerial reports in which truth telling decreased their monetary payoff  despite the fact that their decisions were not subject to monitoring  auditing  or reputation effects  some participants reported honestly or partially honestly  we find the relationship between honest reporting and cognitive moral development to be both positive and linear  compared with those at lower stages of cognitive moral development  participants at higher stages of cognitive moral development were more likely to submit an honest report and give up potential monetary gains from lying  we further examine the economic impact of honest reporting on the firm s profit  with the assumption of self interest and profit maximization  antle and eppen  manag sci 31  163 174  1985  suggest that a contract with a hurdle rate feature reduces managers  information rent  we find that in comparison with the expected outcome of a hurdle contract  the firm can yield higher profits with a trust contract by hiring managers with a p score higher than 16 67

 the effect of industry co location on analysts  information acquisition costs we examine how the co location of firms in the same industry affects analysts  cost of gathering and processing information  we find that when the firms in an analyst s portfolio are located farther away from other firms in the same industry  the analyst s portfolio size is smaller and average forecast accuracy is lower  we further find that the additional costs that analysts incur to follow distant firms are amplified when earnings are more difficult to forecast  last  we provide some evidence that managers are more knowledgeable about other firms in the same geographic area  specifically  managers are more likely to reference firms in their industry that are geographically closer during conference calls  this paper provides additional evidence that the co location of firms in the same industry not only affects operating and strategic decisions  as documented in the existing literature   but also analysts  costs of gathering and analyzing information about the firm  
 the effect of loyalty program expiration policy on consumer behavior although loyalty programs can help divert costs to the future by using delayed rewards  unredeemed program currency can become significant liability for the firm  to alleviate this concern  many programs have introduced a point expiration date or have shortened their expiration time horizon  this issue of point expiration has received scant attention in the literature  contrary to an intuitive negative effect one would expect from a more stringent expiration policy  our real life data and lab experiment demonstrated that a finite expiration policy can affect purchases positively but only for consumers who have the flexibility to adapt their behavior to such a policy  we identified usage level and engagement in multi store shopping as two sources contributing to flexibility  overall  our findings point to a need to understand one s customer base to design the optimal point expiration policy and program communication  
 the effect of non trading days on volatility forecasts in equity markets weekends and holidays lead to gaps in daily financial data  standard models ignore these irregularities  because this issue is particularly important for persistent time series  we focus on volatility modelling  specifically modelling of realized volatility  we suggest a simple way of adjusting volatility models  which we illustrate on an ar 1  model and the har model of corsi  2009   we investigate daily series of realized volatilities for 21 equity indices around the world  covering more than 15 years  and we find that our extension improves the volatility models both in sample and out of sample  for har models and for consecutive trading days  the mean squared error decreased by 2 34  in average and for the qlike loss function by 1 41    c  2017 elsevier inc  all rights reserved  
 the effect of organizational responses to service failures on customer satisfaction perception this paper explores how organizational responses to service failures affect perceived justice and recovery satisfaction using responses from 410 customers who experienced service failures in hong kong  the results indicated that the acknowledgement of and prompt action to fix service failures were positively linked to perceived justice  which in turn affects recovery satisfaction  moreover  customer relation orientation moderated the relationship between acknowledgement of service failure and justice perceptions of service recovery  while customer task orientation moderated the relationship between prompt action for service recovery and justice perceptions of that recovery  
 the effect of payday lending restrictions on liquor sales we exploit a change in lending laws to estimate the causal effect of restricting access to payday loans on liquor sales  leveraging lender  and liquor store level data  we find that the changes reduce sales  with the largest decreases at stores located nearest to payday lenders  by focusing on states with state run liquor monopolies  we account for endogenous supply side variables that are typically unobserved  further analysis of consumer level data indicates that the lending restrictions reduce alcohol expenditures without affecting total household spending  this is consistent with a distinct relationship between payday lending access and alcohol purchases  and suggests that present biased motivations underlie some loan use  the finding is significant because it shows that payday loan access is associated with unproductive borrowing  and directly links payday loan access to public health issues   c  2017 elsevier b v  all rights reserved  
 the effect of relationships with government owned banks on cash flow constraints  evidence from india we examine the effect of maintaining exclusive relationships with government owned banks  gobs  on real investment by publicly traded companies in india  firms that maintain such exclusive relationships have an investment cash flow sensitivity that is almost 30  lower relative to other firms  gob relationships also increase sensitivity of investment to tobin s q exclusive relationships with private banks increase cash flow sensitivity while exclusive relationships with foreign banks have no impact the lower investment cash flow sensitivity by firms with exclusive gob relationships is not the result of cherry picking of less constrained firms by gobs  rather  firms with exclusive gob relationships are in worse financial condition relative to other firms   thus  gobs appear to be doing reverse of cherry picking  surprisingly  the results are driven by the large firms which benefit from gob relationship and not the smaller firms which are the intended beneficiaries of government directed credit programs   c  2017 published by elsevier b v  
 the effect of the growth in labor hours per worker on future stock returns  hiring  and profitability high growth rate of labor hours per worker signals low future stock returns and high future hiring rate  as labor hours are substituted for hiring  hiring becomes less responsive to future discount rate  the growth rate of the number of labor hours per worker does not appear to be related to future profitability  our findings are largely consistent with a dynamic labor hours asset pricing model that features large asymmetric costs in adjusting the number of workers and small costs in adjusting the number of hours per worker  
 the effectiveness of the ecb s unconventional monetary policy  comparative evidence from crisis and non crisis euro area countries during the european financial crisis  the european central bank implemented a series of unconventional monetary policy measures  we argue that these programs lowered the bond yield spreads of euro area countries  this hypothesis is tested using pooled ols estimations and two different datasets  monetary policy event dummies and the purchase volumes of the securities markets programme  smp   overall  we find significantly negative effects on bond yield spreads for both datasets  leading us to accept the hypothesis  while the omt reduces the spreads of both crisis and non crisis countries  ltros and the lowering of the deposit rate to 0 percent are mainly effective in non crisis countries  the smp lowers the spreads of crisis countries  but it has the opposite effect on non crisis countries  this converse effect is explained by the risk that increasingly accumulates on the ecb s balance sheet through the smp and that way constitutes a fiscal risk for non crisis countries  the results are confirmed by pooled ols estimations that measure the effect of unconventional monetary policy on central government debt   c  2017 elsevier ltd  all rights reserved  
 the effects of credit default swap trading on information asymmetry in syndicated loans this study shows that initiation of credit default swap  cds  trading for an entity s debt increases the share of loans retained by loan syndicate lead arrangers and increases loan spread  these findings are consistent with cds initiation reducing the effectiveness of a lead arranger s stake in the loan to serve as a mechanism to address the adverse selection and moral hazard problems in the loan syndicate  additional findings corroborate this interpretation by revealing a moderating effect for firms with greater transparency  for loans originated by a lead arranger with a strong reputation in this market  and for firms with relatively illiquid cds markets   c  2017 elsevier b v  all rights reserved  
 the effects of institutional investor objectives on firm valuation and governance we find that ownership by different types of institutional investors has varying implications for future firm misvaluation and governance characteristics  dedicated institutional investors decrease future firm misvaluation  in both direction and magnitude  relative to fundamentals  in contrast  transient institutional investors have the opposite effect  using the u s  securities and exchange commission  sec  regulation fd as an exogenous shock to information dissemination  we find evidence consistent with dedicated institutions having an information advantage  similarly  dedicated investors are associated with better future governance characteristics  while transient investors are not  the valuation effects are primarily driven by institutional portfolio concentration while the governance effects are driven by portfolio turnover  these results imply a more nuanced relationship between institutional ownership and firm value and corporate governance  published by elsevier b v  
 the effects of interplay between negotiation tactics and task complexity in software agent to human negotiations modern networked business environment enables design of flexible and effective mechanisms of exchange between economic parties  online negotiations allow geographically and temporally separated participants to engage in exchange of offers in search for acceptable agreements  the digital medium enables development of software agents  which can assist with negotiation tasks while saving time and human effort  the current paper investigates the prospects of utilizing software agents in negotiations with the human counterparts  it presents the findings from experiment where human subjects acted as buyers negotiating with software agent sellers over a mobile phone plan  an electronic negotiation system incorporating software agents was used in the experiment  the agents employed various concession making schedules while engaging in negotiation tasks involving one of two complexity levels  negotiation task complexity was manipulated using different number of issues involved in the negotiations  subjects were recruited among university students  negotiations between the subjects and agents took place during a two day period in an asynchronous mode through the web  the findings suggest that interaction between negotiation task complexity and negotiation tactic has significant effects on negotiation outcomes and subjective assessments by the human participants  in particular  task complexity had a higher impact on the agreement rate when agents employed a competitive tactic vs  when they used a conceding one   c  2017 elsevier b v  all rights reserved

 the effects of relative size  profitability  and growth on corporate capital allocations resource allocation in firms is often done in relative terms  allocations to each project or  in the case of multibusiness firms  business segments are not made independently but through comparisons among the options  in that context  it becomes particularly important to identify the organizational factors that might influence those processes  as well as the mechanisms that create that influence  in this article  we investigate one of those potential factorsthe size of a business segment relative to the rest of the organizationand two possible accounts  one is a naive tendency to spread out allocations evenly over the firm s segments that would cause managers to relatively ignore differences in size and favor smaller segments over larger ones  holding other variables constant  the second is a tendency to direct larger allocation to the segments with the most political power and clout within the organization  which would normally favor larger segments  as those generally possess more influence  we investigate these competing hypotheses in a cross section of firms to conclude that both mechanisms are partially at play  we find that both the smallest and the largest of segments are favored in the capital allocation process  moreover  we find that the segment s growth and profitability as well as corporate management ownership of the company moderate those effects  
 the effects of tangible rewards versus cash rewards in consecutive sales tournaments  a field experiment we investigate the effects of tangible versus cash rewards in a repeated tournament setting  firms frequently use tangible rewards to motivate employees  but minimal research has examined their effects relative to cash rewards  we conducted a field experiment at a rug wholesaler that held two consecutive sales tournaments for its retailers  the top three retailers in each tournament received either cash rewards or tangible rewards  gift cards  to be distributed to sales staff  we do not find significant effects of reward type in the first tournament  however  in the second tournament  retailers eligible for tangible rewards significantly outperformed those eligible for cash rewards  and this effect is driven by tournament one losers  our results are consistent with the theory that tournament one losers competing for tangible rewards increased sales effort in the second tournament significantly more than their counterparts competing for cash rewards  our results have practical and theoretical implications

 the fire under the gridiron  resource dependence and ncaa conference realignment resource dependence theory posits that interorganizational cooperation is a key means of reducing uncertainty and ensuring survival  but little research to date has investigated how coalitions of organizations reduce uncertainty and ensure survival  both for the coalition and the member institutions  in this research  we explore how relative bargaining power and legitimacy impact the structure and performance of coalitions  we analyze fifteen years of coalition realignment and performance among college football conferences  using a comparative case study approach  we find that relative bargaining power and legitimacy have different implications for strong and weak conferences  and that those differences in power and legitimacy drive different performance orientations and outcomes  this results in a paradigm where the most powerful coalitions can ensure the greatest performance and exert the highest amount of autonomy with the least amount of restraints on member organizations

 the hierarchical repeat sales model for granular commercial real estate and residential price indices this paper concerns the estimation of granular property price indices in commercial real estate and residential markets  we specify and apply a repeat sales model with multiple stochastic log price trends having a hierarchical additive structure  one common log price trend and cluster specific log price trends in deviation from the common trend  moreover  we assume that the error terms potentially have a heavy tailed  t  distribution to effectively deal with outliers  we apply the hierarchical repeat sales model on commercial properties in the philadelphia baltimore region and on residential properties in a small part of amsterdam  the results show that the hierarchical repeat sales model provides reliable indices on a very detailed level based on a small number of observations  the estimated degrees of freedom for the t distribution is small  largely rejecting the commonly made assumption of normality of the error term

 the ifrs option to reclassify financial assets out of fair value in 2008  the roles played by regulatory capital and too important to fail status amendment of ias 39 by the iasb in 2008 provided an option to reclassify investments from fair value to historical cost  we predict that too important to fail  titf  banks took less advantage of this option because the political protection they enjoyed insulated them from regulatory pressure  banks that did not enjoy this protection had greater reason to make use of this option since doing so would protect their tier 1 capital  as predicted  findings reveal that titf banks made less use of the reclassification option to protect their tier 1 capital and there is a significant moderating influence of titf status on the incentive to reclassify investments for banks with lower regulatory capital  this finding is consistent with titf banks placing less weight on protecting regulatory capital and thereby retaining flexibility to sell assets  our findings provide evidence that accounting choices are affected by the importance of banks to their economies  
 the impact of agility on the market performance of born global firms  an exploratory study of the  tech city  innovation cluster although there is some recognition that agility is advantageous for a born global firm  the concept of agility is underexplored in the management and marketing literature  little is known about the ability of born globals to become agile and under what conditions agility can lead to better market performance  in this investigation the exploratory qualitative research was conducted using the data of fifteen in depth interviews with managers and experts in tech city in london  uk  firstly  the findings show that creativity and informal planning are the main decision making drivers of agility in born global firms  secondly  the study reveals that agility is more likely to be positively related to international market performance when key decision makers have certain skills  including knowledge of the market  international experience  learning orientation and ambiguity tolerance  
 the impact of audit committee expertise on audit quality  evidence from uk audit fees governance regulators currently place great emphasis on ensuring the presence of financial expertise on audit committees  sarbanes oxley  2002  uk corporate governance code 2010 2016   underlying this is a belief that greater expertise enhances the effectiveness of audit committees and  by extension  the quality of the external audit  this study investigates the impact of audit committee expertise on one measure of audit quality audit fees paid by ftse350 companies  our analysis finds that audit committees possessing greater levels of financial expertise are associated with higher audit fees  when we segregate financial expertise between accounting and non accounting  we find that the positive impact identified is driven by non accounting expertise  furthermore  when we separate ftse100 and ftse250 firms we find the impact of financial expertise is confined to ftse250 firms  our findings are important as they highlight the usefulness of segregating financial expertise between specialists and non specialists  something which regulators in the uk and in the usa currently do not do  our findings also highlight the potential value of audit committee expertise in smaller as opposed to larger listed firms  suggesting that the value of expertise to audit quality depends on the specific financial reporting challenges firms face   c  2017 elsevier ltd  all rights reserved  
 the impact of bank merger growth on ceo compensation we examine the impact of bank mergers on chief executive officer  ceo  compensation during the period 1992 2014  a period characterised by significant banking consolidation  we show that ceo compensation is positively related to both merger growth and non merger internal growth  with the former relationship being higher in magnitude  while ceo pay risk sensitivity is not significantly related to merger growth  ceo pay performance sensitivity is negatively and significantly related to merger growth  collectively  our results suggest that  through bank mergers  ceos can earn higher compensation and decouple personal wealth from bank performance  furthermore  we document a more severe agency problem in ceo compensation as a consequence of bank mergers relative to mergers in industrial firms  finally  we find that the post financial crisis regulatory reform of executive compensation in banks has limited effectiveness in curbing the merger pay links

 the impact of clawback provisions on information processing and investment behaviour proposals after the last financial crisis in 2008 have called for an extension of the scope of clawback provisions in compensation contracts beyond what is commonly legally required  under such an extended scope  managers would be held accountable for losses  the reason for such an extended scope is to counter incentives for excessive risk taking that are currently present in many bonus contracts  we argue that such a call for an extended scope of clawback provisions ignores implications from prospect theory and motivated reasoning  we propose that if an investment decision can lead to either a gain or a loss for a company  then clawback provisions have a restraining effect on risk taking compared to bonus only contracts  in contrast  if the outcome of a decision affects only the potential size of a company s loss  then clawback provisions lead to additional risk taking compared to bonus only contracts  in addition  we argue that additional accountability in a loss position leads to a motivated reasoning process  managers overweigh positive project success factors and underestimate risk  we further propose that this effect occurs despite a higher risk tolerance  as suggested by prospect theory  through an experiment  we find empirical evidence that is consistent with our predictions  our findings contribute to the debate about extending the scope of clawback provisions in management compensation contracts  we also expand the research on prospect theory by showing that motivated reasoning processes occur even when prospect theory implies a higher risk tolerance  which conceptually should negate the need for motivated reasoning   c  2016 elsevier ltd  all rights reserved

 the impact of corporate social responsibility on customer attitudes and retention the moderating role of brand success indicators although many studies report positive effects of corporate social responsibility  csr  on customer attitudes  recent literature shows that the effectiveness of csr initiatives critically varies among consumers  brands  and companies  using 1375 customer responses about 93 brands in 18 industries  we examine how perceived csr relates to customer attitudes and actual retention 2 years later  and specifically how this relationship may be contingent on brand characteristics  our results indicate that perceived csr can indeed compensate for the absence of a strong brand or smaller advertising budgets  but not for lack of innovativeness  companies that simultaneously do good and innovate are rewarded with more positive customer attitudes and higher levels of customer retention  
 the impact of european initiatives on the treatment of insurers  infrastructure investments under solvency ii against the background of seriously underfunded infrastructure and the risk of resulting lower competitiveness of the european economic area  the european commission aims to incentivise private and institutional investments in infrastructure  thereby laying one main focus on pension funds and insurance companies  at the same time  insurers seek attractive long term investment opportunities with stable cash flows that help match their long term liabilities as an alternative to long term government bonds  which currently suffer from low interest rates  however  financing volumes are still low  indicating the existence of certain investment barriers  the aim of this paper is to study these major barriers to infrastructure investments with a focus on the insurance industry and solvency ii  along with the impact of several european initiatives that are intended to reduce barriers  thereby also providing numerical examples regarding solvency capital requirements  
 the impact of housing wealth on stock liquidity we document a housing wealth effect on the stock liquidity of local firms  we first demonstrate that the heterogeneity of homeownership rates across geographical areas can explain variations in the impact that changes in house prices have on local stock liquidity  we then show  consistent with expectations that an increase in housing wealth leads to a reduction in household risk aversion  that the liquidity of lottery stocks and stocks dominated by individual investors rises  we also show that it promotes local liquidity commonality and reduces the proportion of firm specific information revealed in stock returns  
 the impact of information technology on new product development performance many managers expect a substantial impact of digitization on new product development  npd  as it is an information intensive business process  therefore  a better understanding of how information technology  it  might improve the npd process is important for both theory and practice  drawing on the it business value literature  this study develops a comprehensive conceptual model to investigate empirically how it and non it organizational antecedents translate into npd it capabilities and competences and how these are related with npd performance  based on survey data from german npd managers  this study offers several insights  first  it shows that the development of superior npd it capabilities and competences depends on the ability to acquire and deploy suitable it  i e   firm level it capabilities  and on appropriate strategic  structural  and cultural conditions ensured by a strong top management focus on npd it  i e   executive champion for npd it   this study hence contributes empirical evidence to the npd and the it business value literature by expanding research on complementary resources  second  this study addresses limitations regarding the conceptualization of npd it capabilities and their relationship with further sources of competitive advantage arising from npd it tool usage by considering both the effectiveness and the frequency of usage as well as the relationship between both  third  this research updates the measurement of npd it tool usage effectiveness  i e   it leveraging competence  to account for technological developments  moreover  this study reveals that the effectiveness of npd it tool usage is positively associated with npd performance  it also highlights that the dissemination of it tools does not directly increase npd performance  but that npd it tool use frequency is an important antecedent of it leveraging competence  for managers  this paper offers empirical evidence that firm wide it capabilities and a focus on npd it are important predictors of npd performance  
 the impact of investments in pollution reduction on shareholder wealth  evidence from taiwanese manufacturing companies this paper investigates the economic benefit of corporate pollution reduction expenditures and the value relevance of the global reporting initiative  gri  report  it utilizes a unique dataset of pollution reduction expenditures disclosed by taiwanese manufacturing companies in their gri reports  economic profit is measured with economic value added and tobin s q  the value relevance is measured with three benchmarks  stock returns  cash flows  and stock prices  the generalized method of moments is adopted to control for potential endogeneity  this paper finds a positive relation between pollution reduction expenditure and corporate economic benefits  which suggests that managerial decisions aimed at pollution reduction are consistent with the interests of shareholders and of stakeholders  in addition  this paper finds that the g3 1 guideline provides relevant information in regard to firm value  while it plays merely a partial role in investors  investment decisions  copyright  c  2017 john wiley   sons  ltd and erp environment 
 the impact of latency sensitive trading on high frequency arbitrage opportunities this study examines the duration  frequency and profitability of potential high frequency arbitrage strategies between the share price index futures contract and an exchange traded fund  etf  written on the s p asx200 constituent securities traded on the australian securities exchange  asx   we find the frequency and profitability of potential arbitrage opportunities are greater during volatile and high turnover periods other things equal  we examine the impact of increased competition in high frequency trading  hft  by identifying the number of  co location connections  utilized in the asx s minimum latency liquidity center  we document an increase in the frequency  duration and value  albeit small  of index arbitrage profit opportunities with increased hft connections  our results are robust to the inclusion of transaction costs  we conclude that increased hft activity in markets increases trade execution risk associated with arbitrage  or legging risk  which in turn increases mispricing in markets   c  2016 elsevier b v  all rights reserved  
 the impact of market structure on ex dividend day stock price behavior we explore the impact of market structure on the ex day price anomaly  measuring the price drop ratio  pdr  as the ratio of the price change on the ex day to the dividend amount  we find that the average nasdaq pdr is significantly less than one and significantly less than the new york stock exchange  nyse  pdr  we then investigate a subset of firms that voluntary switch from nasdaq to the nyse and find that the pdr significantly increases after the switch  suggesting that market structure affects pdrs  we also create a matched sample and find that the nasdaq pdr converges toward its matched nyse counterpart  particularly after the introduction of supermontage  our evidence is consistent with significant nasdaq market structure changes reducing execution cost differences between the two exchanges and  in turn  reducing the pdr difference  overall  our results highlight the important role market structure can play in understanding anomalies  
 the impact of portfolio disclosure on hedge fund performance consistent with the argument that portfolio disclosure reveals trade secrets  a difference in differences estimation suggests a drop in fund performance after a hedge fund begins filing form 13f as well as an increase in return correlations with other funds in the same investment style  the drop in performance is concentrated among funds with larger expected proprietary costs of disclosure  for instance  funds that disclose a greater fraction of their assets or hold more illiquid stocks  the drop in performance cannot be fully explained by alternative explanations such as decreasing returns to scale or mean reversion in fund returns   c  2017 elsevier b v  all rights reserved  
 the impact of positive and negative emotions on loyalty intentions and their interactions with customer equity drivers customer equity drivers  ceds  include value  brand  and relationship equity  which have a strong link with loyalty intentions  this study aims to examine the incremental effects of positive and negative emotions on loyalty intentions and to determine whether these emotions moderate the positive link between ceds and loyalty intentions  we use customer data with 102 leading firms across eighteen services industries in the netherlands  the results show that  1  positive and negative emotions have incremental effects on loyalty intentions   2  positive emotions weaken the positive link  negative interaction   and  3  negative emotions strengthen the positive link  but only for brand and relationship equity  positive interaction   thus  positive and negative emotions also explain loyalty intentions  however  managers should be cautious when combining ceds with positive and negative emotions  we provide a strategic matrix to help managers arrive at effective combinations  
 the impact of shoreline stabilization on economic growth in small island developing states this paper assesses the economic growth impact of shoreline stabilization policy in small island developing states  concentrating on the barbadian efforts to stem shoreline retreat  it explores whether investments in shoreline stabilization and beach amenity enhancement have beneficial effects on medium term economic growth  the analysis relies on the synthetic control method as a way to systematically choose comparison units  beach sites   which allows for precise quantitative inference in small sample studies  our results indicate that in the first three years after shoreline stabilization works were completed  local economic effects  as measured by nighttime lights data  are positive and indicate a positive trend  confidence bounds obtained by a bootstrapping method suggest that the positive trend is robust in the last two years post treatment  shoreline stabilization works may therefore not only help preserve fragile ecological conditions  but further lead to sustainable growth in the local economy   c  2017 elsevier inc  all rights reserved  
 the impact of sovereign rating changes on the activity of european banks we verify the effects of sovereign rating revisions on the activity of european banks  in terms of their regulatory capital ratio  profitability  liquidity  and lending supply  first  we find that a sovereign downgrade has a significant impact  primarily on capital ratios and lending supply  in contrast  upgrades do not have a significant impact  indicating an asymmetric effect of sovereign rating changes  second  we find that three transmission channels  assets channel  funding channel  and rating channel  explain a relevant part of the impact of a sovereign downgrade  finally  we find strong evidence that the rating based regulation affects all measures of the activity of domestic banks  causing negative externalities for financial institutions  our results hold also controlling for sovereign risk  estimating a gmm system  and employing an instrumental variable approach   c  2017 elsevier b v  all rights reserved  
 the impact of stereotyping on consumers  food choices there is mounting evidence to show that peoples food choices are influenced by social others  however  there is scant research on how consumers  food choices are affected by perceived competence of others present in the retail setting  the findings of study 1 indicate that when the other customer is perceived as competent  i e   paying with a platinum amex   the focal consumer chooses the same  organic vs  standard  chicken wrap  however  such a mimicking behavior is absent when the other customer lacks competency cues  i e   paying with food stamps   study 2 shows that social modeling doesn t occur in the context of indulgent food choices  moreover  the findings of study 2 demonstrate that competence cues perceived similarity between the other customer and the focal consumer  
 the impact of the economic crisis on latent and early entrepreneurship in europe the recent economic crisis has thrown many european economies into a period of slow growth and high unemployment  while previous research looked at the impact of the crisis on aggregate indicators of entrepreneurship  not much is known about whether and how it affected individual motivations and efforts to become self employed  this study aims to fill this gap by looking at the impact of the crisis on latent and early entrepreneurship  as well as on the link between the two  we combine individual and country level data from 25 eu member states from 2006 to 2012  results of multilevel logistic regressions show that the decrease in entrepreneurial activity in the post crisis period has been stronger in countries where access to finance for smes has been more difficult  moreover  we show that the high level unemployment generated by the economic crisis has produced a  refugee effect  by pushing into entrepreneurship only those individuals who are not interested in such a career choice  
 the impact of transaction costs on state contingent claims mispricing we analyze the impact that transaction costs have on asset mispricing in state contingent claims markets  in particular  we examine betting markets  in which  it has been argued  transaction costs cause the favorite longshot bias  a pricing anomaly analogous to the volatility smile in options markets  by using a heterogeneous agents model  we prove that transaction costs alone cannot cause mispricing  also  we run agent based simulations to character  ize the response of market prices to increments in transaction costs  we find that transaction costs have a significant impact on market inefficiency  by amplifying existing mispricing both directly  influencing market prices  and indirectly  inducing a nonlinear response from the agents   c  2017 elsevier inc  all rights reserved  
 the impact of war  new business networks and small scale contractors in britain  1739 1770 this article argues that the resources and skills of military contractors were a crucial component of the war making capacity of the british state in the mid eighteenth century  contractors used product knowledge  access to capital and credit  market intelligence  and personal and professional connections to perform contracts effectively  and by doing so contributed towards operational capability and combat readiness  contracting not only reveals the diversity of the domestic economy but also the degree of connectivity between different sectors  problems of scale  cost  and risk were overcome by harnessing and channelling broad expertise across different sectors  if modern states were highly innovative in fiscal military terms  contractors were no less so in managing extensive supply operations  
 the implications of offering free versions for the performance of paid mobile apps the mobile application  app  industry has grown tremendously over the past ten years  primarily fueled by small app development businesses  lacking advertising budgets  these small and relatively unknown businesses often offer free versions of their paid apps to be noticed in the crowded app industry and to reduce customer uncertainty about app quality and fit  the authors build on the existing marketing and information systems literature on sampling and versioning to investigate the implications of offering free versions for the adoption speed of paid apps  using a unique data set of 7 7 million observations from 12 315 paid apps  and accounting for endogeneity  the authors find that although the practice of offering free versions of paid apps is popular  it is negatively associated with paid app adoption speed  they also find that this negative association between free version presence and paid app adoption speed is stronger both for hedonic apps and in the later life stages of paid apps  the authors hope that the study s results will encourage app developers to reevaluate their current strategy of offering free versions of paid apps and prompt academics to produce more work focusing on this industry  
 the importance of firm level multinationality in the country versus industry debate we conduct the most comprehensive empirical analysis that exists to date of the effect multinationality has on the explanatory power of country and industry factors in international diversification  we investigate the impact the size  scope  and location of a company s international sales has on country versus industry factors  analysing 1 276 firms from belgium  canada  france  germany  italy  japan  the netherlands  spain  the uk  and the us over the 15 year period  1998 2012  we find that the magnitude of the country factor is greater than the magnitude of the industry factor for the period as a whole but that a company s level of international sales has a greater impact on the magnitude of its industry factor than the magnitude of its country factor  counter intuitively  we find stocks with lower sales exposure to their country of origin have a higher country factor  and we show the existence of both a strong local and international industry factor  our results suggest country of origin diversification may no longer be sufficient to exploit country specific risk and the country factor has become a country classification factor  
 the imprint of labor markets on entrepreneurial performance using the 1979 2010 waves of the national longitudinal survey of youth  our study tracks the earnings of individual entrepreneurs from the beginning of their entrepreneurial careers  examining the effects of labor markets on their earnings trajectory  results show that apart from self selection  labor markets impose a penalty on the initial earnings of entrepreneurs who start a business in adverse economic conditions  a disadvantage that persists for up to a decade  we also identify two factors expected to alleviate the imprinting effect of labor markets  migration outside the imprinting environment and serial entrepreneurship   c  2017 elsevier inc  all rights reserved  
 the influence of global and local iconic brand positioning on advertising persuasion in an emerging market setting this study explores how positioning a brand as global and or local iconic can moderate the impact of advertising frequency  af  on brand attitudes in an emerging market context  we argue that brands may be seen as the source of an advertisement and that the positioning of a brand can thus enhance source attractiveness  and or source credibility  which in turn facilitate the impact of af on brand attitudes  our results support that both a global and a local iconic positioning enhance the af brand image relationship  but they do not have an effect on the af brand quality relationship  additionally  we examine whether source attractiveness and source credibility mediate these moderation effects and find that only source attractiveness is a significant mediator  additionally  we investigate whether a hybrid positioning strategy  i e   positioning as both global and local iconic  is beneficial  results indicate that a separate positioning  i e   global or local iconic  is a better strategy to increase the attractiveness of the advertising source and in turn facilitate the effect of advertising frequency to create brand image  
 the influence of service employees and other customers on customer unfriendliness  a social norms perspective this research investigates the influence that social sources in the service environment exert on customer unfriendliness  drawing on social norms theory  the authors demonstrate that descriptive norms  i e   what most people are perceived to be doing in a certain situation   in the form of unfriendliness by service employees and fellow customers  predicts customers  unfriendliness toward employees  injunctive norms  i e   beliefs about which behaviors are approved by important others  and identification with fellow customers exert moderating effects  specifically  strong injunctive norms can buffer the effect of descriptive norms  furthermore  fellow customers influence a customer s unfriendliness only if he or she identifies either very strongly or very weakly with them  by clarifying the role of norms in service encounters  this study provides insights on when unfriendly customer behavior is likely to occur  managerial implications for companies who want to diminish customer unfriendliness are discussed  
 the influence of word of mouth on attitudinal ambivalence during the higher education decision making process this study investigates the influence of word of mouth  wom  on consumers  attitudinal ambivalence in the context of higher education decision making  construal level theory  clt  is combined with attitudinal ambivalence literature to generate hypotheses about how different types of wom  i e   praise and activity  received during the decision making process reduce attitudinal ambivalence  the subsequent consequences of attitudinal ambivalence for decision making are also studied  a two wave survey of applicants to international higher education programs is used to test the hypotheses  this study contributes to the ambivalence literature by showing that different types of wom information reduce attitudinal ambivalence depending on the temporal closeness of a choice and the consumption of a service  the findings have implications for the management of attitudinal ambivalence and wom throughout the consumer decision making process and consequently for assisting consumers in making choices  
 the information content of special orders we consider the role of special orders in informed traders  order submission strategies and their effect on the market price discovery process  special orders  such as fill and kill and all or nothing orders  are not entered in the order book  instead  they are executed immediately  this means they do not require costly monitoring and are not visible to other traders  due to the fact that informed institutional traders  including high frequency traders  use aggressive special orders  they generate higher price impacts than normal orders  particularly in volatile markets  crown copyright  c  2016 published by elsevier b v  all rights reserved  
 the information value of stock lending fees  are lenders price takers  we find that higher stock lending fees predict significantly lower future returns after controlling for shorting demand for us stocks during the period 2007 10  these results suggest that active institutional investors on the supply side play an important role in the return predictability of fees and they not only respond to demand but also price in additional information around earnings news announcements  overall  we find evidence that stock lenders are informed and  together with short sellers  contribute to the price discovery process  
 the institutionalization of corporate social responsibility reporting this article presents a three stage model of how isomorphic mechanisms have shaped corporate social responsibility  csr  reporting practices over time  in the first stage  defensive reporting  companies fail to meet stakeholder expectations due to a deficiency in firm performance  in this stage  the decision to report is driven by coercive isomorphism as firms sense pressure to close the expectational gap  in the second stage  proactive reporting  knowledge of csr reporting spreads and the practice of csr reporting becomes normatively sanctioned  in this stage  normative isomorphism leads other organizations to look to csr reporting as a potential new opportunity for achieving the firm s goals  in the third stage  imitative diffusion  the defensive reporters together with the proactive reporters create a critical mass of csr reporters that reaches a threshold at which the benefits of csr reporting begin to outweigh any costs due to mimetic isomorphism  the study finds support for the model in an examination of fortune 500 firms from 1997 to 2006  
 the interactive effects of goal orientation and leadership style on sales performance the authors develop and test a model depicting the moderating effects of different types of manager leadership styles on the relationship between salesperson goal orientations  i e   performance orientation and learning orientation  and performance  the two surveys were set in retail work contexts in brazil  results from a multi level hierarchical analysis demonstrate that  i  transactional leadership strengthens the positive link between learning orientation and sales performance  whereas  ii  transformational leadership weakens the positive association between learning orientation and performance  our argument for the positive moderating effect of transactional leadership is built upon the path goal theory and contingent reward mechanism  the justification for the negative effect of transformational leadership involves the follower dependency logic and overdependence on supervisory cues

 the intrinsic value of gold  an exchange rate free price index in this paper  we propose a gold price index that enables market participants to separate the change in the  intrinsic  value of gold from changes in global exchange rates  the index is a geometrically weighted average of the price of gold denominated in different currencies  with weights that are proportional to the market power of each country in the global gold market  market power is defined as the impact that a change in a country s exchange rate has on the price of gold expressed in other currencies  we use principal components analysis to reduce the set of global exchange rates to four currency  blocs  representing the u s  dollar  the euro  the commodity currencies and the asian currencies  respectively  we estimate the weight of each currency bloc in the index in an error correction framework using a broad set of variables to control for the unobserved intrinsic value  we show that the resulting index is less volatile than the usd price of gold and  in contrast with the usd price of gold  has a strong negative relationship with global equities and a strong positive relationship with the vix index  both of which underline the role of gold as a safe haven asset   c  2017 elsevier ltd  all rights reserved

 the issuance of warrants in rights offerings  agency costs and signaling effects we examine the issuance choice across rights issues of equity  unit offerings  and standalone warrants and investigate the market reactions to these issue types  we find that agency costs  growth opportunities  and current funding needs relative to assets in place are prime drivers of the type of equity issuance choice  managers use quality signals such as underpricing  underwriting status  and the proportion of funds raised by exercising warrants in determining the features of the warrant issue  furthermore  we document that the market reacts more favorably to standalone warrants issues than units and equity during the rights offering period  
 the jilting effect  antecedents  mechanisms  and consequences for preference this research explores how the experience of a jilt the anticipation and subsequent inaccessibility of a highly desirable  aspirant option influences preference for incumbent and non incumbent options  the authors conceptualize jilting as a multi stage process  which consists of a pre jilt anticipatory phase that is initiated on the introduction of an aspirant option and a post jilt phase that is initiated when the aspirant option becomes inaccessible  they show that during the anticipatory phase  a process of denigration specific to the incumbent option is engendered  the subsequent jilt elicits a negative emotional response  during the affectively charged post jilt phase  preference shifts away from the nowdenigrated incumbent option  yielding a jilting effect  in four field and laboratory studies  the authors establish this jilting effect  rule out alternative accounts  and discuss the theoretical and managerial implications of the findings  
 the jobs act and information uncertainty in ipo firms this study examines the effect of the jumpstart our business startups act  jobs act  on information uncertainty in ipo firms  the jobs act creates a new category of issuer  the emerging growth company  egc   and exempts egcs from several disclosures required for non egcs  our findings are consistent with proprietary cost concerns motivating egcs to eliminate some of the previously mandatory disclosures  which increases information uncertainty in the ipo market  attracts investors who rely more on private information  and leads egcs to provide additional post ipo disclosures to mitigate the increased information uncertainty  our results also are consistent with agency explanations  whereby egcs exploit the jobs act provisions to avoid compensation related disclosures  which results in larger ipo underpricing for such firms  overall  we provide evidence on how reduced mandatory disclosure affects the ipo market  
 the light and shade of knowledge recombination  insights from a general purpose technology this research focuses on a special case of general purpose technology  bioinformatics  it explores whether   and to what extent   bioinformatics inventions build upon inherently diverse knowledge sources  precisely  the role of scientific and technological diversity  measured with shannon wiener diversity index  as driver of impactful bioinformatics inventions  measured at different standard deviations of the forward citations distribution  is investigated  to this purpose  we carried out an analysis of both non patent and patent references cited into bioinformatics patented inventions in the period 1976 2014  results from a series of logistic regression models indicate that different degrees of impact require different degrees of knowledge diversity  at the same time  and importantly for practitioners and scholars  recombining diverse scientific and technological knowledge bases not always lead to impactful inventions  in other terms  the interplay of science and technology is not always the best option to get impactful inventions  
 the long term impact of service empathy and responsiveness on customer satisfaction and profitability  a longitudinal investigation in a healthcare context rising labor costs in healthcare industries have led many firms to underinvest in service empathy and responsiveness by downsizing staffing levels  although such a strategy may help contain operating costs and improve productivity in the short run  its sustainability and long term effect remain unclear  as the literature offers competing explanations of such an effect on customer satisfaction and overall profitability  using 24 quarters of longitudinal patient satisfaction data and archival financial data from 25 clinical units in a large healthcare organization  this study examines how empathy and responsiveness influence profitability over time  the findings show that downgrading empathy and responsiveness allows firms to lower costs  resulting in immediate productivity benefits  however  this strategy has an enduring negative effect on customer satisfaction and ultimately hurts profitability in the long run

 the need to give gratuitously  a relevant concept anchored in catholic social teaching to envision the consumer behavior the  gift exchange theory  articulated by marcel mauss  along with his core concept of a threefold obligation  giving receiving returning   is the dominant theoretical framework used to explain the majority of gift issues in marketing  this perspective assumes that some interest always lies behind gifts  such that a gift always implies a counterpart of receiving something in return  despite the relevance of this approach in understanding the day to day consumer behavior  this paper presents empirical cases where the consumer is also able to give freely  that is to say without implying a counterpart or even expecting it  to explain those empirical cases  we mobilize a key teaching of the catholic church  the  gratuitous gift  and then introduce the concept of the  need to give   we show that gratuitousness is a relevant concept to understand most of gifts made by consumers  and we develop the normative aspect of gratuitous gift for ethical marketers  i e   what ethical marketers should consider to understand consumers properly and in a more humanistic way   we also show that catholic social teaching offers an appropriate anthropology to understand consumer behaviors motivated by this need for gratuitousness  to conclude  we propose further avenues of research

 the networking behavior of indian executives under environmental uncertainty abroad  an exploratory analysis focused networking has become a significant source of effective internationalization  prior research has shown that networking can improve the internationalization performance of companies  as local contacts provide access to relevant information that is typically unavailable otherwise  several factors  such as the level of environmental uncertainty faced abroad  can significantly affect the optimal networking of senior executives in foreign markets  however  there is a lack of research about how environmental uncertainty affects ideal networking behavior  in this study  we examined the impact of the fit between environmental uncertainty and the networking behavior of indian executives on the internationalization performance of their companies  we collected data from 197 indian executives with significant experience in european and other markets to test our model  we examined five potential environmental uncertainty factors  including the fdi related environment  the macroeconomic environment  the material and infrastructure environment  the consumption environment and the competitive environment  as well as four networking behavior dimensions  including proactivity  commitment  strategy and tie strength  the results from a profile deviation analysis reveal that ideal networking behavior profiles exist for different types and levels of environmental uncertainty  in summary  the findings from the study provide useful guidelines for indian and other executives about how to network abroad given different types and levels of environmental uncertainty  and they offer new perspectives to improve the internationalization performance of these executives  
 the nhs  sticking fingers in its ears  humming loudly evidence exists that the uk national health service  nhs  has had  over many years  persistent problems of negative and intimidating behaviour towards staff from other employees  the evidence also suggests the organisational responses to negative behaviour can be inadequate  a conceptual model of organisational dysfunction was proposed to assist in explaining those responses and the overall culture in the nhs  pope and burnes 2013   through research this model has been tested  based upon the findings  an extended and developed model of organisational dysfunction is presented  a qualitative approach was taken to research the organisational responses to negative behaviour  and the reasons and motivations for those responses  forty three interviews and six focus groups were conducted  there seem to be  islands  and  pockets  with a positive culture  however  the generalised evidence suggests the nhs is systemically and institutionally deaf  bullying  defensive and dishonest  exhibiting a resistance to  knowing   denial and  wilful blindness   a dysfunctional  perverse and troubled organisation  totalitarian and kafkaesque characteristics are identified  the nhs could also be described as a coercive bureaucracy and under certain definitions  a corrupt entity  the nhs appears to be an organisation with a heart of darkness  a  self perpetuating dysfunctional system   there may be widespread  learned helplessness   it seems to be a  good news factory   rejecting and hiding any  bad news   retreating from reality  the nhs appears to have  lost its way  and its focus purpose as an institution  the dysfunctional organisational behaviours manifest in the nhs need to be addressed urgently as there is a detrimental  sometimes devastating  impact on the wellbeing of both staff and patients  the nhs needs to embrace an identity of being a listening  learning and honest organisation  with a culture of respect  
 the ownership distance effect  the impact of traces left by previous owners on the evaluation of used goods this article examines how salient traces left by previous owners on used goods influence product evaluations  based on the concept of psychological ownership  we propose the ownership distance effect in the context of buying used goods  we argue that when there are salient traces left by previous owners on a used good  it will widen the ownership distance between the potential buyers and the product  as a consequence  buyers will tend to evaluate the product less positively  four experimental studies were conducted  and the results support this prediction  buyers preferred used goods with salient traces left by a previous owner less  studies 1 and 2  due to the ownership distance effect  in addition  perceived psychological ownership mediates the ownership distance effect  studies 2 and 4   however  this negative effect decreased when specific situations  e g   free housecleaning service  lessened the ownership distance  or when people believed that a previous owner s trace would benefit them in obtaining their consumption goal  studies 3 and 4   the analysis of actual transactions from also confirms this effect  study 5   we conclude with a discussion of the substantive theoretical and managerial implications of this research  
 the paradox of breadth  the tension between experience and legitimacy in the transition to entrepreneurship in a study of artists who launched independent record labels in the music industry from 1990 to 2013  we focus on explaining the paradox generated when prospective entrepreneurs accumulate broad functional experience  which signals to resource providers mastery of different skills and access to various information and resources but may also undermine the legitimacy of their entrepreneurial claims because they are not seen as specialists  to resolve this paradox  we theorize that the potential legitimacy discount of categorical membership can be avoided when individuals are classified according to multiple categories simultaneously  we find that the transition to entrepreneurship is most likely to occur when an artist s functional experience is broad but market experience is narrow  he or she has mastered a variety of skills but solicited few audiences  we also find that the paradox of breadth is attenuated the potential penalty of functional breadth and the corresponding need to develop narrow market experience are reduced when the entrepreneur has alternate methods of signaling legitimacy  including high status and more typical prior work experience  moreover  some audiences are more disposed than others to allow an entrepreneur to pursue greater novelty  our findings suggest that mastering a variety of skills is not universally beneficial for aspiring entrepreneurs  in some circumstances  such mastery is best coupled with a narrow market focus  
 the pareto rule for frequently purchased packaged goods  an empirical generalization many markets have historically been dominated by a small number of best selling products  the pareto principle  also known as the 80 20 rule  describes this common pattern of sales concentration  several papers have provided empirical evidence to explain the pareto rule  although with limited data  this article provides a comprehensive empirical investigation on the extent to which the pareto rule holds for mass produced and distributed brands in the consumer packaged goods  cpg  industry  we used a rich consumer panel dataset from a c  nielsen with 6 years of purchase histories from over 100 000 households  our analysis utilizes a large number of potential factors such as brand attributes  category attributes  and consumer purchase behavior to explain variation in the pareto ratio at the brand level across products  our main conclusion is that the pareto principle generally holds across a wide variety of cpg categories with the mean pareto ratio at the brand level across product categories of  73  several variables related to consumer purchase behavior  e g   purchase frequency and purchase expenditure  are found to be positively correlated with the pareto ratio  in addition  niche brands are more likely to have a higher pareto ratio  finally  brand category size  promotion variables  change of pace brands  and market competition variables are negatively correlated with the pareto ratio

 the penalty for privacy violations  how privacy violations impact trust online with information misuse as a particularly salient form of risk online  respecting privacy is often closely tied to trust in consumer surveys  this study uses factorial vignette survey methodology to measure the relative importance of violating privacy expectations to consumers  trust in a website  the findings suggest consumers find violations of privacy expectations  specifically the secondary uses of information  to diminish trust in a website  firms that violate privacy expectations are penalized twice  violations of privacy  1  impact trust directly and  2  diminish the importance of trust factors such as integrity and ability on trust  in addition  consumers with greater technology savvy place greater importance on privacy factors than respondents with less knowledge  violations of privacy may place firms in a downward trust spiral by decreasing not only trust in the website but also the impact of possible mechanisms to rebuild trust such as a firm s integrity and ability  
 the persistence of opportunistic insider trading we study the drivers of persistent insider trading profitability by examining the trades of insiders whose past trades have been profitable  we find that the current transactions of these persistently profitable  pp  insiders better predict firm performance than those of other insiders  the relative abnormal performance is more pronounced for trades of insiders who are managers rather than large shareholders or unaffiliated insiders and for trades in firms with weaker governance and greater information asymmetry  the trades of pp insiders also better predict earnings surprises  major corporate news  and analyst revisions  collectively  these results indicate that pp insider transactions provide valid signals regarding future firm performance and that persistence in profitability is driven by informational advantages  
 the politics of buying  boycotting  complaining  and disputing  an extension of the research program by jung  garbarino  briley  and wynhausen research in political psychology indicates that liberals are less motivated than conservatives by epistemic  existential  and relational needs to reduce uncertainty  threat  and social discord  and are therefore more prone to challenge the status quo  in a compelling extension of this work into the field of consumer behavior  jung  garbarino  briley  and wynhausen  this issue  demonstrate that people residing in more liberal  vs  conservative  areas register more complaints with the us consumer financial protection bureau  federal communications commission  and national highway traffic safety administration  and dispute more resolutions offered in response to their complaints  furthermore  liberals were found to object more strongly to the hypothetical imposition of an unanticipated banking fee  and this effect was mediated by system justification  inspired by jung and colleagues  we investigated the hypothesis that liberals would also be more likely to buy and boycott consumer products for political reasons  we analyzed data from the american national election studies and european social surveys and discovered that  even after we adjusted for demographic factors  liberals in the united states and leftists in all 15 european countries were more likely than conservatives and rightists to report having bought a product or refrained from buying a product for political reasons  
 the politics of government financial management  evidence from state bonds in the  3 7 trillion u s  state and local government bond market  greater issuance costs  lower issue prices and greater underwriting fees  benefit financial institutions  while costing taxpayers  campaign contributions by politically supportive underwriters can be associated with lower issuance costs  alternatively  contributions can influence a politician to accept greater costs  this paper s evidence suggests that contributions influence politicians  in the absence of an underwriter auction  underpricing increases with the chosen underwriter s contributions relative to others  moreover  the difference in the fees charged by contributing underwriters and those charged by non contributing underwriters is 2 9   in the presence of an underwriter auction  these results are statistically insignificant   c  2017 elsevier b v  all rights reserved  
 the power of one to make a difference  how informal and formal ceo power affect environmental sustainability we theoretically discuss and empirically show how ceo power based on environmental expertise and formal influence over executives and directors  in the absence and presence of shareholder activism  spurs firms toward greener strategies  our results support the idea that ceos with informal power  grounded in expertise  reduce corporate environmental impact and this relationship is amplified when the ceo also enjoys formal power over the board of directors  additionally  we found that any source of ceo power  whether informal or formal  is a good catalyst for transforming shareholder activism into corporate greening  however  in the absence of such activism  only ceos  informal environmental expert power acts as a determinant of firm environmental performance

 the real mystery of positive business  a response from christian faith i ask why an increasing number of business scholars today are drawn to an idea of  positive business  that they cannot account for scientifically  i answer that it is because they are attracted to the real mystery of positive business which is its incomprehensible and unspeakable divinity  i begin by asking why the research literature has yet to speak of positive business plainly and with one voice  i find that it lacks for the right words because it comes to human being in business as a science attuned to its objects rather than as a religion attuned to its spirit  next  i say what i can about the real mystery of business  keeping in mind that we can say about it only what we can say about god  this brings me at last to the christian insight that human being  in business and everywhere else  is the mystery of jesus christ in whom we are reconciled to god  business is positively human as it invites us to be as christ  to be a fully human person in joyful communion with others in god  this  in sum  is how to speak plainly and with one voice of the positive business that our hearts desire but our science cannot say  
 the relationship between femininity and sustainability reporting most research on corporate social responsibility  csr  disclosure and stakeholder engagement with sustainable development has focused on the internal factors of corporations  leaving aside the characteristics of the institutional  cultural  and economic context of the country where corporations operate  the purpose of this study is to investigate the influence of femininity in the disclosure of sustainability information based on the global reporting initiative  gri  guidelines at a developed country context  we use three measures of the csr information disclosure by country  the gri reports per million of inhabitants  the gri reports application level  and the percentage of gri reports with external assurance  the results of this study show that countries with higher femininity orientation provide a higher quantity of sustainability reports  but do not provide higher quality sustainability reports  copyright  c  2017 john wiley   sons  ltd and erp environment 
 the relationship of coworker incivility to job performance and the moderating role of self efficacy and compassion at work  the job demands resources  jd r  approach this study examined the relationship between coworker incivility and job performance via emotional exhaustion  and the moderating effect of employee self efficacy and compassion at work on the relationship  drawing on the job demands resources  jd r  model  we hypothesized an indirect relationship between coworker incivility and job performance through emotional exhaustion  also  we predicted that the positive relationship between coworker incivility and emotional exhaustion would be weaker for employees with high self efficacy and compassion experience at work  surveys were gathered at two time points  3 months apart  from 217 frontline employees of a five star hotel in south korea  the results indicated that coworker incivility was negatively related to job performance and that the link was fully mediated by emotional exhaustion  employees  self efficacy buffered the negative outcomes of coworker incivility  whereas experienced compassion at work did not moderate the relationship between coworker incivility and emotional exhaustion  this study advances understanding of the negative consequences of coworker incivility and the ways to attenuate such negative effects  we suggested emotional exhaustion as a key psychological mechanism and revealed self efficacy belief as a boundary condition related to coworker incivility  with a focus on emotional exhaustion  this study addresses the call for a better understanding of the psychological mechanism involved in workplace incivility  also  we discovered the role that personal resources play in mitigating the negative effects of coworker incivility  finally  we extend the literature by theorizing the boundary conditions of coworker incivility using the jd r approach  
 the revealed preference of sophisticated investors berk and van binsbergen  2016  have shown that the capital asset pricing model  capm  best represents the revealed preferences of any investor who can invest in mutual funds  i e   all investors   this claim seems overly broad  as it applies to all asset classes  however  we show that hedge fund investors  revealed preferences are also best modeled by the capm  because hedge fund investors are sophisticated and can access all assets classes  our finding supports this broad claim  using the capm is rational  as we show that capm alpha correlates with managerial skill and predicts performance better than other multi factor models

 the role of national culture and corruption on managing earnings around the world earnings management involves using managerial discretion to distort firm financial performance in order to mislead stakeholders  drawing from institutional theory  we argue that national culture dimensions of power distance and institutional collectivism  which are related to how individuals view themselves with respect to others  serve as informal institutional forces that influence earnings management  we also propose that corruption  as an informal institution plays a significant role in explaining cross national variation in earnings management  using a sample of firms from 26 countries  we find support for both direct and interactive effects of these important informal aspects of the institutional context  
 the role of other customers during self service technology failure service recovery through inter customer helping is especially meaningful in the self service technology  sst  failure context because ssts are associated with a high risk of failure due to the lack of face to face contacts with employees  in understanding the phenomenon of inter customer helping  two fundamental questions are investigated in the current research   1  does social influence play a role in customers  helping decisions  and  2  what are the motives for helping  through two experimental studies  we provide evidence that two different forms of social influence play a role in helping others during sst failures  and customers have self centered  vs  other centered  motives  results from study 1 showed that individuals in the private environment indicated more willingness to help than individuals in the public environment did due to heightened perceived responsibility  study 2 revealed that tie strength influenced willingness to help via a dual pathway  perceived responsibility and social approach motives  finally  we discuss and highlight the positive influence that self centered motives can exert in the sst failure scene  
 the role of pregnancy in micro health insurance  evidence of adverse selection from pakistan with increasing interest from commercial players in developing insurance markets to meet the needs of low income people  efforts to find sustainable products have expanded rapidly yet remain elusive  this is particularly true in the domain of health insurance  where the general challenges of offering voluntary private health insurance are often exacerbated by poor underlying health services and a lack of public health programs  in an effort to identify new opportunities to expand health insurance protection to underserved markets  we analyze a rich data set from a micro health insurance program in pakistan  observing that pregnancy related care accounts for 40 percent of all claims and 36 percent of the total claims amount  we focus much of our attention on understanding the role of pregnancy in micro health insurance  we find evidence of extensive adverse selection related to pregnancy claims  both with regard to original coverage purchase and with regard to renewal  in many countries  pregnancy health care is provided by or paid for by the government  we encourage consideration of this possibility  leaving the remaining health care needs for market based health insurance

 the roles of informational unfairness and political climate in the relationship between dispositional envy and job performance in pakistani organizations drawing from conservation of resources and trait activation theory  this study unpacks the relationship between employees  dispositional envy and job performance  considering the mediating effect of informational unfairness and the moderating effect of political climate  multisource  time lagged data from employees and their supervisors in pakistani organizations show that an important reason that dispositional envy may diminish job performance is that employees develop beliefs that their organization is unfair in its information provision  this mediating role of informational unfairness is particularly salient to the extent that employees perceive that the organizational decision making climate is marked by dysfunctional politics  the study informs organizations how they can mitigate the risk that persistent feelings of envy lead to negative performance outcomes that is  by avoiding work climates that are highly political in nature

 the sharpest tool in the shed  ipo financial statement management of stem vs  non stem firms the valuation of stem  science  technology  engineering  and math  firms has recently gained attention in the literature  research has shown that  for valuation of stem firms  accounting items such as sales growth and r d expenditures matter more than bottom line earnings  we examine whether  around the time of the ipo  stem managers apply discretion over the accounting items most weighted by investors for their valuation  we find that investors tend to weigh sales growth and r d more heavily than earnings in valuing stem firms and that managers respond by managing those items rather than bottom line earnings as in prior research  we find that future stock returns of stem firms are negatively associated with sales management and not with abnormal accruals as for non stem firms  our results illuminate the differential behavior of stem managers and highlight the importance of a departure from the traditional ipo earnings management paradigm  which assumes that firms mainly manage their earnings  
 the short sale stigma despite a recent upturn  housing prices remain in flux in most cities nationwide  lenders are still left dealing with a glut of distressed properties  they can choose to foreclose on the property or allow the owner mortgagor to attempt to sell the property for less than the outstanding balance of the mortgage in a short sale agreement  the best way to clear the market of distressed properties is an important policy question  this is the first study to examine not only the price and time on market effect of being a short sale but also whether the short sale process itself creates a market stigma  
 the short  and long run effects of smoking cessation on alcohol consumption this paper examines the short  and long term effects of quitting smoking on alcohol consumption using the lung health study  a randomized smoking cessation program  the paper estimates the relationship between smoking and alcohol consumption using several self reported and objective smoking measures  while also implementing a two stage least squares estimation strategy that utilizes the randomized smoking cessation program assignment as an instrument for smoking  the analysis leads to three salient findings  first  self reported and clinically verified smoking measures provide mixed evidence on the short term impact of quitting smoking on alcohol consumption  second  the long term impact of smoking on alcohol consumption  measured with the historic 5 years smoking behavior  suggests that those with the highest average cigarette consumption and those with the longest smoking history see the largest increase in alcohol consumption  specifically  abstaining from smoking or reducing the average cigarette consumption to the mean level lowers alcohol consumption by roughly 25  per week  as a result  these findings present comprehensive evidence that smoking and drinking are complements in the long term and that the public health and finance benefits in smoking cessations treatments are undervalued

 the source of information in prices and investment price sensitivity this paper shows that real decisions depend not only on the total amount of information in prices  but the source of this information a manager learns from prices when they contain information not possessed by him  we use the staggered enforcement of insider trading laws across 27 countries as a shock to the source of information that leaves total information unchanged  enforcement reduces  increases  managers   outsiders   contribution to the stock price  consistent with the predictions of our theoretical model  enforcement increases investment q sensitivity  even when controlling for total price informativeness  the effect is larger in industries where learning is likely to be stronger  and in emerging countries where outsider information acquisition rises most post enforcement  enforcement does not increase the sensitivity of investment to cash flow  a non price measure of investment opportunities  these findings suggest that extant measures of price efficiency should be rethought when evaluating real efficiency  more broadly  our paper provides causal evidence that managers learn from prices  by using a shock to price informativeness   c  2017 the authors  published by elsevier b v

 the strategic underreporting of bank risk we show that banks significantly underreport the risk in their trading book when they have lower equity capital  specifically  a decrease in a bank s equity capital results in substantially more violations of its self reported risk levels in the following quarter  underreporting is especially frequent during the critical periods of high systemic risk and for banks with larger trading operations  we exploit a discontinuity in the expected benefit of underreporting present in basel regulations to provide further support for a causal link between capital saving incentives and underreporting  overall  we show that banks  self reported risk measures become least informative precisely when they matter the most  
 the subjective norms of sustainable consumption  a cross cultural exploration although extensive research has explored aspects of sustainable consumption  such as specific sustainable behaviors and motivations for participating in sustainable activities  little research has examined the role of national culture and how pragmatism influences sustainable consumption  sustainable consumption can encompass both sustainable attitudes and sustainable behaviors  and in this research  two types of social norms related to sustainable consumption  normative and self enhancing  are also included and examined across three nations  france  japan  and us   the findings suggest that differences in consumption are explained  in part  by the country s level of pragmatism  a cultural value  hofstede  1991   building off the theory of reasoned action  findings also show that sustainable attitudes mediate the relationship between the level of pragmatism of a respondent s nation and sustainable behaviors  
 the timing of low volatility strategy this study explores the role of investor attention impact on low volatility strategy  our evidence suggests that a low volatility strategy for high investor attention stocks is more profitable than low investor attention stocks  conditioned on high investor attention  the profitability of a low volatility strategy significantly increases due to lower returns on higher idiosyncratic volatility stocks  consistent with recent optimal beliefs theory  investors  propensity for gambling type strategies leads to negative returns with high idiosyncratic volatility stocks  our results provide a behavioral support to explain the low volatility strategy based on investors  propensity to gamble   c  2017 elsevier inc  all rights reserved  
 the type of internet access digital divide and the well being of ethnic minority and majority consumers  a multi country investigation wireless technologies and smartphones revolutionize the way consumers use the internet  how do these technological advancements affect consumer well being or life satisfaction  we hypothesize that mobile  as compared to regular only  internet use enhances consumers  perceptions of personal economic situation  which in turn  enhances life satisfaction  ethnic status  majority vs  minority  and national wealth  richer vs  poorer countries  set up boundary conditions for these effects  we test our hypotheses using multi level modeling and a large scale multinational dataset covering responses of   26 000 consumers from 21 countries  the results show that perceived personal economic situation mediates the relationship between type of internet access  regular vs  mobile  and life satisfaction  the positive effect of mobile internet use is weaker for ethnic minority than for majority consumers and stronger in poorer than in richer countries  we discuss the theoretical and practical implications for marketing and public policy  
 the unfulfilled promise of biotechnology firms  a top management team based explanation a key feature of biotechnology firms  business models is the tendency to branch into related therapeutic markets within the same industry in developing new products  recent analyses revealed that this business model has not paid off for the vast majority of firms in this industry  building on theories of learning and attention  and supported by empirical analyses of firms  ability to develop new products over two decades  this article finds evidence that initiating new product development projects targeting new to the firm therapeutic markets within the same industry disrupts firms  product development projects in their existing markets  this effect is primarily driven by firms that ventured into therapeutic markets that were not highly related to their area of expertise  and firms that did not recruit top executives with experience in newly entered markets  these results help to explain the poor performance of biotechnology firms in getting new products to market  
 the unintended normalization of gambling  family identity influences on the adoption of harmful consumption practices although gambling has been legitimized as a form of leisure  this consumption activity can have individual and social costs  policy approaches often focus on problem gambling as a discrete activity undertaken by an individual  drawing on social practice theory and family identity research  we take an alternative approach  identifying how exposure to gambling can occur in emergent ways that can have an unintended but lasting effect  based on 40 depth interviews  we identify how the pursuit of four family identity goals  membership and bonding  coming of age  emotional sustenance  and communing  plays a role in the normalization of gambling in childhood  we then explore how these goals and family gambling practices may contribute to gambling behaviour longer term  finally  we examine the interplay between family identity goals at the meso level  and wider macro level socio cultural institutions  policy and social marketing initiatives that acknowledge the influence of identity related gambling behaviour are recommended  
 the use of passives and impersonal style in civil engineering writing claims abound about passives and the impersonal style they create  few studies  however  check the claims with a large  systematic analysis of texts from either academia or industry  motivated by the need to teach effective workplace writing skills to undergraduate engineering students  this study investigates the use of passives and associated impersonal style features in 170 practitioner reports  journal articles  and student reports from civil engineering  using multidimensional analysis  a technique from corpus linguistics  and interviews of practitioners  students  and faculty  the study found that  as expected  engineering texts  compared to nontechnical texts  have a frequent use of impersonal style features  however  they use passives for a wider range of functions than is typically described in technical writing literature  furthermore  compared to the journal articles and student reports  the practitioner reports use significantly fewer features of impersonal style  the findings inform teaching materials that present a more realistically complex picture of the language structures and functions important for civil engineering practice  
 the value of restrictive covenants in the changing bond market dynamics before and after the financial crisis we examine the pricing of restrictive covenants on bond issues before and after the financial crisis  the existing literature in this area uses data from the pre crisis period  while the results of our analysis using pre crisis data are entirely consistent with existing literature  there are dramatic differences in the value of restrictive covenants between the two periods  further  the differences between the coefficients on the control variables document and elucidate the very different bond market dynamics before and after the crisis  before the financial crisis  we find a statistically significant cost reduction of around 50 basis points for the inclusion of negative pledges and restrictions on sale and leaseback activity  in the post financial crisis period  however  the benefit of these types of covenants evaporates  becoming statistically insignificant  the benefits  for investment grade firms  of restrictions on investment activities survives the financial crisis  the price effect in the pre crisis period is a statistically significant 60 to 72 basis point  depending on model  reduction in yields  while in the post crisis period it is a statistically significant 51 to 55 basis point reduction in yields  for non investment grade firms  we find in the pre crisis period that the price effect of restrictions on payouts and additional debt are insignificant  after the financial crisis  however  these restrictions lead to a statistically significant 141 to 150 basis point reduction in yields   c  2017 published by elsevier b v  
 the volatility spillover effect between index options and their underlying markets  evidence from the us  the uk  and taiwan this study examines the volatility spillover effect among five index options and their underlying markets  results show that the bidirectional volatility spillover effect and the cross market leverage effect exist between index options and their underlying markets  our findings confirm that the volatility spillover effect is generally outweighed by shocks in the underlying market  and that the options implied price volatility is provoked by the information shock occurring in both the cash and options markets to a higher degree  through the volatility impulse response function  this study shows that the options implied prices are more sensitive to innovations in both markets

 the welfare effects of fuel conservation policies in a dual fuel car market  evidence from india we estimate a model of vehicle choice and kilometers driven to analyze the long run impacts of fuel conservation policies in the indian car market  we simulate the effects of petrol and diesel fuel taxes and a diesel car tax  taking into account their interactions with the pre existing petrol fuel tax and car sales taxes  at levels sufficient to reduce total fuel consumption by 7   the increased diesel and petrol fuel taxes both yield deadweight losses  net of externalities  of about 4  2010  rs  l   however  at levels sufficient to reduce total fuel consumption by 2   the increased petrol fuel tax results in a deadweight loss per liter of fuel conserved that is greater than that caused by the diesel fuel tax  this reflects both the high pre existing tax on petrol fuel and the high own price elasticities of fuel demand in india  a tax on diesel cars that results in the same diesel market share as the large diesel fuel tax actually has a negative deadweight loss per liter of fuel conserved  the welfare effects of all three policy instruments are positive  once the external benefits of reducing fuel consumption are added to the excess burden of taxation  published by elsevier inc  
 there are no codes  only interpretations  practical wisdom and hermeneutics in monastic organizations corporate codes of ethics  which have spread in the last decades  have shown a limited ability to foster ethical behaviors  for instance  they have been criticized for relying too much on formal compliance  rather than taking into account sufficiently agents and their moral development  or promoting self reflexive behaviors  we aim here at showing that a code of ethics in fact has meaning and enables ethical progress when it is interpreted and appropriated with practical wisdom  we explore a model that represents an uncommon organizational code of ethics  the monastic rule of st  benedict  written in the sixth century and still used today  our empirical study conducted in several monasteries living under this rule shows that organization members interpret this rule  both hermeneutically and ethically  to adapt it to situations  they also appropriate this rule as a way of life and treat it as a dynamic framework that helps them to follow their purpose within their organization  this exceptional code actually offers an alternative model for practicing codes of ethics  in a virtue ethical manner  beyond mere compliance with the text  the way in which reflexive and active agents practice the code  both individually and collectively  shapes their organizational experience and fosters their moral development  
 time and space in strategy discourse  implications for intertemporal choice research summary  when describing the future  executives draw analogies between time and space  we are on the right path  the deadline is approaching   these analogies shape how executives construe the future and influence attitudes to action with long term benefits but short term costs  ego moving frames  we are approaching the future  prompt a focus on the present  whereas time moving frames  the future is approaching  underscore the advent of the future as inevitable  ultimately  action that prioritizes long term returns depends both on how executives conceive of the future and whether they believe they can engender favorable outcomes  this balance between recognizing the inevitability of the future  time moving frame  and the capacity to shape outcomes  control beliefs  stands in contrast to the more agentic forms of discourse that are dominant in strategy managerial summary  executives often prioritize maximizing immediate returns over investing to build a long term competitive advantage  how they think about the future offers one explanation for this short termism  this article distinguishes two ways of framing the future with implications for decision making  are we approaching the future  the ego moving frame  or is it approaching us  the time moving frame   as long as executives have confidence in their ability to achieve forecasted results  they focus on long term returns in their decision making when they recognize the advent of the future as inevitable  the time moving frame   in contrast  though executives use the ego moving frame to show that they are active agents  they weigh future returns less heavily when framing the future in this way  copyright  c  2017 john wiley   sons  ltd

 time disaggregated dividend price ratio and dividend growth predictability in large equity markets we consistently show that in large equity markets  the dividend price ratio is significantly related to the growth of future dividends  to uncover this relation  we use monthly dividends and a mixed data sampling technique  which allows us to address within year seasonality  our approach avoids the use of overlapping observations and at the same time reduces the impact of price volatility on the dividend price ratio  an empirical analysis using market level data from the united states  united kingdom  canada  and japan strongly supports the dividend growth predictability hypothesis  suggesting that time aggregation of dividends eliminates significant information  
 timing for dollars  how option exercisability influences resource allocation stock options have been advocated to encourage managers to make long run investments like r d and capital expenditures  capx  that entail upfront costs with the potential to generate favorable long term returns  however  the effect of options on managerial decisions depends on managerial beliefs about how the stock market reacts to firm behavior  if  consistent with empirical evidence  managers believe that stock prices increase in the short term from increased r d  but not capx  then stock option exercisabilitywhich dictates when managers can receive option payoutsshould influence resource allocation  we also consider the effect of changes in the value of options over time  results from a study of more than 6 500 observations from about 1 000 manufacturing firms over 18 years show that unexercisable stock options positively influence capx but not r d  while exercisable stock options positively influence r d but not capx  both patterns are consistent with behavior that increases managerial payoffs but not necessarily firm performance  in addition  we find an expected negative association between underwater options and capx but no evidence of a corresponding positive relation with r d  finally  we find partial evidence of a house money effect that makes allocations to capx and r d sensitive to recent changes in option values  
 to earn is not enough  a means end analysis to uncover peer providers  participation motives in peer to peer carsharing globally  the carsharing domain is growing  and new service offerings are arising  peer to peer carsharing  facilitating car rental between private individuals  has attracted attention from entrepreneurs and researchers alike  irrespective of this trend studies on carsharing have been predominantly focusing on identifying users  consumption motives in business to consumer contexts  consequently  insights on consumers  motivational drivers to offer peer to peer carsharing services remain scarce  by conducting a series of laddering interviews with german peer providers  we add to extant literature by uncovering four overarching motivational patterns that drive consumers  decision to participate as providers in peer to peer carsharing  economic interest   earn    quality of life   enjoy    helping others   enrich    and sustainability   enhance    although self centered motives of economic interest and quality of life are the dominating participation motives  peer providers also seem to be intrigued by the possibility of helping others in terms of providing mobility and thereby enabling the creation of lasting memories  paradoxically to previous assumptions regarding participation in sharing activities  sustainability is not a main participation motive for most peer providers but is rather seen as an indirect consequence of participation   c  2017 elsevier inc  all rights reserved

 top management attention to trade shows and firm performance  a relationship marketing perspective b2b marketers allocate significant resources to trade shows  but often struggle to make a strong business case for these activities  responding to calls to justify such investments  this research examines the effect that top management attention to trade shows has on firm value  based on attention theory  this study suggests that top management s focus on trade show relationship marketing efforts results in better trade show performance  this helps develop market based assets that in turn augment firm value  using an event study to extrapolate the contingent effect that top management attention to trade shows has on firm value  the basic hypothesis is supported  additionally  this research tests three top management orientations that are key to performing trade show relationship marketing activities  the findings address the absence of top management from extant trade show research and provide marketers with new insights related to maximizing their trade show investments  
 top management team structure and resource reallocation within the multibusiness firm drawing on the classic concepts of integration and differentiation from contingency theory  we analyze the impact of influential business unit  bu  executives on the capital resource allocation decisions of the multibusiness firm  capital resource allocation is one of the most important tasks of the top management team  tmt   yet management scholars have yet to explore the fundamental link between tmt structure and resource reallocation decisions  we hypothesize that greater bu influence within the firm s tmt drives greater reallocation because bu executives are positioned to focus on organizational elements related to differentiation  we also hypothesize contextual factors  based on the multidimensional nature of managerial influence  which act to limit the effect of bu influence  to support this analysis  we develop two unique measures  the first captures the degree of capital reallocation from year to year within the multibusiness firm  and the second measures the relative influence of bu executives  an empirical analysis on the sample of fortune 1000 firms confirms that bu influence is associated with capital reallocation and that bu influence is moderated by research and development  r d  intensity and unrelated diversification  
 tourism coopetition  an introduction to the subject and a research agenda this paper aims to verify the current status of the research on coopetition applied to tourism  in order to overcome the lack of tools for analyzing competitive advantage generated by relational components  this paper suggests the use of the coopetition construct as a methodological tool for analyzing the cooperation in networks for the management of tourism destinations  to that end  we performed a bibliometric analysis on  tourism coopetition  in scientific research papers published from 1995 to 2015 and indexed in the web of science and sciverse scopus databases  this helped us to conclude that coopetition is a behavior representing the key organizational methods of tourism destinations  especially when considering the interdependence and complementarity of this sector  thus  it should be a fundamental topic of tourism research  in this sense  the paper presents a research agenda in order to establish coopetition as key to understanding the behavior of all those involved in tourism at a particular destination  
 toward a framework of leader character in organizations while the construct of character is well grounded in philosophy  ethics  and more recently psychology  it lags in acceptance and legitimacy within management research and mainstream practice  our research seeks to remedy this through four contributions  first  we offer a framework of leader character that provides rigor through a three phase  multi method approach involving 1817 leaders  and relevance by using an engaged scholarship epistemology to validate the framework with practicing leaders  this framework highlights the theoretical underpinnings of the leader character model and articulates the character dimensions and elements that operate in concert to promote effective leadership  second  we bring leader character into mainstream management research  extending the traditional competency and interpersonal focus on leadership to embrace the foundational component of leader character  in doing this  we articulate how leader character complements and strengthens several existing theories of leadership  third  we extend the virtues based approach to ethical decision making to the broader domain of judgement and decision making in support of pursuing individual and organization effectiveness  finally  we offer promising directions for future research on leader character that will also serve the larger domain of leadership research

 toward a prescriptive theory of dynamic capabilities  connecting strategic choice  learning  and competition the field of strategy has mounted an enormous effort to understand  define  predict  and measure how organizational capabilities shape competitive advantage  while the notion that capabilities influence strategy dates back to the work of andrews  1971  the concept of corporate strategy  irwin  homewood   attempts to formalize a  capabilities based  approach to strategy only began to take shape in the past 20 years  in particular  the publication of teece and pisano  1994  industrial and corporate change  3 3   537 556   teece et al   1997  strategic management journal  3  509 533   and eisenhardt and martin  2000  strategic management journal  21  1105 1121  works on  dynamic capabilities  triggered a flood of debate and discussion on the topic  unfortunately  the literature on dynamic capabilities has become mired in endless debates about definitions and has engaged in an elusive search for properties that make organizations adaptable  this article argues that the research program on dynamic capabilities needs to be reset around the fundamental strategic problem facing firms  how to identify and select capabilities that lead to competitive advantage  to this end  the article develops a framework that attempts to connect firms  capability search strategies with their strategies in product markets  it frames firms  capability search strategies as choices among different types of capability enhancing investments  the key distinguishing feature of capabilities in this framework is their degree of fungibility  capabilities span a continuum ranging from highly general purpose  e g   quality management  to highly market specific  e g   knowing how to manufacture an airplane wing   to illustrate the potential of the framework to shed new light on traditional strategy questions  the article applies the framework to explore some unexplained features of penrosian diversification strategies  the article concludes by suggesting a research agenda for dynamic capabilities

 toward moral responsibility theories of corporate sustainability and sustainable supply chain in the quest to build truly sustainable corporations and supply chains  we propose  a  the moral responsibility theory of corporate sustainability and  b  the moral responsibility theory of sustainable supply chain  built from morality literature in philosophy  the view of corporations as moral agents in law  and analyses of corporate hypocrisy and its role in an organization s and its members  behaviors  our theories show how a truly sustainable corporation and its external supply chain could emerge  at the core  we believe that without a sense of moral responsibility businesses throughout the supply chain will not be truly sustainable  in today s highly globalized and fragmented business environments  corporations do businesses with external supply chain partners  and without the truly sustainable supply chain partners  they may not be able to achieve sustainability goals  moreover  for such a supply chain to be truly sustainable  each member of the supply chain must also be truly sustainable  for each member of the supply chain to be truly sustainable  the individuals who work in a corporation must be truly sustainable as well  that is  a truly sustainable supply chain cannot be established without its member corporations  and employees  commitment to and successes in sustainability  this paper shows how business moral responsibility and corporate sustainability are closely intertwined  how these theories could be applied in the corporate and supply chain settings are discussed  and future research opportunities are presented  
 towards a better understanding of the dynamics of value creation in r d intensive small firms standard financial and economic theories suggest that the stock value of r d intensive high technology small firms  htsf  undergo a geometric random walk  such a model neglects to account for observed periods where firms experience large fluctuations due to uncertainty related to its r d activities  external competitive or regulatory environments  empirical evidence also shows that the behavior of these firms is difficult to describe   let alone predict   using this gaussian process  with ambidexterity as a theoretical basis  we show that the value of htsf can be statistically described as the result of a combination of two distinct random walks  an exploitative steady state component characterized by neo marshallian equilibrium and low volatility  and a more dynamic component with high volatility reflecting bursts of large and rapid changes associated with schumpeterian outcomes of explorative processes  a mixture of two normal distributions provides an overall function that is more reflective of the empirical evidence and provides a quantitative measure for the theory that firms engage in concurrent exploration exploitation activities  a linear relationship between the two components of the mixture distribution that describe the stock value of these firms also emerges  by understanding this dual nature and its impact on stock value  firms can better manage resources and prepare for the increase in variability that are associated with exploration activities  a more accurate financial description of htsf that reduces or that anticipates uncertainty may lead to financial tools and option pricing methods that put a premium on the value of htsf markets  incentivizing investors to invest more in such firms

 trading restrictions and firm dividends  the share lockup expiration experience in china chinese firms experienced a substantial reduction in nontradable shares following the split share structure reform that began in 2005  the decrease in nontradable shares  or increase in share tradability  is associated with a decline in the firms  cash dividend payouts  the positive association is attenuated in firms with fewer financial constraints  only weakly affected by firm governance  and not affected by investment opportunities or controlling shareholder type  the results highlight the fact that firms disgorge cash to compensate shareholders for trading restrictions and conclude that dividends persist when firms have easier access to external financing  these findings are robust to alternative definitions of nontradable shares  after controlling for firm fixed effects and omitted changing firm characteristics   c  2017 elsevier b v  all rights reserved  
 training leader emotion regulation and leadership effectiveness the purpose of this study was to test whether we could train the regulation of affective displays of leaders in terms of the emotion regulation strategy of deep acting  displaying feelings one also experiences  and display of positive affect  we also tested whether this resulted in improved leadership effectiveness  i e   a mediation model in which the training results in greater leadership effectiveness through improved emotion regulation   data were obtained from a field experiment  we randomly assigned n   31 leaders  rated by n   60 subordinates  to a control group without training or an experimental group with emotion regulation training  before and 2 weeks after the intervention  deep acting  leader rated  and positive affective displays and leadership effectiveness  subordinate rated  were assessed  the training had positive effects on deep acting  positive affective displays  and leadership effectiveness  deep acting and positive affect mediated the relationship between the intervention and leadership effectiveness  we discuss how this helps build the case both for an emotional labor approach to leadership and for the leadership development potential of such an emotional labor approach  the findings of this study represent the first causal evidence that leader emotion regulation can be trained  improved emotion regulation results in greater leadership effectiveness and is one of the first empirical studies that integrates emotional labor theory to leadership effectiveness  it is therefore important from a theory development perspective

 trust and governance  the conditioning role of national culture i examine the role of national culture in conditioning the relationship between social trust and national governance  results suggest national governance and social trust have very similar bivariate associations with various dimensions of national culture  further  social trust and national governance are complements when not controlling for the impact of culture on governance  however  results suggest that the residual portion of governance  after accounting for national culture  has virtually no correlation with social trust  these results are consistent with the positive association of social trust and national governance being due to common cultural conditioning   c  2017 elsevier inc  all rights reserved  
 tv channel search and commercial breaks this study investigates time lapses that interrupt product consumption  preeminent examples are commercial breaks during television or radio programming  the authors suggest that breaks facilitate consumers  search for alternatives  specifically  when there is so much uncertainty that consumers are unclear about utility levels of different products  they engage in costly search to resolve the uncertainty  for tv programming  breaks lower the opportunity cost of search  allowing the consumer to sample alternative channels without further interrupting the viewing experience on the current channel  using data from the chinese tvmarket  the authors estimate a sequential search model to study consumer tv channel choice behavior  the data contain a quasi  natural experiment due to a chinese government policy change on commercial breaks  the natural experiment creates exogenous variations in the data that enable the empirical identification of heterogeneous consumer preference and search cost  the data patterns support the idea that viewers search for alternatives during commercial breaks  drawing on the estimates  the authors investigate how the timing of breaks affects tv channels  viewership  offering insights about how to strategically adjust the timing of breaks  
 twitter s daily happiness sentiment and the predictability of stock returns using a novel investor sentiment proxy extracted from twitter  this paper investigates whether investor sentiment as expressed in daily happiness has predictive power for stock returns in 10 international stock markets  to account for complex relationships between sentiment and stock returns  a granger non causality test in quantiles is used  our empirical results indicate that the causal relations vary across different quantiles  we observe that the causal relationship from happiness sentiment to stock returns exist only in high quantiles interval  the causal relationship from stock returns to happiness sentiment exists only in the tail area   c  2017 published by elsevier inc  
 two tests for ex ante moral hazard in a market for automobile insurance empirically separating the phenomena of moral hazard and adverse selection in insurance markets has occupied researchers in this field for decades  recently  the potential benefits of using survey data instead of claims data to control for the different dimensions of private information when testing for evidence of asymmetric information have been explored in the insurance literature  this article extends that approach to present two tests for ex ante moral hazard in a market for automobile insurance  in this article we specify  1  a recursive model and  2  an instrumental variables model to address endogeneity with respect to policy selection in cross sectional road traffic crash  rtc  survey data  we report a statistically significant ex ante moral hazard effect with both models  this result is then subjected to a falsification test  whereby the analysis is repeated in subsamples of at fault and not at fault rtcs  our antitest produces no evidence of ex ante moral hazard in the sub sample of not at fault rtcs  in which the true moral hazard may reasonably be assumed to be zero  thus supporting the interpretation of the results of our two models  our extension of the existing literature via these two specifications may have useful analogs in other insurance markets for which survey data are available  
 types of investor uncertainty and the cost of equity capital we jointly test the effects of two types of investor uncertainty  one related to future firm performance and unrelated to accruals  cash flow uncertainty  and one directly related to accrual estimation errors  accounting quality uncertainty   distinct from prior studies  our uncertainty estimates are based on a matched firm design that minimizes the mechanical relationship between the two uncertainty variables  we find a strong negative relationship between cash flow uncertainty and multiple estimates of the cost of equity capital  with respect to accounting quality uncertainty  we find a strong positiveassociation with both expected stock returns and implied costs of equity  but only in settings that control for cash flow uncertainty  collectively  our results suggest the need to consider different types of investor uncertainty when examining how investor uncertainty affects the cost of equity capital  
 uncertainty  adaptation  and alliance performance we conceptualize alliance adaptation as a bundle of governance based change practices in ongoing alliances  including contractual alterations  ownership change  board change  monitoring mechanism change  and key personnel turnover  leveraging a transaction cost perspective  we investigate how changing environmental conditions  i e   demand uncertainty and technological uncertainty  and unpredictable partner actions  i e   behavioral uncertainty  trigger ex post governance adaptations in alliances  and how these adaptations in turn affect alliance performance  using data collected from 178 partner firms in china  we find that the partner firms will undertake more extensive alliance adaptations as demand uncertainty and behavioral uncertainty increase  however  while the extent of alliance adaptations increases as technological uncertainty increases  there is a threshold level of technological uncertainty beyond which the extent of alliance adaptations decreases  the results also suggest that although alliance adaptations enhance alliance performance  this positive impact may diminish after alliance adaptations reach a certain threshold level  overall  we contribute to the alliance evolution literature by focusing on why partner firms undertake alliance adaptations and how they benefit from these ex post governance adaptations  
 uncovering configurations of hrm service provider intellectual capital and worker human capital for creating high hrm service value using fsqca although traditionally applied independently  this study combines two theoretical perspectives the intellectual capital theory and the consumer perspective   to uncover value creating configurations of human resource management  hrm  service providers  and workers  knowledge resources  we examined workers  perceptions of the value of provided hrm services using data from a sample of more than 2000 workers and the hr professionals that serve them  using fuzzy set qualitative comparative analysis techniques  we found that the hrm provider s intellectual capital is a necessary  but not always sufficient  condition for high hrm service value  further  our results show that workers can fulfil a  substitute for competence role  when they rely on their own well developed knowledge and skills to substitute for hrm professional inabilities  accordingly  this study highlights the need for studying value co creation in hrm research  that is  how both hr professionals  and workers  attributes and actions interrelate for explaining the outcomes of hrm services  
 uncovering frequency domain causality between gold and the markets of china and india  evidence from implied volatility indices we use implied volatility indices and examine short term and long term causality dynamics between gold and the chinese and indian stock markets from march 2011 to march 2017  we uncover some interesting predictability patterns that differ along the spectrum  importantly  we find significant bi directional effects between gold and the chinese and indian stock markets in both high and low frequencies  suggesting that the safe haven property of gold is not stable  our results are robust in the out of sample forecasting exercises   c  2017 elsevier inc  all rights reserved  
 under the lender s looking glass this paper studies the impact of bank monitoring on the risk of us equity reits  using a unique  hand collected data sample of mortgage balances  i show that bank screening and monitoring of reit assets via utilizing secured mortgage financing  vs unsecured  public debt  lowers the overall company risk of a reit  at the asset level  screening results in retail and office assets with higher acquisition values and located in primary markets  i e   more transparent assets  being pledged as collateral  further  i find evidence consistent with the role of lender monitoring for secured mortgage loans and show that properties located in closer proximity to a reit s headquarters are more likely to be pledged as collateral for a mortgage  
 understanding content voting based on social foraging theory why do people want to vote for or against content at some online communities and not at others  social foraging theory  particularly research on insect and other animal information sharing behavior  offers a new perspective  borrowing concepts from social foraging theory  this study proposes that four factors drive people s intention to vote online content  positively or negatively   1  altruistic motives  2  identification with the community  3  information quality  and 4  knowledge self efficacy  the research model was tested in a survey of online news communities  it found that positive voting intention was predicted by altruistic motives  community identification  and knowledge self efficacy  information quality is important for positive voting  but it works indirectly through fostering stronger community identification  negative voting intention was predicted by altruistic motives and information quality  prior research has applied foraging theory to individuals acting alone  e g   when an individual uses google to search for information online  this study expands the application of foraging theory to the community context where individuals provide votes to influence others in their chosen community  the findings advance our knowledge about content voting and provide implications for practitioners of voting systems  
 understanding ethical luxury consumption through practice theories  a study of fine jewellery purchases this paper builds on existing research investigating csr and ethical consumption within luxury contexts  and makes several contributions to the literature  first  it addresses existing knowledge gaps by exploring the ways in which consumers perform ethical luxury purchases of fine jewellery through interpretive research  second  the paper is the first to examine such issues of consumer ethics by extending the application of theories of practice to a luxury product context  and by building on magaudda s  j consum cult 11 1   15 36  2011  circuit of practice framework  this is significant in that  to date  consumer research using practice theories has focused mainly on routine and habitual practices  our findings and discussion provide an analysis of intentional and less intentional ethical consumer performances within the interconnected nexus of activities of consumers  fine jewellery consumption practice  where meanings  understandings and intelligibility of social phenomena are worked through the various activities that shape such a practice  finally  the paper concludes with significant managerial and policy related implications  as our extended circuit of practice analysis conveys that if ethics and sustainability dimensions are to be embedded in fine jewellery consumption practice  they must first be made an intrinsic part of the nexus of the social and material environment of trading and consumption places  
 understanding firms  approaches to voluntary certification  evidence from multiple case studies in fsc certification voluntary certifications  such as forestry stewardship council  fsc  in the forestry sector  are used to manage sustainable and socially responsible practices in firms  even though the certifications are based on standards  it has been reported that adopting firms are nothing but a homogeneous cohort of adopters and in fact differ in their approaches to the certification  in this paper  we conceptualize firms  approach to certification and link the approaches to various aspects of certification  using an inductive approach and deriving our data from multiple case studies from forestry fsc certification  we argue that firms  approach to certification is explained by their development of absorptive capacity  alignment of their organizational routines and their engagement in negotiations with fsc  we also argue that these approaches affect firm s benefits from certification  their level of adherence to the requirements of the certification and their likelihood to withdraw from the certification  we discuss our findings in view of the literature on absorptive capacity  institutional literature and the literature on collective action and also discuss the implications of the study to voluntary certification literature in general  
 understanding the consequences of public social media use for work social media has slowly become ubiquitous in the workplace  however  the use of these technologies has been associated with both positive and negative consequences  using the jd r model  this study examines these positive and negative consequences of the public social media use for work  survey data of 421 employees is used to explore the relationship between public social media use for work and engagement  and exhaustion  through opposing mechanisms  the findings demonstrate that interruptions and work life conflict are important demands  whereas accessibility and efficient communication are resources associated with social media use for work  these demands and resources are related to engagement and exhaustion   c  2017 elsevier ltd  all rights reserved

 understanding the failure to understand new product development failures  mitigating the uncertainty associated with innovating new products by combining scenario planning and forecasting in this paper we show that new product development  npd  is subject to fundamental uncertainty that is both epistemic and ontic in nature  we argue that this uncertainty cannot be mitigated using forecasting techniques exclusively  because these are most useful in circumstances characteristic of probabilistic risk  as distinct from non probabilistic uncertainty  we show that the mitigation of uncertainty in relation to npd requires techniques able to take account of the socio economic factors that can combine to cause present assumptions about future demand conditions to be incorrect  this can be achieved through an intuitive logics  il  scenario planning process designed specifically to mitigate uncertainty associated with npd by incorporating insights from both quantitative modelling alongside consideration of political  social  technological and legal factors  as well as stakeholder motivations that are central to successful npd  in this paper we therefore achieve three objectives  1  identify the aspects of the current il process salient to mitigating the uncertainty of npd  2  show how advances in diffusion modelling can be used to identify the social network and contagion effects that lead to a product s full diffusion  and 3  show how the il process can be further enhanced to facilitate detailed consideration of the factors enabling and inhibiting initial market acceptance  and then the forecasted full diffusion of a considered new product  we provide a step by step guide to the implementation of this adapted il scenario planning process designed specifically to mitigate uncertainty in relation to npd   c  2017 the authors  published by elsevier inc  
 understanding the human side of openness  the fit between open innovation modes and ceo characteristics in small  and medium sized enterprises  smes   where typically the decision making process is highly centralised  important decisions  such as open innovation  oi  adoption  will be strongly influenced by the characteristics of their chief executive officers  ceos   pointing the attention to the strategic leadership and human elements  this paper sheds light on the micro foundation of oi by emphasising the role that the personal traits of key individuals in innovation  oi adoption could result in the enactment of several oi modes   each representing an opportunity of potential change  of market  of technology or and of the organisation    and this paper attempts to examine the relationships between the ceo characteristics and each of the oi modes  our analysis  using korean sme data  shows that ceos  positive attitude  entrepreneurial orientation  eo   patience and education can play important roles in facilitating oi in smes  however  this paper also observed that the effects of ceo characteristics on oi adoption were differently configured according to the nature of each oi mode  for example  ceos  patience and eo had different impacts depending on the degree of uncertainty in the oi mode  this suggest that oi must be understood as a wide innovation spectrum  and  to increase opportunities for successful oi adoption  ceos have to attempt to compensate for characteristics they may lack by recruiting appropriate complementary top managements  the research has practical implications for ceos and policy makers who are interested in enhancing competitiveness of smes  
 understanding the importance of the length of global product rollout  an examination in the motion picture industry employing the resource based view of the firm and the competitive forces perspective  the authors examine how brand equity  star power  director power  and brand extensions   financial resources  and competitive intensity serve both as antecedents to the length of global product rollout and as moderators of the effect of length of global product rollout on global product performance  the results  based on data from the motion picture industry  demonstrate that brand equity  financial resources  and competitive intensity result in shorter global product rollout and that shorter global product rollout enhances global product performance  they also find that brand equity and financial resources operate as moderators  magnifying the effect of length of global product rollout on global product performance  implications for international marketing academics and practitioners are presented  
 unemployment fluctuations and the predictability of currency returns we investigate whether unemployment fluctuations generate predictability in the cross section of currency excess returns  we find that currencies with lower growth in the unemployment rate appreciate while currencies with higher growth in the unemployment rate depreciate  as a result  an investment strategy that involves investing in the former and short selling of the latter produces positive and sizable excess returns  asset pricing tests show that the predictability is not driven by exposure to traditional risk factors such as global equity risk  global foreign exchange volatility risk  and downside risk but is related instead to an idiosyncratic unemployment risk   c  2017 elsevier b v  all rights reserved  
 unemployment insurance in a three state model of the labor market the paper extends the model of krusell etal   2010  to study the welfare effects of unemployment insurance  the model unemployment insurance program includes four realistic features  1  a 50  replacement rate up to a benefit cap  2  finite duration of eligibility during a jobless spell  3  limited eligibility  and 4  and an imperfectly monitored job search requirement  the model is parameterized to fit the size of scope of unemployment insurance in the united states  removing unemployment insurance from the model leads to only a 0 1  consumption equivalent increase in average welfare  simplifying assumptions about the structure of unemployment insurance  such as allowing all job losers to receive benefits  lead to much larger welfare effects similar to the effects found in the past literature  understanding the welfare effects of unemployment insurance requires careful modeling of the structure of the program   c  2017 elsevier b v  all rights reserved  
 unpacking the ceo board relationship  how strategy making happens in entrepreneurial firms we examine how venture ceos effectively engage their boards in the strategy making process  using the inductive multiple case study approach  we track ceo board interactions inside and outside the boardroom in depth and over time through rare observations of board meetings and rich interview access to ceos and their boards of directors  our primary theoretical contributions are to the resource dependence perspective  we clarify the resource versus power tradeoff as a fundamental tension in venture ceo board relationships  further  we add a much needed process framework to resource dependence by highlighting how venture ceos use four behaviors to resolve this tradeoff in an effective strategy making process  finally  we contribute a fresh view of the venture ceo board relationship i e   spotlighting the ceo  not board  and boards as ceo director dyads  not groups   we conclude by noting implications for other key corporate governance perspectives  and indicating boundary conditions for our framework  overall  we deepen the conversation at the nexus of resource dependence theory and venture governance  
 unpacking the notion of subjectivity  performance evaluation and supervisor discretion this study puts forward the notion of subjectivity according to supervisor discretion and the organization s subjective performance evaluation rules  this is needed because most studies investigating subjectivity do not distinguish supervisor idiosyncrasies from features of the organization s management control systems  this study uses a survey to capture subjectivity and suggests that subjectivity entails two concepts  one concept is related to the amount of discretion that supervisors can exercise under the organization s current performance evaluation  the other concept concerns supervisor s idiosyncrasies when evaluating subordinates  this study provides evidence that subjectivity is multidimensional and may not represent a single concept  the results suggest that studies investigating subjectivity should treat supervisor discretion and subjective performance evaluation rules separately because of their different associations towards subordinate performance  psychological empowerment  and supervisor subordinate conflict   c  2017 elsevier ltd  all rights reserved  
 untangling the multiple effects of slack resources on firms  exporting behavior drawing on a behavioral theory perspective  we investigate how distinct types of slack resources affect distinct aspects of firms  exporting behavior  using longitudinal data of belgian manufacturing firms  we find that financial and human resource  hr  slack affect the probability of exporting positively at a diminishing rate  controlling for the export decision  we find that hr slack affects export intensity negatively  while financial and hr slack affect export diversity positively at a diminishing rate  findings are economically meaningful  especially for new exporters  taken together  our study adds new insights at the nexus of the international business and slack literatures  
 unveiling the recovery time zone of tolerance  when time matters in service recovery this article examines the link between recovery time and customer compensation expectations for service failures that cannot be immediately redressed  first  we show that the relationship between recovery time and compensation expectations is nonlinear  initially  in a recovery time zone of tolerance  compensation expectations do not increase  beyond this zone  the relationship follows an inverted u shape  such that compensation expectations first increase but decrease in the long run  second  our results show that long recovery times are accompanied by additional negative effects  including lower satisfaction with the recovery and negative word of mouth  so postponing service recovery represents a poor option  third  relationship strength functions as a moderator  first time customers expect higher compensation earlier  relational customers display a recovery time zone of tolerance but claim considerably higher compensations afterwards  fourth  communication initiatives like the separate provision of status updates or an explanation may limit increases in compensation expectations over time  still  their joint usage creates a  too much of a good thing  effect  suggesting that if the usage of communication initiatives is taken too far it may lead to negative outcomes such as increasing compensation expectations  
 upsides and downsides of the sharing economy  collaborative consumption business models  stakeholder value impacts and their relationship to context there is ambivalence and uncertainty surrounding the stakeholder value impacts of increasingly influential collaborative consumption  cc  business models  while we observe such models expanding from developed to emerging economies we lack an understanding of the role played by the local context in which they are embedded  it can be assumed that stakeholder value impacts  both positive and negative  are particularly pronounced in emerging economies  we thus ask  what are the stakeholder value impacts of cc business models and how are they influenced by an emerging economy context  based on case studies in transport and cleaning services in south africa  we develop a model of the three way interactions between local context  cc business model  and stakeholder value impacts  further  we define cc business models as manifestations of two sided markets  which allows us to better understand their positive and negative impacts on their key stakeholders  our analysis shows that both new and established cc business models must be carefully adapted to local contexts to make best use of their potential to create stakeholder value and to avoid unintended negative impacts on vulnerable social groups   c  2017 elsevier inc  all rights reserved  
 us macroannouncements and international asset pricing the world capital asset pricing model is the benchmark model in international finance  however  recent research finds that the premium on the world market factor is insignificant  in this paper  we investigate if the world market risk premium is particularly significant on us macroeconomic announcement days  empirically  we apply the methodology to daily country exchange traded funds  our findings suggest that although the world market risk premium is insignificant on nonannouncement days  it is strongly significant on us macroeconomic announcement days  in addition  we find that us monetary policy announcements are the most important macroeconomic announcements to drive the world market risk premium  our findings are consistent with the notion of monetary policy uncertainty and the empirical literature that connects policy uncertainty with systematic risk

 value co creation in web based multisided platforms  a conceptual framework and implications for business model design the internet is fertile ground for multisided platforms that articulate the production of goods or the execution of services between third parties  thus relying on value co creation as their core business model mechanism  however  an understanding of co creation that underlies dynamics and implications for business model design and innovation is still dispersed and fragmented along a number of literature streams  this article aims to provide an understanding of the value co creation process in web based multisided platforms  a conceptual framework is proposed based on the combination of an analysis of a comprehensive systematic literature review  interviews with academics and entrepreneurs  and an analysis of secondary data on representative cases of multisided business models based on value co creation  we offer a model of value co creation in multisided platforms and advance a number of propositions regarding value dynamics  including the role of the focal firm in defining and maintaining value creation  propositions  and capture structures with consequences to monetization schemes and actors  contributions and motivations for value co creation  this article contributes to the understanding of the co creation phenomenon  especially in multiple actor interaction regimes  and raises a number of suggestions for future research   c  2017 kelley school of business  indiana university  published by elsevier inc  all rights reserved  
 value creation in cross border acquisitions  the role of outside directors  human and social capital do outside directors influence the performance of cross border acquisitions  we use resource dependence arguments and a sample of 431 relatively large cross border acquisitions undertaken by u s  firms to explore how the human and social capital of outside directors on the acquiring firm s board influence shareholder value creation  findings indicate that human and social capital linked to board tenure  external board appointments  and region specific cross border acquisition experience  but not target firm industry experience  have an impact on acquiring firms  shareholder value  our study s theoretical and empirical contributions  along with managerial implications  are discussed  
 value relevance of voluntary internal control certification  an information asymmetry perspective internal control certification reduces information uncertainty on the quality of controls and therefore is expected to affect the pricing of equity securities  this study investigates whether chief executive officers   ceos  and chief financial officers   cfos  voluntary certification of internal controls over financial reporting  icfr  is value relevant  using a sample of firms from a unique australian icfr reporting environment  the study finds that voluntary icfr certification is positively associated with share price  moreover  the financial information of icfr certification firms is significantly associated with the share price if they have higher price volatility  bid ask spread and analysts  forecast dispersion  suggesting icfr certification has an incremental effect on the value relevance of financial information for firms operating within a weak information environment  results from the returns model  the change model and differences in the r 2 support that icfr certification is useful to investors  the study informs on the value relevance of icfr reporting outside the united states  
 valuing stakeholder governance  property rights  community mobilization  and firm value research summary  while research has shown that good stakeholder relations increase the value of a firm  less is known about how specific types of stakeholder governance affect firm value  we examine the value of one such governance mechanismcommunity benefits agreements  cbas  signed by firms and local communitiesintended to minimize social conflict that disrupts access to valuable resources  we argue that shareholders evaluate more positively cbas with local communities with strong property rights and histories of institutional action and extra institutional mobilization because these communities are more likely to cause costly disruptions and delays for a firm  we evaluate these arguments by analyzing the cumulative abnormal returns associated with the unexpected announcement of 148 cbas signed between mining companies and local indigenous communities in canada managerial summary  with firms across many industries facing escalating costs associated with social conflict  new tools are emerging to help firms mitigate these risks by seeking the support of the local communities in which they operate  community benefits agreements  cbas  are contracts in which a community provides consent for a new investment in return for tangible benefits  such as local hiring and revenue sharing  we argue that although cbas are costly for the firm  they are particularly valuable when communities can cause costly disruptions and delays for a firm  our study of investor reactions to the announcement of 148 cbas signed between mining companies and local indigenous communities in canada shows that investors value more cbas signed with communities with strong property rights and histories of protest  copyright  c  2017 john wiley   sons  ltd  
 varieties of csr  institutions and socially responsible behaviour a central concern within contemporary socio economics has been on the relationship between national institutional configurations and societal outcomes  in this paper  we assess the relationship between legal origin and a range of correlated indicators of social responsibility  focusing on socially responsible investing and voluntary charitable giving  we found that in common law contexts  lower levels of social responsibility than in civil law contexts  other than in the area of charitable giving  where the converse was the case  we explore the reasons for this distinction  and for the different patterns encountered in post socialist central and eastern europe  based on the findings  we identify directions for future research  
 venture capital and innovation strategies venture capital investors are specialized financial intermediaries that provide funding for technological innovation with the goal of realizing a capital gain within a few years  we are the first to examine the association of venture capital funding with a company s choice of innovation strategies  we employ a unique data set of over 10 000 innovative dutch companies  some of which received venture financing  the data include detailed information on patent applications  innovation activities  and other company characteristics  we find that companies backed by venture capital focus on the buildup of absorptive capacity by engaging in both in house r d and in the acquisition of external knowledge  companies that receive public funding  instead  are able to relax their financing constraints and perform more innovation activities without focusing solely on absorptive capacity  our results also suggest that the correlation between venture capital funding and the build up of absorptive capacity is not only due to a selection effect  we derive implications of these findings for corporate strategy and public policy  
 volatility forecasting of non ferrous metal futures  covariances  covariates or combinations  this is the first comprehensive study on the forecasting of the realized volatility of nonferrous metal futures  based on 8 5 years of intraday data on copper  zinc  nickel  lead and aluminum  we explore a variety of extensions of the univariate heterogeneous autoregressive  har  model and seek to harness the economic linkages among these metals to improve forecasts  a simple approach that augments the models with shocks in other metals  series appears to outperform more sophisticated specifications  which explicitly model covariances  the results suggest that the information inherent in the volatility series of aluminum is most useful in enhancing the accuracy of forecasts for other metals  while consistently outperforming the original har model with an individual model is difficult  combination forecasts  especially with univariate specifications or bayesian model averaging  are found to conclusively outperform the benchmark   c  2017 elsevier b v  all rights reserved

 wait and see strategy  risk management in the internationalization process model we interpret the wait and see strategy as a decision to maintain unchanged the firm s commitments to its business network relationships  to explain why firms choose a wait and see strategy  we propose an extension to the relationship commitment decisions aspect of the uppsala internationalization process  ip  model  with this development  we explain that the wait and see strategy can result from a change in the levels of risk assumed in the firm and not only from the decision to adjust the risk that the firm encounters by changing commitments to its network relationships  this development enhances the ability of the ip model to accommodate contextual influences on relationship commitment decisions and to explain a more complete suite of internationalization trajectories  extending the theoretical core of the ip model further confirms its efficacy  its application to international strategy  and its potential to be developed as a general process model of strategic change  
 walmart s emergent low cost sustainable product strategy this article traces the strategic initiatives that walmart undertook over the last decade to implement its ambitious vision of selling more sustainable products  this effort has been characterized by a gradual shift away from customer facing initiatives aimed at labeling sustainable products toward supplier facing initiatives targeted at improving environmental or social performance without raising customer prices  it highlights the role of institutional intermediaries  transaction costs  and experiential learning in shaping firms  capabilities to translate ambitious sustainability goals into operable  mass market initiatives  
 war and economy  rediscovering the eighteenth century military entrepreneur the detrimental effects traditionally assigned to warfare in the development of pre industrial economies have obscured the prominent role that military entrepreneurs played in economic development in this period  historiography minimises the extent to which war and the concomitant strengthening of the central state provided a whole new range of opportunities for capital investment  a tendency that has been strengthened by the paradigm of redlich s decline of the soldier entrepreneur  and the technological determinism of the debate on the military revolution among others  the aim of this introduction is to look into the background of this relative lack of interest and to reaffirm the mutual dependence of eighteenth century state formation and the business of war  
 war contracting and artillery production in spain this article is part of a special issue on the relation between war and military enterprises in the long eighteenth century  the focus is on artillery as a military enterprise providing for the needs of the army and the navy  the paper shows the difficulties faced by spain in producing guns  cast iron and bronze   the structure of ownership of firms  the nature of production systems  and scarcity of funding and technological shortcomings are considered  the state turned to monopolistic practices from the 1760s onwards but this change did not produce significant technological change  contrary to expectations  wars did not stimulate production in the long run  from the early years of nineteenth century  the sector found itself overwhelmed by military invasion  financial crisis  and the decline of naval demand  together  these factors caused the collapse of gun production

 was the economics of information approach wrong all the way  evidence from german grocery r e tailing the economics of information approach suggests that as online retailing matures  information asymmetry will enforce the reduction of price dispersion online as providers will operate in conditions close to perfect competition  the internet has already become a part of our life and shopping experience  in germany  over 20  of all electronic  media and leisure related products are bought online  the role of digital channels is expected to increase further  especially in the latecomer sectors  grocery retailing is one of such sectors still in the making and the share of online players in retail revenues is expected to grow drastically by 2020  since online food retailing has not been studied thoroughly and little is known about price levels and dispersion between online and offline markets  our study fills this gap by showing that despite the theoretical predictions price dispersion exist both between online and offline grocery providers as well as across online retailers  
 water scarcity and rioting  disaggregated evidence from sub saharan africa it is often purported that unusually dry weather conditions provoke small scale social conflict riots by intensifying the competition for water  the present paper explores this hypothesis  using data from sub saharan africa  we rely on monthly data at the cell level  0 5 x 0 5 degrees   an approach that is tailored to the short lived and local nature of the phenomenon  using a drought index to proxy for weather shocks  we find that a one standard deviation fall in the index  signaling drier conditions  raises the likelihood of riots in a given cell and month by 8 3   we further observe that the effect of unusually dry weather conditions is substantially larger in cells with a lower availability of water resources  such as rivers and lakes   a finding that supports the significance of the competition for water mechanism   c  2017 elsevier inc  all rights reserved  
 weight loss through virtual support communities  a role for identity based motivation in public commitment individuals increasingly participate in virtual support communities  vscs  where they conduct numerous aspects of their lives with others whom they may never encounter in person  and they interact within these communities to attain various goals  research finds that individuals are more likely to achieve success with such goals when they make a public commitment to achieving them  through our netnographic inquiry  we extend prior theorizing of vsc with an explanation of how public commitment manifests in vsc in support of goal attainment  more specifically  we find these online communities make salient a context relevant social identity which motivates behaviors that facilitate compliance to the public commitment  and hence  more effective goal pursuit  in addition  we create a typology of member roles within these vsc that further influence public commitment  our findings contribute to theories of vsc and public commitment   c  2017 direct marketing educational foundation  inc  dba marketing edge  all rights reserved  
 what affects innovation more  policy or policy uncertainty  motivated by a theoretical model  we examine for 43 countries whether it is policy or policy uncertainty that affects technological innovation more  innovation activities  measured by patent based proxies  are not  on average  affected by which policy is in place  innovation activities  however  drop significantly during times of policy uncertainty measured by national elections  the drop is greater for more influential innovations  citations in the right tail  exploratory rather than exploitative innovations  and for innovation intensive industries  we use close presidential elections and ethnic fractionalization to address endo geneity concerns  we uncover the mechanism underlying the main result by showing that the number of patenting inventors decreases with policy uncertainty  political compromise  we conclude  encourages innovation  
 what corporate governance can learn from catholic social teaching this reflection focuses on what insights catholic social teaching  cst  can provide for corporate governance  i argue that the  standard  agency theory is overly reductionist and insufficiently incorporates important economic limitations  such as asymmetric information  incomplete contracts  and the need for coordination  as well as human frailty  as a result  such agency theory insufficiently distinguishes firms from markets  which can easily relativize how we treat others and facilitate rationalization of unethical behavior  i then explore how three pillars of cst human dignity  solidarity  and subsidiarity can help overcome these limitations  cst proposes a vision of the business corporation as a community of persons  working together in cooperative business relationships toward the shared purpose of contributing to human flourishing  
 what determines horizontal merger antitrust case selection  u s  antitrust agencies claim their antitrust enforcement mission is to protect consumers  promote fair competition  and maintain efficiency  are antitrust practices consistent with this claim  we explore this question by examining antitrust selection of horizontal merger cases in the u s  manufacturing sector during 1980 2009  we find that antitrust agencies are more likely to intervene when foreign import pressure is low  merger industry concentration hits a hurdle level  or local or less specialized rivals suffer unfavorable wealth effects  we find no evidence that antitrust agencies systematically respond to the wealth effects of either customers in general or more affected customers  our findings can be a useful reference for calibrating the efficiency of antitrust regulation and enforcement   c  2017 elsevier b v  all rights reserved  
 what do stock price levels tell us about the firms  we hypothesize that high stock price levels impede informed trading on the stocks and reduce price informativeness  this is because uninformed trading is needed to facilitate informed trading  and high stock prices may impose budget constraints on uninformed investors  indeed  we find  for high price firms   i  options to stock trading volume  o s   an informed trading measure in options market  is higher   ii  price informativeness about future earnings is lower  and  iii  investment sensitivity to price is lower  we also find these patterns reverse after stock splits  suggesting that firms can use splits to improve informed trading and enhance price informativeness   c  2017 elsevier b v  all rights reserved  
 what drives business model adaptation  the impact of opportunities  threats and strategic orientation business models change as managers not only innovate business models  but also engage in more mundane adaptation in response to external changes  such as changes in the level or composition of demand  however  little is known about what causes such business model adaptation  we employ threat rigidity as well as prospect theory to examine business model adaptation in response to external threats and opportunities  additionally  drawing on the behavioural theory of the firm  we argue that the past strategic orientation of a firm creates path dependencies that influence the propensity of the firm to adapt its business model  we test our hypotheses on a sample of 1196 norwegian companies  and find that firms are more likely to adapt their business model under conditions of perceived threats than opportunities  and that strategic orientation geared towards market development is more conducive to business model adaptation than an orientation geared towards defending an existing market position   c  2016 elsevier ltd  all rights reserved  
 what drives housing markets  fundamentals or bubbles  this study applies the dynamic gordon growth model which is in the circumstance of rational bubbles to decompose log price rent ratio into three parts  i e   rational bubbles  discounted expected future rent growth rates and discounted expected future returns  the latter two terms represent housing fundamentals  the magnitudes of the components of price rent ratio s variance are estimated to distinguish the relative impact of the three parts on housing prices  using time series data from the housing markets in the four largest cities in china  1991 q1 2011 q1 for shanghai  guangzhou and shenzhen  1993 q2 2011 q1 for beijing   this paper presents a number of empirical findings   a  the variance of rational bubbles is much larger than the variance of price rent ratio  and rational bubbles contribute more fluctuations directly to price rent ratio than the expected returns or the expected rent growth rates do   b  the covariance between rational bubbles and expected returns or expected rent growth rates is also large   c  the positive covariance of rational bubbles and expected returns implies that high expected returns coexist with bubbles  which differs from previous findings that lower expected returns drive asset prices   d  the negative covariance of rational bubbles and expected rent growth rates indicates that the larger the bubbles are  the lower the expected rent growth rates are   e  the positive covariance of expected returns and expected rent growth rates reveals under reaction of the housing markets to rents  
 what drives ict adoption by smes  evidence from a large scale survey in greece the purpose of this paper is to identify potential determinants of ict adoption in smes  particular emphasis is placed on the role of firms  technological competencies  human capital of workforce and internal organization in ict adoption measured by five indicators referring to firms  intentions toward ict implementation  ict infrastructure  internet integration  e sales and e ptocurement  to this end  a particularly rich dataset is utilized based on a large scale survey on 3500 greek smes  estimations of ordered probit models show that innovation and r d activities and collaborations  well educated and skilled workers  decentralized decision making and visionary leadership increase the likelihood of adopting new technologies in smes  the results appear to be largely robust across different ict adoption measures  
 what drives insurer participation and premiums in the federally facilitated marketplace  we investigate determinants of market entry and premiums within the context of the affordable care act s marketplaces for individual insurance  using bresnahan and reiss  1991  as the conceptual framework  we study how competition and firm heterogeneity relate to premiums in 36 states using federally facilitated or supported marketplaces in 2016  our primary data source is the qualified health plan landscape file  augmented with market characteristics from the american community survey and area health resource file as well as insurer level information from federal medical loss ratio annual reports  we first estimate a model of insurer entry and then investigate the relationship between a market s predicted number of entrants and insurer level premiums  our entry model results suggest that competition is increasing with the number of insurers  most notably as the market size increases from 3 to 4 entrants  results from the premium regression suggest that each additional entrant is associated with approximately 4  lower premiums  controlling for other factors  an alternative explanation for the relationship between entrants and premiums is that more efficient insurers  who can price lower  are the ones that enter markets with many entrants  and this is reflected in lower premiums  an exploratory analysis of insurers  non claims costs  a proxy for insurer efficiency  reveals that average costs among entrants are rising slightly with the number of insurers in the market  this pattern does not support the hypothesis that premiums decrease with more entrants because those entrants are more efficient  suggesting instead that the results are being driven mostly by price competition  
 what drives the cross section of credit spreads   a variance decomposition approach i decompose the variation of credit spreads for corporate bonds into changing expected returns and changing expectation of credit losses  using a log linearized pricing identity and a vector autoregression applied to microlevel data from 1973 to 2011  i find that expected returns contribute to the cross sectional variance of credit spreads nearly as much as expected credit loss does  however  most of the time series variation in credit spreads for the market portfolio corresponds to risk premiums  
 what facilitates dynamic capabilities  the role of organizational climate for trust while dynamic capabilities are important for competitive advantage  the antecedents of dynamic capabilities remain understudied  because dynamic capabilities rely on collective learning and coordinated effort by organization members  the organization s social climate  which shapes patterns in attitudes  behaviors  and interpersonal relationships among organizational members  may be a driver of dynamic capabilities  specifically  employing social exchange and social information processing perspectives  we argue that organizational climate for trust facilitates adaptability and coordination among organization members  and thus enhances the firm s sensing  seizing  and reconfiguring capabilities that in turn affect competitive advantage  utilizing survey data from 209 israeli firms  we find support for our theoretical predictions  however  we also find that climate for trust has a direct relationship with competitive advantage  our study advances understanding of the antecedents of dynamic capabilities by highlighting the importance of organizational climate for trust as a social underpinning of dynamic capabilities and competitive advantage   c  2016 elsevier ltd  all rights reserved  
 what is not beautiful should match  how attractiveness similarity affects consumer responses to advertising this study introduces the concept of attractiveness similarity  empirically examines its main effect and whether it moderates the effect of endorser attractiveness on consumer responses to advertising  the results show a positive main effect of attractiveness similarity over and above the mere effect of endorser attractiveness  in addition  a consistent moderating effect of attractiveness similarity on the effect of endorser attractiveness emerges  attractiveness similarity buffers against the less positive effects of lower levels of endorser attractiveness  i e   it compensates for lower levels of endorser attractiveness   overall  these findings reveal attractiveness similarity as a new variable in endorser advertising  which has important managerial implications  advertising campaigns employing averagely attractive endorsers should pay special attention to attractiveness similarity  
 what is the shareholder wealth impact of target ceo retention in private equity deals  there is a widespread belief among observers that a lower premium is paid when the target ceo is retained by the acquirer in a private equity deal because conflicts of interest lead her to negotiate less aggressively on behalf of the target shareholders  our empirical evidence is not consistent with this belief  we find that  when a private equity acquirer retains the target ceo  target shareholders receive an acquisition premium that is larger by as much as 18  of pre acquisition firm value when accounting for the endogeneity of the retention decision  our evidence is consistent with what we call the  valuable ceo hypothesis   with this hypothesis  retention of the ceo can be valuable to private equity acquirers because  unlike public operating companies with managers in place  these acquirers have to find a ceo to run the post acquisition company and the incumbent ceo may be the best choice to do so because she has valuable firm specific human capital  when a private equity acquirer finds a target with a ceo who can manage the post acquisition company better than other potential ceos  we expect target shareholders to receive a larger premium because the post acquisition value of the target is higher   c  2017 elsevier b v  all rights reserved  
 what makes a website relational  the experts  viewpoint around the world  companies have launched an abundance of websites to reinforce their links with customers  while these websites include relational features  e g   communities and areas for regular visitors  electronic bulletin boards  forums  and rss feeds   can they be considered relational according to the relationship marketing paradigm  to answer this question  we conduct a qualitative study with 19 internet experts  the results show that two approaches can be used to define a relational website  the first approach suggests that a website s relationship proneness  wrp  is driven by three dimensions  content  exchange  and look and feel  the second approach is enumerative  the more electronic customer relationship management  ecrm  features a website offers  the more relational it is considered to be  managerial and theoretical implications lie in the complementary relationship between these two approaches   c  2016 elsevier ltd  all rights reserved  
 what makes population perception of review helpfulness  an information processing perspective what makes online consumer reviews  ocrs  helpful to consumers has been an important issue to academics and practitioners  in this paper  we explicate the moderation role of the reviewer s similarity to the vocal population on the relationship between review characteristics and population perceived review helpfulness from an information processing perspective  vocal population refers to those community members who regularly post and read ocrs  respond to other users  posts  and evaluate other ocrs  we purposively focus on two types of similarity  i e   linguistic style similarity and expertise similarity  the empirical results indicate that the two dimensions of similarity play different roles in shaping population perceptions of review helpfulness  specifically  linguistic style similarity positively moderates the impact of review valence and review length on review helpfulness  while expertise similarity negatively moderates the effect of review valence and review length on review helpfulness  we also discuss the theoretical and managerial implications of our findings  
 what should a manager like me do in a situation like this  strategies for handling ethical problems from the viewpoint of the logic of appropriateness in this research  we argue that managers have various strategies for handling complex ethical problems and that these strategies are formed according to the logic of appropriateness  first  we will show through a qualitative empirical study the different strategies that are used for handling ethical problems  five types of strategies are identified in this study  mediating  principled  isolation  teaching and bystanding  secondly  we will investigate the types of ethical approaches which managers reveal when handling ethical problems  thirdly  we will discuss which strategies seem to contribute to the overall ethicality of organisations  to conclude  we suggest that the decisions and actions of managers like the middle managers in this study are influenced by their interpretation of what is appropriate behaviour in the particular situation  
 what sparks ethical decision making  the interplay between moral intuition and moral reasoning  lessons from the scholastic doctrine recent theories on cognitive science have stressed the significance of moral intuition as a counter to and complementary part of moral reasoning in decision making  thus  the aim of this paper is to create an integrated framework that can account for both intuitive and reflective cognitive processes  in order to explore the antecedents of ethical decision making  to do that  we build on scholasticism  an important medieval school of thought from which descends the main pillars of the modern catholic social doctrine  particularly  the focus will be on the scholastic concept of synderesis  which is an innate human faculty that constantly inclines decision makers toward universal moral principles  managerial implications are discussed  stressing how a rediscovery of decision makers  intuitive moral judgments could be relevant in the reflective thinking practice of managers  ethical reasoning  thus saving them from rational insensitivity to ethical dilemmas  
 when and why do social resources influence employee advocacy  the role of personal investment and perceived recognition integrating social exchange  set  and conservation of resources  cor  theories  this research investigates whether employees  personal resource investment in commitment and effort  mediate the relationships between social resources  i e   co workers  and supervisors  support  and employee advocacy behaviors  in addition  whether such indirect effects are contingent on the boundary condition of perceived recognition  we test the model using data of employees of a large health insurance company in australia  structural equation modeling  sem  results showed commitment and effort mediate the relationships between co workers  and supervisors  support and advocacy  moderated mediation results showed that the indirect effect of commitment is stronger between co workers  support and supervisors  support with advocacy  when perceived recognition is low  in contrast  the indirect effect of effort is stronger between co workers  support and supervisors  support with advocacy when perceived recognition is high  findings of this study advance theoretical development of employee advocacy behaviors  and help managers design supportive work environments  
 when are influentials equally influenceable  the strength of strong ties in new product adoption we study the relationship between opinion leadership and susceptibility to social influence in new product adoption and how this relationship varies with tie strength in social networks  data analysis based on a sociometric survey indicates that opinion leaders are less sensitive to informational influence than non leaders  furthermore  individuals with moderate levels of leadership are more susceptible to normative influence than individuals with high or low levels of leadership  we also find evidence of the moderating effect of tie strength  while opinion leaders are less susceptible to informational influence from weak tie peers  they are equally sensitive to informational influence from strong tie peers as non leaders  more interestingly  the inverse u relationship between self reported leadership and normative influence holds for strong ties  whereas this pattern between sociometric leadership and normative influence holds for weak ties  these findings have implications for better understanding how social influence operates over social networks in new product adoption  
 when can humble top executives retain middle managers  the moderating role of top management team faultlines top management in organizations must effectively retain middle managers  mms who are central linking pins in strategy processes as loss of their human and social capital can threaten strategy implementation  while long envisioning how leaders motivate subordinates to stay  management scholars have largely neglected how teams in which leaders belong  e g   top management teams  tmt   constitute an organizational context that moderates their ability to retain subordinates  building on recent theory and research that a leader s humility discourages subordinates from voluntarily departing by increasing their job satisfaction  we propose that faultlines in tmts can exert cross level effects attenuating how humble executives sustain mms  job satisfaction  and how mms  job dissatisfaction drives their voluntary turnover  we verify these effects with a multisource  multiphase dataset of 43 tmts  313 top executives  and 502 mms  our study thus bridges the macro and micro divide to offer a multilevel inquiry into contextual influences on voluntary turnover  identifies a boundary condition for leader humility effects  and clarifies how tmt faultlines represent a contextual constraint on how top executives induce mm subordinates to stay

 when do structural holes in employees  networks improve their radical creativity  a moderated mediation model previous research has found a relationship between structural holes of knowledge networks  tie strength of knowledge networks  and creativity  our study extends these findings by proposing that characteristics of r d employees  team knowledge networks influence their acquired diversified knowledge from the team  which is critical to creativity  our results based on 558 members of 92 r d teams demonstrated that  in order to benefit from their broker position in acquiring diversified knowledge  r d employees should maintain their tie strength toward the team members with whom they are connected  
 when does corporate social responsibility reduce employee turnover  evidence from attorneys before and after 9 11 this study places important boundary conditions on the generally accepted notion that csr will reduce turnover  our primary argument is that csr will be most effective at reducing turnover that is motivated by a preference for more meaningfulness at work  we find empirical support for this idea using microdata on attorneys employed by large law firms  we find that firms with higher levels of csr have moderately lower rates of turnover to startup law firms and turnover through occupation changes  moves which are more likely to be motivated by a preference for meaningfulness than moves to nonstartup law firms  strikingly  the retention benefits of csr are much stronger after attorneys experience mortality related shocks that likely cause them to reevaluate their jobs  i e   for new york city born attorneys following the 9 11 terror attacks   to our surprise  we also find that firms with higher levels of csr experience higher turnover rates to nonstartup law firms  in addition to our arguments about the importance of meaningfulness  the study provides two important extensions to work examining csr and turnover   1  it may be useful to view the csr turnover relationship through a risk management lens  and  2  investments in csr may increase employee departures from organizations under certain conditions  
 when does customer oriented leadership pay off  an investigation of frontstage and backstage service teams the service literature highlights the importance of organizational leaders in creating an organization wide customer orientation  co   yet  some open questions remain regarding this relationship  are organizational leaders from different hierarchical levels equally effective in creating a co  does the functional role of employees affect the importance of certain leaders  more generally  when does customer oriented leadership really pay off  to address these questions  we investigate how senior managers  and direct supervisors  co affects the co climate and effectiveness of both frontstage and backstage service teams  analyzing multisource data from 575 employees and their supervisors from 110 teams in a retail bank  we find that the effect of perceived senior manager co on team co climate and team effectiveness is stronger in backstage teams while perceived direct supervisor co has a greater influence on frontstage teams  moreover  team co climate consensus moderates the effect of team co climate on team effectiveness  these results suggest that  contrary to past theorizing  customer oriented leadership does not per se increase team co climate and team effectiveness  rather  the correct coupling of leadership source and degree of customer contact needs to be achieved  service managers should use these findings and appoint the correct leader to implement co to make the organization wide co diffusion more efficient and effective  
 when does it pay to be good  moderators and mediators in the corporate sustainability corporate financial performance relationship  a critical review in this paper  we review the literature on moderators and mediators in the corporate sustainability  cs  corporate financial performance  cfp  relationship  we provide some clarity on what has been learned so far by taking a contingency perspective on this much researched relationship  overall  we find that this research has made some progress in the past  however  we also find this research stream to be characterized by three major shortcomings  namely low degree of novelty  missing investment in theory building  and a lack of research design and measurement options  to address these shortcomings  we suggest avenues for future research  beyond that we also argue for a stronger emphasis on the strategic perspective of cs  in particular  we propose future research to take a step back and aim for an integration of the cs cfp relationship into the strategic management literature  
 when elites forget their duties  the double edged sword of prestigious directors on boards previous research indicates that the performance effect of prestigious directors is ambiguous  our study addresses this issue by integrating the theoretical lens of board capital and the institutional perspective  we argue that prestigious directors can bring benefits as well as costs  we claim that the emergence of these costs depends on the institutional context  specifically the institutional characteristics of the country s corporate elite circle which is characterized by the elite cohesion and the elite exclusiveness  our empirical results with a 15 country sample covering the period of 2005 to 2014 provide evidence for the overall existence of a positive performance effect of prestigious boards  however  our results also indicate that these beneficial effects of prestigious boards are mitigated in countries with high elite exclusiveness  hence  under these certain institutional conditions  the elite favouring behaviour of prestigious directors also brings costs

 which competitive advantage s   competitive advantage market performance relationships in international markets business scholars and managers stress the importance of achieving and sustaining competitive advantage as a critical strategic step in enabling superior firm performance  yet which types of competitive advantage may yield the best performance outcomes and what contingency factorsmay affect this remains largely unexplored  this article examines the contribution of price  product  and service advantages to market performance in international ventures  applying customer value logic to the literature on value creation and value capture  the authors posit that the symmetric achievement of all pairs of advantages leads to increased market performance  the findings confirm this conjecture  while for the product service advantage pairing  even asymmetry in achievement has a positivemarket performance effect when the asymmetry is toward service  using primary data from a sample of u k  manufacturing exporters  the authors find that price advantage has a direct positive effect on market performance  while the strong positive effect of service advantage is further strengthened  and the nonsignificant effect of product advantage becomes negative  when the distributor has high quality relationships with the overseas customers and there is available production capacity  even in technologically turbulent environments  
 who acquires whom among stand alone commercial banks and bank holding company affiliates  this paper presents the difference in the likelihood of being targets or acquirers among stand alone banks  singlebank holding company  sbhc  affiliates and multi bank holding company  mbhc  affiliates  using a sample of u s  commercial bank data from 1997 to 2012  we find that mbhc affiliates exhibit a greater likelihood of being targets than do stand alone commercial banks  while stand alone banks have a greater probability of becoming targets than do sbhc affiliates  our findings show that mbhc affiliates tend to have a greater likelihood of being acquirers than do sbhc affiliates  which again have a greater probability of being acquirers than do stand alone banks  those banks that acquire another bank within the same mbhc structure tend to be smaller and more financially constrained than those banks acquiring outside the same mbhc structure  whereas targets that are acquired by another bank within the same mbhc structure tend to be smaller  higher profitability and capital than targets that are acquired by banks from outside the mbhc structure  our results suggest that the mbhc parent attempts to discipline distressed  poorly performing and smaller affiliates by involving them in mergers and acquisitions   c  2016 elsevier inc  all rights reserved  
 who buys counterfeit luxury brands  a meta analytic synthesis of consumers in developing and developed markets although numerous previous studies have investigated consumer demographics and psychographics as determinants of counterfeit purchases  their findings are diverse and fragmented  in conceptually referring to the brand signals that help consumers build their identities  the present meta analysis synthesizes the influence of consumer demographics and psychographics on attitudes  intentions  and behaviors with regard to branded counterfeit luxury products  it empirically summarizes 610 effect sizes from 98 independent studies and shows that whereas demographics have little impact  some psychographics greatly influence counterfeit purchases  with these influences differing between developed and developing countries  in the former  risk propensity and reduced integrity are stronger determinants of counterfeit purchases and are related to brand signals that refer to identities that consumers attempt to avoid  in developing countries  consumers are more influenced by psychographics  such as status seeking  which are related to positive brand signals for consumer identities  the findings lead to a profile of consumers of counterfeit luxury items that provides guidance for future research and for improved consumer targeting with regard to international anticounterfeiting measures

 who s the boss at the top  a micro level analysis of director expertise  status and conformity within boards in this paper we address how director expertise impacts a director s social status and conformity within the board  our results  derived from two unique multi source datasets of peer ratings on director status and conformity of non executive directors from dutch organizations  indicate that industry specific expertise and financial expertise differently impact directors  social status and influence within the board  we find that directors  individual performance orientation   the motivation to demonstrate expertise   acts as an important contingency for expertise to increase directors  status within the board  additional analyses using archival data and interviews with non executive directors substantiate our findings and provide additional insight into the dynamics operating within boards  this study extends existing research on boards of directors and provides unique micro level insights into the boardroom dynamics that connect director expertise to director status and conformity within boards  
 why are foreclosures contagious  this article investigates the mechanism by which foreclosed properties depress neighboring property prices  using a novel dataset on housing capital expenditure  i verify as accurate the claim of disinvestment theory made in earlier studies  when capital expenditure investment  neighborhood price trends  number of multiple listing service listings and neighborhood fixed effects are controlled for  the negative effect on property prices is significant from nearby foreclosures  real estate owned  reo  listings and reo sales  but not from default and delinquent properties  the effect is larger in a depressed market than in an appreciating market  i argue that the most plausible explanation for these results is that a foreclosure discount drives down the reference prices for nearby properties and depresses neighborhood values  this discount information is revealed to the public through foreclosures  reo listings and reo sales  
 why bad things happen to good organizations  the link between governance and asset diversions in public charities in the united states  the irs now requires charities to publicly disclose any significant asset diversion  which is the theft or unauthorized use of assets  that the charity identifies during the year  we use this new disclosure to investigate whether strong governance reduces the likelihood of a charitable asset diversion  specifically  for a sample of 1528 charities from 2008 to 2012  we simultaneously examine eleven measures of governance that capture four broad governance constructs  board monitoring  independence of key individuals  tone at the top  and capital provider oversight  we find consistent evidence that good governance across all four constructs is negatively associated with the probability of an asset diversion  of the eleven governance measures  our results indicate that monitoring by debt holders and government grantors  audits  and keeping managerial duties in house are most strongly associated with lower incidence of fraud  our results also indicate that the likelihood of a fraud is negatively associated with a board review of the form 990  the existence of a conflict of interest policy  and the presence of restricted donations  in addition  we document that the likelihood of an asset diversion is negatively associated with program efficiency and positively associated with growth and organizational complexity  
 why do fund managers identify and share profitable ideas  we study data from an organization in which fund managers privately share and discuss detailed investment recommendations  buy recommendations generate positive abnormal returns  and sell recommendations result in negative abnormal returns  in the context of these results  we explore an important economic question  why do skilled investors share profitable ideas with others  evidence suggests that the managers in our sample share to receive feedback on their ideas and to attract additional arbitrageur capital to the securities they recommend in order to correct mispricings  
 why does aggregate earnings growth reflect information about future inflation  we propose two explanations for the previously documented relation between aggregate earnings growth and future inflation  one based on firms changing their investment in response to earnings growth  and the other based on consumers varying their consumption in response to wealth effects of profitability growth  as the supply of goods and services is relatively inelastic in the short run  our arguments imply that changes to near term demand for investment  consumption  will affect the prices of investment  consumption  goods and services  consistent with the investment based argument  we find that profitability changes predict investment and producer price index  ppi  shifts in subsequent quarters  our analyses also reveal that aggregate earnings growth predicts future investment and ppi forecast errors  we find  at best  weak evidence for the consumption based link between aggregate earnings growth and future inflation  
 why does mne performance vary across countries  an inquiry into the competitive value of mne assets variations in mnes  competitive positions across countries are a prevalent phenomenon in the business landscape  but are not fully explained by mne theory  building on competition theories and applying them to the context of mnes  we hypothesize that the value of mnes  assets varies in relation to competitors of different nationalities and geographic scope  as well as across locations  these predictions are tested on us legal services mnes in competition with us domestic firms and non us mnes in the us and abroad  we find support for the hypothesized variations  particularly with reference to competitors  location and nationality  these variations suggest that the value of mne assets is relative  and that their varying market positions across countries are an inherent feature of international competition  calling for corresponding positioning and strategies  
 why some south asian muslims celebrate christmas  introducing  acculturation trade offs  research studying religious observance and marketplace interaction in different cultural settings focuses either on the dominant religious group s consumption rituals or religious minorities  own religious consumption rituals  however  research has not explored how religious minority groups celebrate dominant religious holidays  this study explores how muslims living in britain apply religiosity to mediate engaging with christmas celebrations  we argue these interactions must be understood from a religious  cultural and market generated perspective  our findings indicate that participants encounter tensions surrounding their engagement with celebrations mediated through their islamic religious principles  by recognizing this behavior  we introduce the term  acculturation trade offs  describing how individuals reject  compromise  or submerse themselves in an others  behavior  this behavior involves a personal evaluation of the costs and benefits of engagement  
 will the consistent organic food consumer step forward  an empirical analysis the organic food market has reached a significant value in developed countries  but market shares vary substantively between product categories  this article investigates general patterns in the sequence of adoption of organic products based on a major danish retailer s panel scanner data  all registered transactions over 20 months from 8 704 randomly selected customers with a loyalty card are analyzed using a hidden markov model  capturing the dynamics in consumers  purchases  the model identifies latent states representing identifiable  accessible  and actionable dynamic customer segments  and captures the movements between states or segments  a pattern emerges that is consistent with the theory of behavioral spillover and inconsistent with the theory of moral licensing  including a tendency to buy organic products in an increasing number of product categories over time  the order in which organic products are adopted is inversely related to the behavioral costs of adopting them  the employed approach provides a firm basis for personalized communication aiming to increase cross selling of organic products  increase the sale of less popular organic products  and accelerate movements from segments buying few organic products to segments buying organic more consistently  
 will you run it  a gatekeeping experiment examining credibility  branding  and affiliation within information subsidies information subsidies from military and civilian public relations practitioners receive varying degrees of acceptance by media gatekeepers  using an experimental design  this study examined organizational affiliation within media gatekeeping  television news decision makers were randomlyassigned one of five mock live news reports with only the reporter s clothing and on air title manipulated  results indicated affiliation did not affect gatekeeper use  higher credibility was attributed to spokespersons with no organizational affiliation  and to military practitioners over civilians  
 winding paths  ambivalence in consumers  buying processes this paper investigates ambivalence in the buying process  the existing literature has rarely studied ambivalence in longitudinal processes and has therefore not been able to capture its dynamics  those studies that have studied ambivalence longitudinally have focused on general attitudinal ambivalence rather than its subtypes  cognitive  affective  and intercomponent ambivalence  and have therefore ignored some of the more detailed dynamics  hence  this study addresses these different types of ambivalence longitudinally  exploring what these different ambivalences consist of  what their roles are in the buying process  and how they occur under different types of involvement conditions  a longitudinal video diary method is used in conjunction with a multimodal analysis technique to explore not only the verbally expressed aspects of ambivalence but also its nonverbal expression  which further reveals differences between different types of ambivalence  the findings suggest that cognitive ambivalence involves conflicting evaluations of utilitarian brand and product aspects and is resolved through more effortful mechanisms  whereas intercomponent ambivalence involves conflicting evaluations of varying utilitarian  hedonic  and symbolic brand and product aspects and is resolved through both more and less effortful mechanisms  finally  affective ambivalence involves conflicting anticipations about the outcome of the buying process but is not resolved through similarly clear mechanisms  as the key outcome of the exploration  propositions and a synthesising framework about the different types of ambivalence in the buying process are developed for future research  this paper hence contributes to the ambivalence literature and offers managerial implications especially for marketers of multifaceted and high involvement products

 within firm pay inequality financial regulators and investors have expressed concerns about high pay inequality within firms  using a proprietary data set of public and private firms  this paper shows that firms with higher pay inequality relative wage differentials between top and bottom level jobs are larger and have higher valuations and stronger operating performance  moreover  firms with higher pay inequality exhibit larger equity returns and greater earnings surprises  suggesting that pay inequality is not fully priced by the market  our results support the notion that differences in pay inequality across firms are a reflection of differences in managerial talent  
 words are not all created equal  a new measure of ecb communication we develop a field specific dictionary to measure the stance of the european central bank  ecb  monetary policy  dovish  neutral  hawkish  and the state of the eurozone economy  positive  neutral  negative  through the content of ecb press conferences  in contrast with traditional textual analysis  we propose a novel approach using term weighting and contiguous sequence of words  n grams  to better capture the subtlety of central bank communication  we find that quantifying ecb communication using our field specific weighted lexicon helps to explain future ecb monetary decisions when considering an augmented taylor rule  regarding european stock market volatility  we find that markets are more  less  volatile on the day following a conference with a negative  positive  tone about the euro area economic outlook  our indicators significantly outperform a textual classification based on the loughran mcdonald or apel blix grimaldi dictionaries and a mediabased measure of economic policy uncertainty   c  2017 elsevier ltd  all rights reserved  
 words versus deeds  evidence from post call manager trades we examine the impact of conference call tones on the direction and magnitude of subsequent manager trades  our univariate results show that corporate insiders buy company shares following negative tone conference calls and sell shares following positive tone conference calls  this inverse call tone trading pattern holds for both managers  introductory sessions and subsequent question and answer  q a  sessions  our multivariate results confirm the univariate call tone trading patterns and show that contrarian manager trades are mostly driven by managerial selling activity  in contrast to the consistent and strong evidence of managers trading in the opposite direction of their call tones  we find no evidence of managers trading in the same direction of their call tones  we also examine the impact of analyst q a challenges on post call manager trades  our findings suggest that managers learn from analyst feedback and adjust their post call trades accordingly  
 yours  mine  and ours  a user centric analysis of opportunities and challenges in peer to peer asset sharing the sharing economy is growing globally in terms of user numbers  service providers  and novel concepts  peer to peer  p2p  asset sharing  or asset rental between private individuals  has attracted the attention of entrepreneurs and researchers alike  p2p asset sharing networks need to focus on two distinct customer groups   1  asset owners willing to rent out their assets  and  2  renters interested in renting others  assets  despite consumers  high interest in p2p asset sharing  participation rates lag projections  which is mainly attributable to lack of participating asset owners  this could be problematic for p2p networks as they do not own assets  instead  they rely on a sufficient number of asset owners to participate  detailed indications on the participation motives of users are required to distinctly position p2p asset sharing and enhance communication of consumer relevant benefits  to this end  we have engaged in a detailed investigation of participation motives in the p2p car sharing context  we have conducted in depth interviews with car owners and renters to derive usage types that represent consumer decision profiles that participate in p2p car sharing services  based on our findings  we provide extensive recommendations to entrepreneurs in the p2p asset sharing market   c  2017 kelley school of business  indiana university  published by elsevier inc  all rights reserved
