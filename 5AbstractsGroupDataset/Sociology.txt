  are you tough enough   performing gender in the uk leadership debates 2015 1 leaders  debates have become a feature of contemporary election campaigning  while an historical feature of the us landscape  in the united kingdom  they are a more recent phenomenon  the second uk 2015 general election leadership debate comprised seven candidates  of which three were women  using qualitative thematic analysis and adopting the notion that gender is performed   we explore three features of coverage of the debate  first  the ways in which the debate itself was constructed as a masculine activity through a series of highly gendered metaphors  second  how newspaper frames reinforced gendered notions of masculinity and femininity in respect of political leadership  and third  how the success of women in the debates was constructed as the emasculation of their male rivals  crucially  we focus not just on the feminisation  of women in the political arena  but also on the ways in which masculinity is posited as the criterion for the evaluation of politicians of all genders  1 
 2 1 because even us  arabs  now speak english    syrian refugee teachers  investment in english as a foreign language  framed within darvin and norton s  2015  model of investment  this study examined a group of syrian refugee teachers  ideologies and challenges regarding teaching english as a foreign language  efl  to syrian refugee students with interrupted or no prior formal education in three non formal education  nfe  centers in lebanon  a qualitative approach using interview data alongside field observations and questionnaire responses was employed to gain a nuanced understanding of the teachers  experiences  findings from this study suggest that teachers acknowledged the importance of teaching english to their students and did so despite a host of curricular  linguistic  sociolinguistic  and sociocultural obstacles  we suggest that when teachers of refugee students in education in emergency  eie  contexts are invested in teaching efl  they can assume an agentive role in devising innovative solutions to problems  
 cycles of change  slaying the badger  the tour de france and contemporary documentary film from its origins in 1903 as a parochial national cycle race  the tour de france is today undeniably among the greatest annual sporting spectacles in the world  since 1954 it has systematically extended its appeal beyond france s national borders  regularly staging a grand depart from other european cities  the tour de france also attracts an estimated 12 million spectators lining the route over the race s 3 week duration every year  is watched by a reputed 1 5 billion global television audience across more than 188 countries and  therefore  is implicitly involved in a complex production of transnational discourses about sport  this article analyzes the 2014 espn documentary slaying the badger and proposes a reading which situates the representation of greg lemond  the first and  to date  only officially recognized american to win the tour de france  and his turbulent rivalry with teammate and mentor french cyclist bernard hinault within wider social contexts  focusing on the discourse of americanization  the article also critically examines the meanings of socioeconomic forces that began to transform not only the international composition of the peloton but also the cultural significance of the tour de france from the 1980s onward  
  distinctiveness  and the bbc  a new battleground for public service television  1 uk government led consultations over the renewal of the bbc s charter  and the new 2017 charter itself  have foregrounded the distinctiveness  of the bbc s output  especially in popular entertainment television  focusing on these debates and proposals  this article considers the value of distinctiveness when applied to bbc television  identifying definitions of the term and its history  or lack of it  in previous debates about the british broadcasting system  it discusses the implications of proposed systems for measuring distinctiveness quantitatively  it examines why the publicly funded  not for profit model of broadcasting might be expected to yield more distinctive outputs  yet also detects the spectre of concerns about the bbc s market impact to be present in the background of these debates  in relation both to the production of entertainment content and to its scheduling  the article argues that the domestic and global economic and cultural benefits arising from the bbc s potential for creating distinctive  programming should outweigh concerns about market impact  it also concludes that distinctiveness  adds little to the bbc s existing service requirements  but risks being used prescriptively and as a weapon with which the bbc s output can constantly be questioned by its critics  1 
 5 1 family matters   ageing and the intergenerational social contract in urban ahmedabad  gujarat  this article aims to understand the complex interactions of family and intergenerational relationships in an emerging city in india  demographic work on population ageing in india has primarily focused on family structure  health outcomes and institutional living  though the focus of these studies has been on the indian family  surprisingly  an in depth study of the complex dialectic of the intergenerational relationships is often missing from the gerontological literature  drawing from in depth qualitative interviews in the city of ahmedabad  gujarat  this article unsettles the assumptions around filial obligation and intergenerational support  in particular  the study shows that the intergenerational social contract is mediated by the economic dependence of the ageing parents on their adult children  our observations lend support to the construct of ambivalence  coexistence of conflict and affection  that is suggested by the dominant social psychological paradigm of intergenerational solidarity conflict  additionally  the article underscores cultural meanings of identity  gender ideology and role continuity among older indians  
 from fizzle to sizzle  televised sports news and the production of gender bland sexism this article draws upon data collected as part of a 25 year longitudinal analysis of televised coverage of women s sports to provide a window into how sexism operates during a postfeminist sociohistorical moment  as the gender order has shifted to incorporate girls  and women s movement into the masculine realm of sports  coverage of women s sports has shifted away from overtly denigrating coverage in 1989 to ostensibly respectful but lackluster coverage in 2014  to theorize this shift  we introduce the concept of gender bland sexism  a contemporary gender framework that superficially extends the principles of merit to women in sports  televised news and highlight shows frame women in uninspired ways  making women s athletic accomplishments appear lackluster compared to those of men s  because this bland language normalizes a hierarchy between men s and women s sports while simultaneously avoiding charges of overt sexism  this article contributes to gender theory by illuminating how women can be marginalized in male dominated  male controlled settings via individualized merit based assessments of talent  
  fundamental causes  of inequalities in mortality  an empirical test of the theory in 20 european populations 1 the fundamental causes  theory stipulates that when new opportunities for lowering mortality arise  higher socioeconomic groups will benefit more because of their greater material and non material resources  we tested this theory using harmonised mortality data by educational level for 22 causes of death and 20 european populations from the period 1980 2010  across all causes and populations  mortality on average declined by 2 49 per cent  95 ci  2 04 2 92   1 83   1 37 2 30  and 1 34   0 89 1 78  per annum among the high  mid and low educated  respectively  in 69 per cent of cases of declining mortality  mortality declined faster among the high than among the low educated  however  when mortality increased  less increase among the high educated was found in only 46 per cent of cases  faster mortality decline among the high educated was more manifest for causes of death amenable to intervention than for non amenable causes  the difference in mortality decline between education groups was not larger when income inequalities were greater  while our results provide support for the fundamental causes theory  our results suggest that other mechanisms than the theory implies also play a role  1 
 8 1 gender utopias     us student reflections on studying abroad in norway and sweden  this article describes a study abroad experience in norway and sweden that was designed to explore gender equality in two of the world s most gender progressive countries  course readings explored the work of feminist sociologists and asked students to think critically about gender equality from a cross cultural perspective  students met with leaders in norway and sweden who are involved in creating gender progressive policy and culture  including members of parliament  representatives in the film industry  and social policy experts  student pre trip and post trip responses to writing prompts and trip reflection journals demonstrated the development of an intersectional approach to thinking about gender equality  while some aspects of gender equality were anticipated before the trip  other issues of equality only became evident through our discussion with gender leaders in scandinavia  this article shares major themes from student reflections and discusses teaching ideas for future study abroad trips  
 gimme a pigfoot and a bottle of beer  food as cultural performance in the aftermath of hurricane katrina in the aftermath of hurricane katrina and the federal levee failures  hundreds of thousands of volunteers went to new orleans to help rebuild  food was quickly used as a way to welcome volunteers  to compensate them for their hard work  to celebrate progress in rebuilding community  and to interact with others  in time  however  the giving and consuming of food was renegotiated  volunteers coming to new orleans expected meals representative of new orleans s foodways  this article looks at the cultural performance of food in the aftermath of hurricane katrina  in particular  i analyze the symbolic exchanges of food in what i call performances of reciprocity and performances of solidarity  this study adds to the burgeoning work in symbolic interaction on food  especially as it pertains to progressive spaces of cultural politics  
 go and do likewise  investigating whether involvement in congregationally sponsored community service activities predicts prosocial behavior some congregations sponsor activities through which people can serve in the community  like serving meals at a soup kitchen or homeless shelter  offering after school programs for neighborhood children  and hosting counseling and support groups  this study investigates whether attenders who are involved in congregationally sponsored community service activities  cscsa  are more likely to engage in forms of prosocial behavior that are not organized or sponsored by their congregation  in doing so  it draws on past literatures about three key predictors of prosocial behavior congregational involvement  religious beliefs and values  and community involvement  results from the 2008 2009 u s  congregational life survey indicate that   1  even when controlling for congregational involvement  religious beliefs and values  and community involvement  involvement in cscsa is positively related to providing social support  charitable giving  civic engagement  and involvement in non congregationally related community organizations   2  involvement in cscsa improves the model fit when predicting these outcomes  these results suggest that   1  despite its similarity to past predictors  involvement in cscsa matters for predicting prosocial behavior  i e   it is more than the sum of the past predictors    2  engaging in prosocial behavior through cscsa may spill over into attenders  everyday lives and encourage them to engage in forms of prosocial behavior that are not organized or sponsored by a congregation  
  handled with care   diffuse policing and the production of inequality in amsterdam 1 the intersection of race and the criminal justice system has been a longstanding topic of activism  public debate and research in the us context  in recent years  european countries have also seen a growing social and academic debate about the way racialized minorities are policed  based on ethnographic research in amsterdam  this article argues that in order to understand such racialized policing  we have to go beyond a narrow focus on the police itself  and instead examine the broader institutional landscape tasked with security  this institutional landscape is made up of penal and welfare actors who together enact what i call diffuse policing  such diffuse policing envelops targeted persons and spaces in a dense web of surveillance  and disciplinary and reform interventions that are hard to escape or challenge  this article explores the cumulative effects of this dense security landscape  and argues that it produces significant inequalities among youths in amsterdam  1 
 12 1 i believe we are the fewer  the prouder    women s agency in meaning making after military sexual assault  this article draws on ethnographic evidence and argues for the theoretical significance of that evidence regarding concepts of personal agency vis a vis rhetorics of victimhood  the problem discussed in this article is that a dominant discourse that positions women primarily or exclusively as victims in response to their experience of sexual assault not only works to re victimize women but imposes unnecessary boundaries on the meaning of these experiences for the women involved  instead of privileging the dominant discourse  this article seeks to privilege the voices of women who have experienced sexual assault  how women make sense of their experiences and themselves is constituted by their discourses  among the many ways women choose to make sense of their experience and  re construct the self is by drawing on the alternative available discourses including their military values and identity  
 i used to be wild  adolescent perspectives on the influence of family  peers  school  and neighborhood on positive behavioral transition public health practice involving adolescents is largely focused on preventing or delaying the initiation of risk behavior  however  given the experimental and exploratory nature of this developmental period  this is often impractical  this article focuses on behavioral transitions and the ways in which youth involved in risk behaviors shift to more promotive behaviors  based on a positive youth development perspective  in depth interviews with urban youth were conducted and analyzed to gain an understanding of the influences on behavior change  specific family support  ability to detach from harmful peer relationships  and school connectedness and vocational support emerged as important to those youths who made a positive behavioral transition  these findings suggest the importance of understanding ways to support the cessation of involvement in risk behaviors and reinforce the significance of contextual influences on youth development  
 i m gay and i m catholic  negotiating two complex identities at a catholic university this article examines the negotiation of sexual and religious identities among gay and lesbian students on a catholic university campus  we explore context specific identity negotiation to determine how and why  even in a time of increasing societal acceptance of sexual minorities  boundaries between faith and sexual identity persist  through participant observation and interviews conducted with gay and lesbian students  we identify and discuss four identity categories based on whether students embrace or reject religious identities and sexual minority identities   1  integrated  embrace both identities    2  liberated  embrace sexual identity  reject religious identity    3  embattled  embrace religious identity  reject sexual identity   and  4  disillusioned  uncertainty about both identities   we demonstrate that support from peers and  re  interpretations of official church doctrine are key factors in the development and negotiation of sexual and religious identities  we conclude by discussing the implications of our research  including specific implications for religious higher education  
 if i can offer you some advice  rapport and data collection in interviews between adults of different ages reflexively analyzing interactions between myself  young adult woman  and 150 adult research participants  i explore how interviewees responded to the interviewer s perceived age in combination with other social identity categories  addressing a gap in scholarship on adult adult interview interactions  this article examines how age gradations  in combination with other axes of similarity or difference  affect researcher interviewee rapport and data acquisition  racial similarity  regardless of age  unlocked access to the topic of race ethnicity  age intersected with gender such that women within a decade of the woman interviewer s age assumed similarity and were communicative  in interviews with similarly aged heterosexual men  awareness of sexuality inhibited answers around intimacy  with older interviewees  gender similarity bridged the age chasm with women  in contrast  age and gender difference inspired older men to act paternalistically and give unsolicited advice  even among adults  interviewees  classification of the interviewer s age contours the interactional dynamic  impacts data acquisition  and reproduces social distinctions  
 if i m going to do it  i m going to do it right  intensive mothering ideologies among childless women who elect egg freezing researchers have documented the dominance of intensive mothering ideologies and their impact on mothers and their families  however  the effect of these ideologies on childless women has received little attention  i draw on interview data to examine the parenting ideologies of childless women with electively frozen eggs  i demonstrate that incorporation of and commitment to intensive mothering ideologies affect fertility decision making among these childless women  i find that concerns about the heavy burdens of intensive motherhood  coupled with unsupportive partners and workplaces  produce ambivalence toward childbearing and a strategy of fertility postponement  i extend the literatures on intensive mothering  reproductive decision making  assisted reproductive technologies  arts   and elective egg freezing by identifying egg freezing as an expression of the gendering of fertility risk and as a means of doing security  participants view egg freezing as a means of managing risk in two primary ways  as a means of securing access to biogenetic motherhood by managing biological risks of infertility and fetal genetic abnormality  and as a means of enabling intensive parenting by managing temporal risks inherent in coordinating careers  relationships  and childbearing  
 it was necessary at the beginning to make this whole revolution  men s attitudes to parental leaves in sweden and poland this article compares and contrasts the attitudes of polish and swedish fathers to individualized or gender neutral parental leaves popularly referred to as daddy quotas  the comparisons of two distinctively different societies that are characterized by very different family policy systems and gender equality policies allow the article to explore how family policies help to shape men s attitudes to parenthood and gendered parenting roles  polish family policy is mother oriented and only recently started to address the social citizenship rights of fathers  polish men s role in the family is still normatively coded in terms of male breadwinning  whereas in sweden  there is a long tradition of gender neutral parental leave and a normative and institutionalized social policy tradition of encouraging fathers into greater engagement with care work  this study shows that institutional contexts  in particular parental leave provisions  impact how men perceive their own parental roles and their own interpretations of prevailing models of masculinities  
 leaving the faith of our fathers  intergenerational persistence and class cleavage of evangelicals in chile several studies have consistently linked the evangelical breakdown in latin america as a mass movement mainly adopted by impoverished working class individuals  however  little is known about how religious inheritance and recruitment of evangelical movements is affected when status conditions improve along individuals trajectories  using bicentenario survey from 2006 to 2010 we analyze how intergenerational patterns of religious persistence in chile relate to individuals  educational attainment and intergenerational mobility  two mechanisms are evaluated  first  the intergenerational persistence of evangelicals compared to catholics and  none s   and second  the probability of conversion or reaffiliation to evangelical protestantism  multinomial regression analysis shows that the greater an individual s educational credentials and upward mobility  the lesser their identification with evangelical movements  regardless of their religious affiliation or educational attainment of origin  this evidence suggests there are obstacles for evangelical movements  vertical mobility  which could be related to chile s strong social cleavage in terms of religion  
  like skydiving without a parachute   how class origin shapes occupational trajectories in british acting 1 there is currently widespread concern that access to  and success within  the british acting profession is increasingly dominated by those from privileged class origins  this article seeks to empirically interrogate this claim using data on actors from the great british class survey  n   404  and 47 qualitative interviews  first  survey data demonstrate that actors from working class origins are significantly underrepresented within the profession  second  they indicate that even when those from working class origins do enter the profession they do not have access to the same economic  cultural and social capital as those from privileged backgrounds  third  and most significantly  qualitative interviews reveal how these capitals shape the way actors can respond to shared occupational challenges  in particular we demonstrate the profound occupational advantages afforded to actors who can draw upon familial economic resources  legitimate embodied markers of class origin  such as received pronunciation  and a favourable typecasting  1 
 20 1 matriliny did not become patriliny    the transformation of thiyya   tharavad  houses in 20 th  century kerala  in contrast to a preoccupation with nayar matriliny  in this article i look at the transformations of matrilineal tharavad houses among the thiyyas who ranked below the nayars in the caste hierarchy and were not generally large landowners  moving away from the more exotic practices of matrilocality and duolocality  i look at matriliny coupled with a strong norm of virilocality in which a woman moved to her husband s house after marriage  this enables an exploration of the implications of this residence norm for women  and particularly its implications for our understanding of the transformation of matrilineal kinship in kerala  paying special attention to the experience of women in tharavad houses and the creation of new houses  coupled with the continuities in the right that a woman retains to residence in her natal house and a right to a share of the property  forces us to question the common sense understanding that matriliny has transformed to patriliny  
  on the perimeter of the lawful   enduring illegality in the irish family planning movement  1972 1985 1 between 1935 and 1985  irish law criminalized the sale and importation of condoms  activists established illegal markets to challenge the law and alleviate its social consequences  they distributed condoms through postal services  shops  stalls  clinics  and machines  though they largely operated in the open  their activities attracted little direct punishment from the state  and they were able to build a stable network of medical and commercial family planning services  we use 30 interviews conducted with former activists to explore this history  in doing so  we also examine the limits of illegality  in describing acts of everyday resistance to law  arguing that the boundaries between legal and illegal  in the discourses and practices of those who sought to challenge the state  were shifting and uncertain  in turn  we revisit illegality   characterizing it as an assemblage of varying selectively performed political practices  shaped by complex choreographies of negotiation between state and non state actors  1 
 22 1 playing on the break   karl polanyi and the double movement   against modern football   while the popularity of english football increases worldwide  there has been a marked rise in the discontent expressed by a small but growing group of domestic fans  this dissent has led to the emergence of a movement broadly defined as being against modern football   amf   a banner under which fans of rival clubs have gathered in an attempt to challenge the poor governance  commercialism and greed that has come to dominate the english game  this article offers a conceptualisation of what it means to be against modern football  based upon karl polanyi s analysis of the market society  developing the dialectic of the double movement  that appears in polanyi s most famous work  the great transformation  this article demonstrates how these governing principles might be useful in explaining both the complex cultural political economy of english football and the possibilities that exist for the amf movement to socially re embed the modern game

 the edifice of forensic examinations will remain       as if it was built on the sand  the issues and the obstacles of the professionnalization process of the forensic medicine in 19th century france en   whereas forensic medicine was becoming a full science during the 19th century  only few physicians were able to build their medical career within this field  forensic examinations were usually practiced by amateurs rather than experts  several factors could explain this situation  judges were legally allowed to call any medical practitioners they wanted  even if these physicians were not properly trained for practicing forensic examinations  before the very beginning of the 20th century there was no specific degree for forensic medicine  moreover  forensic activities were considered as a part of every physician s duties  finally  the fees granted to the required doctors were a major barrier to the professionalization process  
  there s something wrong with you   how young people choose abstinence in a heavy drinking culture 1 contemporary universities in western democracies are renowned for heavy drinking youth cultures  in this context  abstinence is accountable  behaviour that requires justification  some previous research has reported accounts of why young people choose not to drink and the social consequences  but there is limited research on how they achieve abstinence in a heavy drinking culture  drawing on heller s notion of choosing oneself and giddens  concept of reflexive choice making  we show how young non drinking australian university students emphasize abstinence as an individual lifestyle choice  show determined strength in their decision not to drink and report eventual acceptance from their peers  the non drinkers in our research use some similar accounts noted in other research such as being sporty  or focused on their studies   yet they do not position themselves as part of an alternative subculture such as those in straight edge or religious groups  they choose their abstinent selves both in an existential sense and as an act of everyday self identity  we argue that the choice of abstinence needs to be viewed as a part of a positive claim to identity  alongside other alternative ways of being for university students  1 
 26 1 they make me not wanna have a child    effects of companion animals on fertility intentions of the childfree  this article argues that for some who are childfree  the increasing perception of the companion animal as a sentient being with agency provides a deep  meaningful relationship with the power to inform fertility intentions  qualitative  in depth interviews with childfree companion animal owners reveal that this relationship serves to reinforce previous fertility choices such as delaying or completely opting out of childbirth  thus affecting present household structure  this is reflected in the active choice by some participants to have companion animals instead of human children  the presence of a cost benefit analysis concerning animal companions and human children  and narratives that express a desire to mother or nurture as fulfilled in the relationship with the companion animal  implications of these findings for both demography and marriage and family research in the united states are discussed  
  this might be him  the guy i m gonna marry   love and sexual relationships between female elite athletes and male coaches 1 infatuation  love and sexual relationships exist virtually anywhere  coach athlete sexual relationships  casr   however  are overlooked and under researched  within sport sociology  casr have been framed predominantly by a sexual abuse discourse  informed by foucault s discourse analysis  this study explores how discourses regarding performance enhancement in elite sport and coaching  and romantic love  frame female elite athletes  experiences with casr  interviews with four female elite athletes aged 26 30 were conducted  the results indicate that casr are potentially problematic because they intersect and challenge discourses comprising elite sports  coach athlete relationships  female sexual agency  and love  moreover  discourses of power differ between the professional and private contexts  while the athletes expect their coaches to exert dominance and control in the elite sport context  love relationships are about equally and mutually giving away power and control  although casr can facilitate motivation and performance  framing casr as inherently unequal and abusive can contribute to stigmatisation  secrecy and athlete disempowerment  1 
 28 1 transborder conversation  and oppositional codes  mediatised diffusion of social movement discourse between hong kong and china  since 2003  hong kong has gradually transformed into a social movement society   with the help of new technologies  mediatised transborder conversation  about social movement across the border with mainland china  as a verbal practice  has become routine  sojourn students from the mainland  who usually stay in hong kong for several years  actively participate in this verbal practice  taking a discourse centred online ethnography  approach  this study aims to unpack the verbal practice of transborder conversations driven by sojourn students during the umbrella movement from the theoretical perspective of speech codes  by conducting participant observation and in depth interviews with 30 participants  two oppositional codes  cynicism and idealism  have been identified  each code assumes different relations of the self and the state and different political efficacy  which manifests as different interactional practices  the presence of these oppositional codes has endangered the counter hegemonic nature of transborder conversations  
  unassimilable and undesirable   news elites  discursive construction of the american immigrant during the ellis island years 1 this research examines the historical role news elites have played in shaping public perceptions of immigrants as a distinct social group  to that end  we identify the discursive strategies used by the new york times to construct the american immigrant  during the ellis island years  1892 1924   a pivotal period when some of the nation s earliest immigration restriction laws were established  data were collected from front page newspaper articles and analysis was developed using the techniques of critical discourse analysis  drawing on foucault s  1977  theoretical understanding of the enmeshment of power relations in discourse as well as blumer s  1958  group position model  we develop and test five hypotheses about the role of news elites in constructing this social group  finding support for all hypotheses  we show how the article s discursive choices dehumanized immigrants  trivialized their experiences  silenced their voices and helped legitimate an unequal social hierarchy that positions immigrants beneath non immigrants  1 
 30 1 we can write the scripts ourselves    queer challenges to heteronormative courtship practices  courtship conventions are premised on widespread and deeply held cultural beliefs that men and women need and want different things from their romantic relationships  yet queer relationships challenge the notion of distinct gendered behaviors in romantic relationships  and queer people often explicitly seek to undermine conventional relationship practices  using interview data from 40 lgbtq identified respondents  i examine how queer people negotiate culturally dominant gendered dating and courtship practices  my findings show that  rather than replicate heterosexual norms  respondents actively reject them  seeking new and more egalitarian ways of building romantic relationships  significantly  the narratives drawn on to justify egalitarian dating practices are similar to those used in their committed relationships  respondents emphasized egalitarian  flexible  and non gendered care work in committed relationships  indicating that how people date may potentially set the stage for the dynamics in their relationships  the importance placed on these alternative norms in queer communities  however  contradicts respondents  assertions that they can create relationships free from cultural constraints  demonstrating how emerging norms can breed their own pressures for conformity  
  what is up with my sisters  where are you   the origins and consequences of lesbian friendly place reputations for lbq migrants 1 drawing on a comparative ethnography of four small us cities with growing lesbian populations  this article explicates the gap between lesbian  bisexual  and queer female  lbq  individuals  expectations  before moving  and experiences  after relocation   the article asks how prospective lbq migrants encounter knowledge of lesbian friendly reputations  and  once encountered  why they are so powerful  four mechanisms communicate lesbian friendly reputations and make them particularly dominant  with different mechanisms doing this work to different degrees in different cases  first  some of the sites are situated in regions that possess lesbian friendly reputations  prospective migrants attend to regional reputation  missing the heterogeneity of places within a region  second  facts and figures mislead  while lbq migrants conduct background research before relocating  their attention to facts and figures related to lesbian friendliness  such as the proportion of lesbian couples  out politicians  and marriage votes  distracts from knowledge of on the ground lbq ties and identities  third  much initial contact with place is with heterosexuals  many such actors   realtors  business owners  institutional ambassadors   go out of their way to present a place as lesbian friendly to prospective migrants  yet  such individuals are often unaware of or otherwise fail to communicate the particularities of lbq culture in their city  a final force is the belief that a certain set of cities belong in a lesbian friendly category with corresponding expectations of cultural homogeneity  cumulatively  the article highlights the  sometimes obscuring  power of place reputation  underlines gaps between place reputation and identities on the ground  and advances knowledge of the heterogeneity and place specificity of contemporary lbq identities and communities  1 
 32 1 you can t manage with your heart    risk and responsibility in farm to school food safety  farm to school  fts  programs aim to connect school children with local foods  to promote a synergistic relationship between local farmers  child nutrition and education goals  and community development  drawing from 18 months of ethnographic research with a regional fts project and interviews with child nutrition program operators  pos  implementing fts across georgia  we identify perceptions of food safety as an emerging barrier in efforts to bring local foods into schools  conducting a thematic analysis of data related to food safety  we find that fts participation may be hindered by discourses and perceptions of safety risks attributed to local foods and to local produce in particular  we argue that this results  paradoxically  from a core tenant of fts and other local food movements  forging personal relationships with farmers  through which pos confront the transparency of local food production  in contrast to the opacity of food procured through standard supply chains  faced with unfamiliar production practices  and responsibilized to protect students as  at risk  subjects  pos may decide that buying local food is  not worth the risk    
  access without fear    reconceptualizing  access  to schooling for undocumented students in toronto this paper uses chela sandoval s  2000  concept of meta ideologizing to examine how definitions of  access  are reframed to further the goals of social justice activists  meta ideologizing refers to re operationalizing liberal  widely accepted terms to fit the needs of a community  the paper draws from 14 semi structured interviews with individuals pivotal to the passing and implementation of toronto s  students without legal immigration status policy   also known as a  don t ask  don t tell  policy  it also employs data from literature developed by stakeholders as well as the author s experiential knowledge  it examines how organizers have reframed the concept of  access  by extending its focus beyond entry into schools and including the need for undocumented migrants to be safe and have access to other social services  it also analyzes the ways bureaucratic logic can invisibilize the gains made by developing procedures that reify illegalization  
  as parents congregated at parties   responsibility and blame in media representations of violence and school closure in an indigenous community this article considers the discourses of responsibility and blame emerging from newspaper reportage of a crisis in the remote indigenous community of aurukun in northern queensland  australia  in doing so  it aims to contribute to the sociology of racism and add to the existing body of scholarship on the ways in which deracialised media discourse can nevertheless be racist  the month of may 2016 saw violence perpetrated by young people against the teachers and principal of the community s only school  teachers were evacuated to the regional city of cairns on 10 may due to violence in the community and fears for their safety  they returned on 18 may  only to be evacuated again on 25 may  these events form the focus of the reportage analysed in this article  the way in which three primary groups of players   parents  teachers and police   are portrayed in mainstream print media is analysed in order to ascertain how responsibility and blame are apportioned in relation to these events  
  every time they ride  i pray   parents  management of daughters  horseback riding risks this study uses qualitative interviews with 29 parents of horseback riding daughters aged 10 23 years old to explore parents  perceptions of risk and their risk management strategies  as their daughters engage in horse sports and recreation  first  parents are keenly aware of risks in equestrian sports and liken them to risks from automobile accidents and other high risk sports  second  parents manage these risks by working diligently to enhance safety and manage their own emotions  third  they willingly assume these risks as a part of their fundamental commitment to honor their daughters  desires  natural skills  and dreams as equestrian athletes  i situate these findings within the theoretical literature on risky play within a cultural context of condemnation of parents  permissiveness about risk taking  
  i just think something like the  bubs and pubs  class is what men should be having   paternal subjectivities and preparing for first time fatherhood in australia and the united kingdom increasingly in international research and popular media a growing interest in men and fatherhood is discernible  these changes occur as other aspects of the socio economic world shift  necessitating the need to re address how caring and paid work responsibilities are configured and practised  however  interest in men s experiences as fathers has emerged in ways which reflect cultural assumptions and practices associated with dominant understandings of masculinities  consequently  research on and evidence of changing behaviours has been culturally and geographically uneven  in this paper  two qualitative studies are drawn upon to examine how men living in australia and the uk engage in narrate experiences of preparation for first time fatherhood  these studies compare men s in depth accounts of preparing for first time fatherhood in cultures where understandings of masculinities overlap  but where differences are also discernible  the findings illuminate the ways in which biology  gender  temporality and histories of masculinities frame men s preparation activities and service provision  
  i won t take part    exploring the multiple identities of the ethnographer in two ghanaian hospitals this article reflects on how an ethnographer s approach to field entry  the topic of study  her use of ethnographic methods and contextual factors shaped research participants  perception of her multiple identities in a ghanaian hospital environment  her perceived multiple identities influenced trust and distrust relations between her and her research participants  which impacted on the research project  the article discusses the paradox of the researcher s negotiation of her multiple identities of insider  and outsider  and its influence on the process of data collection  understanding and analysis of the study topic  the article argues that research projects give birth to the ethnographer  obviously  the observations of the ethnographer  who is the main research instrument  of her own position  are an important source for data collection  participation and positioning in organizational activities can provide the ethnographer with a personal experience of her study topic and data that enhances understanding of organizational processes  
  mcdonald s music  versus  serious music   how production and consumption practices help to reproduce class inequality in the classical music profession this article draws on two empirical studies on contemporary engagements with classical music in the united kingdom to shed light on the ways in which class inequalities are reproduced in practices of production and consumption  it discusses three ways in which this occurs  first  classical music was naturally  practiced and listened to in middle class homes but this was misrecognised by musicians who labelled families as musical  rather than as middle class   second  the practices of classical music production and consumption such as the spaces used  the dress  and the modes of listening show similarities with middle class culture  third  musicians made judgements of value where classical music was seen as more valuable than other genres  this was particularly visible in studying production  in data on consumption  musicians were careful about making judgements of taste but described urban genres as illegible to them  or assessed them according to the criteria that they used to judge classical music  such as complexity and emotional depth  this hierarchy of value tended to remain unspoken and uncontested  studying production and consumption together allows these patterns to emerge more clearly  
  missing out   reflections on the positioning of ethnographic research within an evaluative framing contemporary approaches to evaluating  complex  social and health interventions are opening up spaces for methodologies attuned to examining contextual complexities  such as ethnography  yet the alignment of the two agendas   evaluative and ethnographic   is not necessarily comfortable in practice  i reflect on experiences of conducting ethnographic research alongside a public health evaluation of a community based initiative in the uk  using the lens of  missing out  to examine intersections between my own ethnographic concerns and those of the communities under study  i examine potential opportunities posed by the discomfort of  missing out   particularly for identifying the processes and spaces of inclusion and exclusion that contributed both to my ethnographic experiences and to the realities of the communities engaging with the initiative  this reveals productive possibilities for a focus on  missing out  as a form of relating for evaluations of the impacts of such initiatives on health and social inequalities  
  our lives is in danger   manus island and the end of asylum the australian funded and operated immigration detention centre on manus island  papua new guinea  serves as a frontline for australia s border policing measures against unauthorised refugees  the willingness of the australian state to forcibly transfer and detain refugees at sites such as manus island reflects its commitment to deterring unauthorised arrivals by punishing them for their methods of travel  comparing the outcomes of the 2016 refugee global summits and recent public inquiries into the conditions on manus island  this article considers the disconnect between australia s criminogenic border policing practices and its supposed commitments to a humanitarian refugee resettlement policy  it argues that the dominant view of resettlement as an outcome to be bestowed on  worthy  refugees removes refugee agency and enables ongoing and systemic human rights abuses at sites such as manus island  for refugees this can only be resolved by establishing a right to free movement  
  there is worse to come   the biopolitics of traumatism in antimicrobial resistance  amr  this paper reflects on the different futures and imaginaries constructed through the politics and policy of antimicrobial resistance  amr   we examine the role of catastrophism  trauma and notions of  resistance  expressed at different moments in the development of the amr debate  the paper focuses on a number of imaginaries in the politics of amr  particularly a characterisation of britain as the  sick man of europe  or the  british disease  and  more recently  the catastrophist prospect of a  return to the dark ages of medicine   we draw upon recent writing in biopolitical philosophy on immunity and autoimmunity  particularly in the work of derrida and sloterdijk  to interrogate immunitary politics of amr at the intersections of the human and the microbial  
  we haven t even buried the dead yet   ethics of discursive contestation in a crisis situation disasters are often described as exceptional moments that demand global solidarity  a state of humanitarian exception  emerges as citizens foreground norms of compassion and cooperation while contestatory discourse   the argumentative  blame seeking and fault finding forms of speech   are stigmatized as inappropriate interventions in a society seeking to recover from a distressful crisis situation  this article critically unpacks these representations of post disaster situations empirically and normatively  by analysing the discussions in the public sphere over the first 100 days after typhoon haiyan battered central philippines  the article examines the moral force behind the discourse of compassion  and its ethical boundary work  that places the discourse of contestation  outside the scope of acceptable conduct  it proposes that the discourse of compassion s ethical boundary work is only democratically acceptable when one takes a short view of a crisis situation  drawing on deliberative democracy theory  the article argues for the importance of contestatory discourse in fostering inclusive discourse formation and ensuring that the state of humanitarian exception does not become the rule  
  in authenticity work  constructing the realm of inauthenticity through thomas kinkade although we know that authenticity work can add value to cultural products  little research explores efforts to claim the inauthenticity of products in commercial markets  the question arises  how does the critical reception of a popular culture phenomenon employ a form of authenticity work to determine the cultural products eligible   or ineligible   for the status of  authentic   this research seeks to answer this question through a comprehensive content analysis of 328 documents from 1998 to 2012 related to the late artist thomas kinkade  we put forth the term inauthenticity work to explain how cultural intermediaries defined cultural products as antithetical to authenticity  even in the face of immense commercial success  intermediaries constructed kinkade s work as exemplifying inauthenticity  defining his work as mass produced  insincere  escapist  and oppositional to high art  such inauthenticity work reveals that even if there is greater variance in cultural products eligible for authentication  intermediaries uphold culture boundaries through critically maintaining a cultural realm of inauthenticity  
  re constructing family images  stepmotherhood before biological motherhood strong cultural values and ideals attached to women in families deem the role of stepmother as inferior to that of biological mother  although biological motherhood is celebrated  stepmotherhood is stigmatized  and women who wish to become mothers but become stepmothers prior to having biological children may grieve the loss of images surrounding normative ideals of creating a family  using a feminist family science approach  the purpose of this grounded theory study was to explore the experiences of women without children in their transition to stepmotherhood  interviews with 23 stepmothers  aged 26 47  revealed that women engaged in an internal process of creating and then adjusting personal images of family life to accommodate their new family circumstances  the process of  re constructing family images had implications for later adjustment to stepmotherhood  notions of the motherhood hierarchy emerged to depict the unique experiences of women who became stepmothers prior to having biological children  
  re constructing the pipeline  workers  environmentalists and ideology in media coverage of the keystone xl pipeline environmental protection is presumed to damper economic growth and media accounts of resource extraction often portray trade offs between jobs and the environment  however  there is limited evidence that environmental protection universally costs jobs and heavily polluting industries provide few jobs in comparison to environmental impacts  therefore  how has media discourse contributed to the taken for granted division between the economy and the environment  this paper uses the keystone xl pipeline controversy as a case of the symbolical conflict between supporters of growth and conservation to explore the role of ideology and power in media discourse  i use frame analysis of newspaper articles to explore the representations of labor and the environment and how hegemonic ideology legitimizes resource extraction  my analysis reveals binary framing that constructed the pipeline as a political controversy over the trade off between the environment and the economy  which made conflict between workers and environmentalists sensible  and silenced alternatives  
 a  movement for improvement   a qualitative study of the adoption of social movement strategies in the implementation of a quality improvement campaign given the difficulties of implementing top down  quality improvements  health service leaders have turned to methods that empower clinicians to co produce bottom up  improvements  this has involved the adoption of strategies and activities associated with social movements  with clinicians encouraged to participate in collective action towards the shared goal of improvement  this paper examines the adoption of social movement methods by hospital managers as a strategy for implementing a quality improvement campaign   our case study suggests that  despite the claim of empowering clinicians to develop bottom up  improvements  the use of social movement methods can be more narrowly concerned with engaging clinicians in pre determined programmes of top down  change  it finds a prominent role for hybrid  clinical leaders and other staff representatives in the mobilisation of the campaign  especially for enrolling clinicians in change activities  the work of these hybrids  suggests some degree of creative mediation between clinical and managerial interests  but more often alignment with the aspirations of management  the study raises questions about the translation of social movement s theories as a strategy for managing change and re inventing professionalism  
 a  different class   homophily and heterophily in the social class networks of britpop social network analysis is increasingly recognised as a useful way to explore music scenes  in this article we examine the individuals who were the cultural workforce that comprised the britpop  music scene of the 1990s  the focus of our analysis is homophily and heterophily to determine whether the clusters of friendships and working relationships of those who were best connected  in the scene were patterned by original social class position  we find that britpop s whole network  is heterophilic but that its sub networks  are more likely to be social class homophilic  the sub networks that remain heterophilic are likely to be united by other common experiences that brought individuals in the network to the same social spaces  we suggest that our findings on britpop might be generalised to the composition of other music scenes  cultural workforces and aggregations of young people  our study differs from research on  first  british indie music  and social class which focuses upon the construction  representation and performance of social location rather than the relationships it might shape and second  the pioneering social network analyses of music scenes which currently lack explicit emphasis on social class  
 a  fair cop   queer histories  affect and police image work in pride march this article investigates how proactive police image work contends with the politics of queer history by drawing from aspects of affect theory  it asks  how does police image work engage with or respond to ongoing histories of state violence and queer resistance  and why does this matter  to explore these questions  the article provides a case study of the victorian pride march in 2002  it analyzes textual representations of chief commissioner christine nixon s participation in the parade to show how histories of homophobic police violence can be used strategically to fortify a positive police image among lgbt people and the wider community  police image work carried out at pride march becomes a means of legitimizing past policing practices with the aim of overcoming poor and antagonistic lgbt police relations  the visibility of police at pride march  this analysis suggests  contributes to the normalization of queerness as a site to be continually policed and regulated  image work here also buttresses police reputation against the negative press associated with incidents of police brutality  this investigation contributes to the literature on police communications and impression management by demonstrating how police can mobilize negative aspects of their organizational history as an important part of police image work in the present  
 a comparative method for themes saturation  comets  in qualitative interviews saturation of data has been acknowledged by many social scientists as evidence of rigor in qualitative research  though there is a consensus about its definition and usefulness in qualitative research  the methods for achieving saturation are scarce while the social scientists who mention data saturation in their research methodologies do not adequately describe how this is achieved  this paper describes a new method for achieving saturation in studies that use interviews  the method is called comparative method for themes saturation  comets   comets is comparative in two ways  first  all themes from all interviews are compared with each other  second  the sequence of interviews is reordered multiple times in order to check saturation again  this is because the sequence of interviews during the check makes saturation vary and  therefore  reordering helps confirming saturation  this paper concludes that comets is a simple  comparative and holistic method for achieving saturation and that it can be used in complicated qualitative studies  
 a cross national analysis of the causes and consequences of economic news objective  work on economic news argues that u s  coverage focuses primarily on changes rather than levels of future economic conditions  it also both affects and reflects public economic sentiment  given that economic perceptions are related to policy preferences and government support  this is of consequence for politics  this article explores the generalizability of these findings  methods  using nearly 100 000 stories over 30 years in the united states  the united kingdom  and canada  we compare media tone  public opinion  and economic conditions  result  analyses demonstrate that media tone and public opinion follow future economic change in all three countries  media and opinion are also related  but the effect mostly runs from the public to the media  not the other way around  conclusion  these results confirm the generalizability of prior findings  and the importance of considering more than a simple unidirectional link between media coverage and public economic sentiment  
 a faith for all  boundaries of religion and ethnicity among sikhs the religious demographics of the united states are changing  shaped by immigration and conversion of americans to non western religious traditions  research on nonwhite immigrant religious traditions has not addressed how communities of white converts challenge the link between religion and ethnicity  i address this gap  drawing on participant observation and 31 in depth interviews with both indian sikhs and members of sikh dharma  a predominantly white sikh community  i find that although respondents in each community draw on the same elements to construct sikh identity  symbols  values  and practices   they diverge in regards to the specific practices they emphasize  members of sikh dharma redefine both sikh practice and the boundaries around sikhism  incorporating new practices and beliefs while also critiquing the interconnection of punjabi culture with sikhism  indian sikhs express concern about the presentation of these new practices as sikh practices  results have implications for the ever changing relationship of religion and ethnicity  
 a genetic basis of economic egalitarianism studies of political attitudes and ideologies have sought to explain their origin  they have been assumed to be a result of political values ingrained during the process of socialization until early adulthood  as well as personal political experience  party affiliation  social strata  etc  as a consequence of these environment dominated explanations  most biology based accounts of political preference have never been considered  however  in the light of evidence accumulated in recent years  the view that political attitudes are detached from any physical properties became unsustainable  in this paper  we investigate the origins of social justice attitudes  with special focus on economic egalitarianism and its potential genetic basis  we use minnesota twin study data from 2008  collected from samples of monozygotic and dizygotic twin pairs  n   573  in order to estimate the additive genetic  shared environmental  and unique environmental components of social justice attitudes  our results show that the large portion of the variance in a four item economic egalitarianism scale can be attributed to genetic factor  at the same time  shared environment  as a socializing factor  has no significant effect  the effect of environment seems to be fully reserved for unique personal experience  our findings further problematize a long standing view that social justice attitudes are dominantly determined by socialization  
 a global perspective on religious participation and suicide although sociological research in the durkheimian tradition has generally accepted that religious involvement protects against suicide  few studies have examined this theoretical proposition outside western industrialized settings  using multilevel models to analyze data from the world health organization mortality database and the world values survey  1981 2007  across 42 countries in seven geographical cultural regions  this study explores whether religious participation is more protective against suicide in some regions than others and  if so  why  results indicate that while religious participation is protective in latin america  eastern europe  northern europe  and english speaking countries  it may aggravate the risk of suicide in east asia  western europe  and southern europe  this regional variation is the result of differences in both the degree of integration regulation of religious communities and suicide underreporting  overall  the findings support the network perspective of durkheim s classical theory and suggest that researchers should be more cautious about suicide underreporting in less industrialized settings  
 a good ol  country time  does queer rural temporality exist  some queer theorists have developed a theory of queer time   while others question the metronormativity of queer studies  however  we do not yet have an account of rural queer temporality  drawing from a wide survey of works on queer time  this article sets out to imagine what such a theory might entail and how it might demand changes of queer theory  considerations of rural queerness have tended to be representative or ethnographic in nature  this article takes a different tack  it lays the groundwork for a ruralizing reorganization of time and queer affect  to do so  it challenges the temporal modes that often underlie the ostensibly neutral preference for cities  it imagines a queer thing indeed  rural modes influencing queer city life  
 a graph database framework for covert network analysis  an application to the islamic state network in europe this paper proposes a new framework  based on graph database theory  for encoding complex data on covert networks  mapping their structure  and conducting a sensitivity analysis  the framework is then applied to reconstruct the terrorist network of the 2015 2016 attacks in paris and brussels  and related plots in europe by the islamic state group  the resulting network was found to be qualitatively different from the ideologically related al qaeda network  having a lower secrecy and a lower mean degree  under different network generating assumptions   c  2016 elsevier b v  all rights reserved  
 a hierarchical model for analysing consumption patterns in italy before and during the great recession the paper aims to explore how the great recession of the twenty first century has impacted on the consumption behaviour of italian households  following a hierarchical approach  the study investigates differences in consumption behaviour at both household and regional levels  using micro data on italian household expenditure for the years 2002  2006  2010 and 2012  multilevel and two step regression models have been estimated  the analysis has been performed for four different consumption categories  food  housing  work related and leisure  the analysis reveals that the economic crisis led to increasing income elasticity for each category of consumption  especially for food  the most essential basic good  the crisis also created more marked regional disparities in the average level of expenditure  
 a keyword approach to finding common ground in community based definitions of human well being ecosystem based management involves the integration of ecosystem services and their human beneficiaries into decision making  this can occur at multiple scales  addressing global issues such as climate change down to local problems such as flood protection and maintaining water quality  at the local scale it can be challenging to achieve a consistent and sustainable outcome across multiple communities  particularly when they differ in resource availability and management priorities  a key requirement for consistent decision support at the community level is to identify common community objectives  as these can form the basis for readily transferable indices of ecosystem benefit and human well being  we used a keyword based approach to look for common terminology in community fundamental objectives as a basis for transferable indices of human well being and then compared those commonalities to community demographics  location  and type  analysis centered on strategic planning documents readily available from coastal communities in the conterminous united states  we examined strategic planning documents based on eight domains of human well being  and found that living standards and safety and security were the most commonly addressed domains  and health and cultural fulfillment were the least  in comparing communities  regional differences were observed in only one well being domain  safety and security  while community type yielded significant differences in five of the eight domains examined  community type differences followed an urban to rural trend with urban communities focusing on education and living standards  and more rural communities focused on social cohesion and leisure time  across all eight domains multivariate analysis suggested communities were distributed along two largely orthogonal gradients  one between living standards and leisure time and or connection to nature  and a second between safety and security and social priorities  education health culture social cohesion   overall these findings demonstrate the use of automated keyword analysis for obtaining information from community strategic planning documents  moreover  the results indicate measures and perceptions of well being at the local scale differ by community type  this information could be used in management of ecosystem services and development of indices of community sustainability that are applicable to multiple communities with similar demographics  regional location  and type  
 a mixed methods evaluation approach for the study of macro micro interactions on the development of teaching  and learning oriented beliefs of mathematics student teachers in the introductory phase of study especially in the case of longitudinal evaluations  mixed methodological approaches appear to be useful  since the studies are basically suitable for evaluating evaluation objects of a high degree of complexity  such as  for example  dynamic processes in educational structures  basing on the longitudinal development of professions related beliefs of mathematics student teachers  this article describes how macro  and microstructures can be taken into account by integrating results obtained through different research methods  with the help of latent growth curve models the development of beliefs of 235 student teachers at five universities could be modeled longitudinally  on the basis of 19 interviews  afterwards interrelationships between institutional frameworks and the individual development of beliefs could be identified on the basis of case studies  amongst others  a high degree of agreement to constructivist oriented forms of teaching and learning could be revealed  which can be partly attributed to the experience of university teaching  
 a model and indicator of aggregate need satisfaction for capped objectives and weighting schemes for situations of scarcity normative criteria for evaluations of economic and social outcomes are often formulated in terms of social welfare functions which are essentially and importantly non satiable  however  there are good reasons to consider certain normative criteria and many policy objectives to be capped  i e  bounded  and thus satiable provided sufficient resources are made available for their satisfaction  inspired by the foster greer thorbecke class of indicators  this paper uses an interdisciplinary approach to develop a model for assessing outcomes in terms of capped objectives based on an understanding of individual shortfalls from the objective  denoted needs  we present an indicator to measure need satisfaction in a population of individuals with heterogeneous needs and highlight an aggregation problem under scarcity  for such situations  we develop three ways in which the indicator can be weighted that reflect respectively concerns over the frequency  depth and severity of the need shortfalls and show that normative evaluations based on these weighting schemes can conflict  yielding mutually inconsistent outcome rankings  the indicator can be adapted to measure a wide variety of phenomena  e g  health needs  education shortfalls  deprivation  etc   and it is suited for targeting exercises and other policy implementations  in particular  it allows for exogenous weighting schemes  i e  weights that can incorporate non shortfall characteristics relevant for the evaluation  e g  age  gender  ethnicity  etc  the indicator thus enables new ways for researchers to promote and study satiable objectives in a wide variety of contexts relevant to economic and social policy  e g  human development programs  poverty reduction  healthcare policies  etc  
 a multidimensional view  evaluating the different and combined contributions of diaries and interviews in an exploration of asexual identities and intimacies this article evaluates the relative contributions of diaries and interviews in multiple methods qualitative research exploring asexual identities and intimacies  differentiated by three core differences  reflective time frame  the day just had lifetime   context  alone with researcher  and mode  written verbal   these methods had the potential to generate a multidimensional view of our topics  using five cases in which data from both interviews and diaries were collected  this article explores how the intermeshed issues of identity and intimacy were constructed in each method  as well as reflecting on what was gained by their combination  our analysis leads us to conclude that multiple methods do not always produce a fuller or a more rounded picture of individual participants  lives  nevertheless  the decision to collect data using different strategies did increase our chances of finding a method that suited individual participants  whether in style or focus  
 a new era of civil rights  latino immigrant farmers and exclusion at the united states department of agriculture in this article we investigate how latino immigrant farmers in the mid atlantic region of the united states navigate united states department of agriculture  usda  programs  which necessitate standardizing farming practices and an acceptance of bureaucracy for participation  we show how latino immigrant farmers  agrarian norms and practices are at odds with the state s requirement for agrarian standardization  this interview based study builds on existing historical analyses of farmers of color in the united states  and the ways in which their farming practices and racialized identities are often unseen by and illegible to the state  this disjuncture leads to the increased racial exclusion of immigrant farmers from usda opportunities  such exclusions impede the transition to a  new era of civil rights   as has been proclaimed by usda leadership  although efforts to address institutionalized racism on a national level may be genuine  they have failed to acknowledge this schism between rural latino immigrants and the state  thereby inhibiting a meaningful transition in the fields  and continuing a legacy of unequal access to agrarian opportunities for non white immigrant farmers  
 a new multidimensional approach to measuring precarious employment this article proposes a new methodology to measure precarious employment with a multidimensional approach  the adjusted multidimensional precariousness rate employed to measure job precariousness is calculated on a counting approach and exhibit several advantages  including its decomposability according to the relative contribution to total precariousness of different dimensions and sub populations  for illustrative purposes  the methodology is applied to the spanish case using microdata from the encuesta de estructura salarial  wage structure survey  and considering three precariousness dimensions of jobs  low wages  fixed term contracts and part time work   the evidence obtained shows that at the beginning of the economic crisis there was an increase in the incidence and intensity of precariousness for new jobs created in the spanish economy  moreover  obtained evidence shows that the incidence of precarious employment is particularly high in certain economic sectors and for females  
 a new paradigm  peter berger s  the two pluralisms  the article discusses peter berger s suggestion to replace the secularization theory by a  new paradigm  of a double plurality  the plurality of religions and the plurality  rather  polarity  of the religious and the secular sphere  whether this constitutes a new paradigm seems just as questionable as whether it is a paradigm at all  after having discussed these two questions the article engages with the basic tenets of berger s concept by asking whether the paradigm is convincing  the discussion focusses on berger s concept of religion  which puts the secular and the religious sphere in opposition to each other   not only in the society but also in the consciousness of the religious subject  
 a non radial dea index for peruvian regional competitiveness in this paper  we propose a method to measure competitiveness performance at the subnational level  with an application to peruvian regions  for this  we propose a benefit of the doubt composite index that summarizes the information of several indicators that characterize competitiveness  it is based on an optimization approach  using data enveloping analysis  dea  techniques  so that each indicator is weighted in an endogenous way  and each unit is evaluated in the most favourable light  our proposed index is a non radial variant of the typical dea scores  which avoids the traditional pitfalls of dea based composite indices  such as unreasonable weights  additionally  we propose a meta frontier approach in order to compare the competitiveness performances across different periods of evaluation  our assessments of the peruvian regions  competitiveness performance improve on the results of traditional dea methods  which award high marks to regions with very heterogeneous performance  i e   regions with very high scores in some indicators  and very poor in others   additionally  the comparison of the performance across time shows a general decrease in the average competitiveness between 2008 and 2014 of the peruvian regions  
 a psychological firewall  risk perceptions and public support for online censorship in russia objective  authoritarian regimes commonly justify internet censorship by framing the internet as a threat to their citizens that must be tightly controlled for their own protection  this threat rhetoric underpins government censorship and creates a  psychological firewall  driving public support for a censored internet  methods  based on risk and decision making scholarship  we evaluate how mass media and partisan regime support promulgate these threat perceptions  and in turn how they influence citizen attitudes about censorship  employing russia as a case study  we tested our hypotheses with a national survey  n   1 600  conducted in may 2014  results  we found that reliance on russian national tv news predicted greater internet threat perceptions  and in turn these threat perceptions significantly increased support for online political censorship  conclusion  approval of the putin government further amplified the impact of these threat perceptions on support for censorship  implications for understanding psychological foundations for support for censorship in authoritarian contexts are discussed  
 a quality of growth index for developing countries  a proposal this paper proposes a new quality of growth index for developing countries  the index encompasses both the intrinsic nature and social dimensions of growth  and is computed for over 90 countries for the period 1990 2011  the approach is premised on the fact that not all growth is created equal in terms of social outcomes  and that it does matter how one reaches from one level of income to another for various theoretical and empirical reasons  the paper finds that the quality of growth has been improving in the vast majority of developing countries over the past two decades  although the rate of convergence is relatively slow  at the same time  there are considerable cross country variations across income levels and regions  finally  empirical investigations point to the fact that main factors of the quality of growth are political stability  public pro poor spending  macroeconomic stability  financial development  institutional quality and external factors such as fdi  
 a quantitative analysis of food movement convergence in four canadian provinces whether the food movement is most likely to transform the food system through  alternative  or  oppositional  initiatives has been the focus of considerable scholarly debate  alternative initiatives are widespread but risk reinforcing the conventional food system by supporting neoliberal discourse and governance mechanisms  including localism  consumer choice  entrepreneurialism and self help  while oppositional initiatives such as political advocacy have the potential for system wide change  the current neoliberal political and ideological context dominant in canada poses difficulties for initiatives that explicitly oppose the conventional food system  as such  some argue that the food movement requires convergence between alternative and oppositional initiatives  in this paper  we investigate convergence using survey results from 143 food movement organizations in four canadian provinces  results based on cluster analysis and descriptive statistics on organizational discourse  activities and visions of sustainable food systems demonstrate convergence around neoliberal discourse and governance mechanisms  localism and consumer education characteristics are particularly prominent  with a majority of respondents describing their organizations as  local   engaging in consumer education activities  and stating the importance of consumer education activities  indicating convergence around alternative  rather than oppositional  initiatives  while convergence around these discourse and strategies may limit the transformative potential of the food system when interpreted as neoliberalisation of the movement  such a reading does not demonstrate their full potential  as survey results also indicate trends of transformative visions of change and political engagement  particularly at the municipal level  this research demonstrates that the movement can work simultaneously within  and opposed to  the conventional food system  and provides understanding of both neoliberal leanings and the politics of the possible of the food movement  
 a rehabilitative justice pathway for war traumatized offenders caught in the military misconduct catch 22 the united states and canada  among others  have recognized that  misconduct stress behaviors  can be a  hidden  by product of war zone deployments  the american military s paradigm of punishment over treatment creates a  military misconduct catch 22   in which the service member s treatment need is identified as a result of  or only after  violations of military law  civilian society then bears the justice  familial  and social costs of the military s failure to address combat stress based misconduct  as an alternative to existing punitive military pathways  we propose a rehabilitative justice pathway that builds on the successes of civilian criminal justice mental health courts to be implemented during active duty service  before separation from the armed forces  the approach  predicated on the circumstances of each case  promotes resilience  honorable discharge  and successful reintegration of service members into society  
 a sensory sociology of the future  affect  hope and inventive methodologies this article examines the difficulty of researching the intangibility of the future  drawing on recent work on visual and sensory sociology  affect  and futurity  i propose that inventive methodologies provide some ways of grasping  understanding  and attuning to the future  to develop this argument  i pay close attention to the children of unquiet  2013 2014  film project by artist mikhail karikis  which involved karikis working with children to probe the possible futures of a site that was once invested with hope and progress  but has since been depopulated  in turning to an art project  my intention is to examine the resonances between the project and some of the concerns of a sensory sociology of the future  in particular  i discuss the participation of children  and a conceptualization of hope as potentiality  open  affective and in the present  in conclusion  i explicate how the article seeks to contribute to a sensory sociology of the future by offering some indicative coordinates for this emerging field of research  including its involvement in creating conditions through which possible futures might be invented  
 a social ecology of civil conflict  shifting allegiances in the conflict in sierra leone drawing on data from a survey of 1043 ex combatants who took part in the civil war in sierra leone  1991 2002  this paper explores the conditions that predict a key outcome in the conflict literature  defection  or side switching between the various organizations at war  this paper advances arguments drawn from the organizational ecology school and works to extend key theories related to  blau space  to the study of civil war  using a series of logistic regression procedures  this paper tests various competing hypotheses against key contributions of the organizational ecology school  key findings of this work suggest support for major hypotheses in this literature as net of important theoretical conditions  defections are most likely when individuals are either demographically atypical of their organization  niche edge  or most susceptible to competition for their services by other groups  niche overlap    c  2017 elsevier inc  all rights reserved  
 a sociology of legal distinctions  introducing contemporary interpretations of classic socio legal concepts in this introduction to main currents in contemporary sociology of law  i briefly comment on the current state of socio legal studies and sociology of law and reasons leading to this collection of essays  i subsequently focus on some general problems which constantly recur in different socio legal contexts  especially on the sociological critique of legal formalism and the closely related distinctions between internal and external perspectives of law and legal facts and values  discussing these classic distinctions  i argue that they are an intrinsic part of both legal and sociological interpretations of positive law  sociology of law  therefore  cannot resolve theoretical and methodological dilemmas associated with them  yet it can rethink and reformulate them to better understand its own position as a social science of positive law in contemporary society  
 a transmaterial approach to walking methodologies  embodiment  affect  and a sonic art performance bodily methodologies that engage with the affective  rhythmic  and temporal dimensions of movement have altered the landscape of social science and humanities research  walking is one such methodology by which scholars have examined vital  sensory  material  and ephemeral intensities beyond the logics of representation  extending this rich field  this article invokes the concept trans to reconceptualize walking research through theories that attend to the vitality and agency of matter  the interconnectedness between humans and non humans  the importance of mediation and bodily affect  and the necessity of acknowledging ethico political responsibility  while theoretical and empirical research about embodied  emplaced  and sensorial relations between moving bodies and space are well developed in the field of walking studies  their entanglements become profoundly altered by theories of trans   transcorporeality  transspecies  and transmaterialities  taking up trans theories we experiment in thinking with a sonic art performance  walking to the laundromat  which probes bodily  affective  and gendered labour  
 a two dimensional two layered societal index of interpersonal destructiveness  internal consistency analysis although the world health assembly emphasized as early as in 1996 the need for violence prevention  there is still no generally accepted index for interpersonal destructiveness in a society  hereby we propose a societal index of interpersonal destructiveness  siid  that could be used to compare interpersonal violence in different societies  siid is a composite of two sub indices   1  index of interpersonal destructiveness prerequisites  and  2  index of interpersonal destructiveness consequences  this study addresses the construction and internal consistency analysis of siid  the indices for periods 1989 1993  1994 1999  1999 2004  2005 2007 and 2008 2010 are computed and for 28 48 countries  depending on availability of high quality and comparative data across time  we conclude that siid has considerable potential as an internally consistent yardstick for evaluating and comparing the level of interpersonal destructiveness of societies worldwide  
 a two way process  a qualitative and quantitative investigation of majority members  acculturation acculturation refers to changes that result from intercultural contact  although it is commonly defined as a two way process with changes occurring among both minority members and majority members  surprisingly little research has focused on the acculturation of majority members  using a combination of qualitative and quantitative data  the present study attempted to fill this gap by exploring how and how much majority members change because of exposure to immigrant cultures  in the first part  using an open response format  majority members reported positive as well as negative cultural change across a broad range of life domains  most changes were reported in the private as compared to public sphere  and in terms of behaviours rather than values  second  based on their responses to quantitative acculturation scales  the majority group participants could meaningfully be clustered into three acculturation strategies commonly used to describe minority group members  acculturation  namely a separation  integration and undifferentiated acculturation cluster  no evidence for an assimilation cluster was found  separated majority members  i e   who maintain their majority culture but do not adopt immigrant cultures  reported significantly more identity threat and perceived ethnic discrimination  but also higher self esteem  interestingly  integrated majority members  i e   who both maintain their majority culture and adopt immigrant cultures  were three times less likely to live in multi ethnic neighbourhoods as compared to separated participants  the results of this study offer important insights into majority members  acculturation experiences and their psychological importance  implications for culturally plural societies and future research are discussed  
 a typology of political participation online  how citizens used twitter to mobilize during the 2015 british general elections this study investigates how  and to what extent  citizens use twitter as a platform for political mobilization in an electoral context  conceptualizing political participation as a process  we develop a typology of political participation designed to isolate mobilizing calls for action from the rest of the political discussion online  based on twitter data collected one week prior to the 2015 british general election  we then identify the top 100 most retweeted accounts using the hashtag  ge2015  classify them by actor type  and perform a content analysis of their twitter posts according to our typology  our results show that citizens   not political parties   are the primary initiators and sharers of political calls for action leading up to the election  however  this finding is largely due to an uneven distribution of citizen driven mobilizing activity  a small number of highly active users  typically supporters of nationalist parties  are by far the most active users in our dataset  we also identify four primary strategies used by citizens to enact mobilization through twitter  in text calls for action  hashtag commands  sharing mobilizing content  and frequent postings  citizens predominantly expressed political calls for action through twitter s hashtag feature  a finding that supports the notion that traditional conceptions of political participation require nuance to accommodate the new ways citizens are participating in the politics of the digital age  
 a worldwide measure of societal quality of life this paper proposes a comprehensive new measure of societal quality of life  qol  at the national level  focusing on livability  the environmental  external factors that constitute a society s qol this measure derives from a novel and multifaceted analysis of subjective wellbeing data  in determining what people actually value  the measure allows for a comprehensive cross country comparison of qol that complements normative objective list or capabilities approaches  the analysis supports the five broad categories of community and relationships  freedom and opportunity  health and environment  living standard  and peace and security as antecedents to qol  current measures overlook or deemphasize aspects of these elements  this paper explains the methodology used to construct the index and  provides complete country rankings of qol for 143 countries since 2000  
 abolitionist futures and the us sanctuary movement this article focuses on the histories  current challenges  and future directions of the sanctuary movement in the united states  which is becoming a central front of resistance to the administration of donald trump  the article is comprised of three main components  it discusses the history of the us sanctuary movement and situates it in the context of the rise of neoliberalism and its attendant escalating criminalisation  particularly since the 1980s  when the first iteration of the movement began  the article then discusses the limits of sanctuary  rooted in the movement s liberal framework that risks reproducing the exclusions it has sought to dismantle  it nevertheless argues for the importance of sanctuary in opposing the trump regime  while advocating that the movement adopt a more radical framework and solidarity organising strategies inspired by the prison abolition movement  
 abuelos at home  differential impact on children s education by family structure improvements in life expectancy have increased interactions between grandchildren and grandparents  this paper examines how grandparent s co residence shapes grandchildren s educational progression by grandchildren s family structure  based on a life course perspective approach  i use three waves of novel panel data from the mexican family life survey  and ask whether grandparent s co residence influence grandchildren s educational transitions  depending upon grandchildren s family structure  and whether grandparents  education influence grandchildren s educational transitions  this study suggests that grandparents  co residence does not have a linear effect on the process of educational attainment  given that its effect maybe positive  negative  of null depending on family structure and the specific roles grandparents assume  it also shows that in countries like mexico  where the education of older cohorts is fairly low  grandparent s education is not associated with grandchildren s school progression  
 aca fans and fan communities  an operative framework fan communities represent a major interest for researchers of consumer culture  however  their study has confronted scholars with a fundamental problem  how can one reconcile critical distance with being sufficiently integrated within a given fan community to gather reliable information  the phrase aca fan  has become a familiar designation for scholars who are also fans  however  while the theoretical implications of the aca fan s posture have been widely discussed  conceptual  practical and methodological modalities remain to be unified  shifting the focus away from strictly theoretical debates  we propose an operative framework for the role of the aca fan  we consider the position of aca fans as a node between academic and fan communities  familiar with both languages and therefore facilitating the process of integration of knowledge and take into account the relations that the aca fans can have with the field  models and materials they collect  as well as the hierarchy between academic and fan sources of knowledge  providing practical suggestions to acknowledge various degrees of authority of fan voices  finally  since aca fans have an important control of  and responsibility for  the fields  models and data they study and the discourses they cite  the implications of aca fans  works for the perception of fan communities by society will be analysed  this article supports the fact that a rationalised position of aca fans could not only be an optimal method to study communities of fan but also an intrinsically ethical way to approach these large communities of consumers  
 access  agenda building and information subsidies  media relations in professional sport while much research has examined the composition of sport media and those charged with constructing it  namely sport journalists and editors  far less has explored an essential set of actors in the construction of news  sources  this study aimed to explore the construction of the sport media agenda from arguably the most important sport news sources  sport media relations managers  in particular  this paper asked  how do media staff in sports organisations influence the production of news  to answer this question  this paper is based on a qualitative  observational study of a professional australian rules football club in australia  involving interviews  observations and document analysis  research within a professional australian rules football club found that the club delivered high quality information subsidies that met sports journalists  newswork requirements  however  media access was almost solely limited to these information subsidies  which are highly subjective and negotiated  which in turn allowed the professional football club to significantly control the subsequent media agenda  
 achieving a global mind set at home  student engagement with immigrant children developing a global mind set in college students is a goal of many colleges and universities  most often this goal is met by encouraging students to study abroad  this article explains how a service learning student engagement program at home achieves this goal by pairing introduction to sociology students with young immigrant children in a weekly formal mentoring relationship  research on the program shows that students develop new perspectives about immigrant issues and that students report a reduction of their level of prejudice against immigrants coming from around the globe  quantitative outcomes assessed on a likert prejudice scale support service learning participants  reports of lower prejudice levels than those in a control group  this teaching method has significant implications for providing opportunities to students from all socioeconomic backgrounds to engage in service learning  achieving global mind sets at home  
 adapting agricultural water use to climate change in a post soviet context  challenges and opportunities in southeast kazakhstan the convergence of climate change and post soviet socio economic and institutional transformations has been underexplored so far  as have the consequences of such convergence on crop agriculture in central asia  this paper provides a place based analysis of constraints and opportunities for adaptation to climate change  with a specific focus on water use  in two districts in southeast kazakhstan  data were collected by 2 multi stakeholder participatory workshops  21 semi structured in depth interviews  and secondary statistical data  the present day agricultural system is characterised by enduring soviet era management structures  but without state inputs that previously sustained agricultural productivity  low margins of profitability on many privatised farms mean that attempts to implement integrated water management have produced water users associations unable to maintain and upgrade a deteriorating irrigation infrastructure  although actors engage in tactical adaptation measures  necessary structural adaptation of the irrigation system remains difficult without significant public or private investments  market based water management models have been translated ambiguously to this region  which fails to encourage efficient water use and hinders adaptation to water stress  in addition  a mutual interdependence of informal networks and formal institutions characterises both state governance and everyday life in kazakhstan  such interdependence simultaneously facilitates operational and tactical adaptation  but hinders structural adaptation  as informal networks exist as a parallel system that achieves substantive outcomes while perpetuating the inertia and incapacity of the state bureaucracy  this article has relevance for critical understanding of integrated water management in practice and adaptation to climate change in post soviet institutional settings more broadly  
 add female veterans and stir  a feminist perspective on gendering veterans research this article examines how scholarship on veterans has begun to incorporate gender as a relevant category of research  drawing on feminist theory  it identifies different approaches to gender within the field of veterans studies and suggests avenues for advancing this aspect of research  the vast majority of gender research on veterans treats gender as a descriptive category or variable through a focus on female veterans or gender differences  this article argues that research on veterans can be enriched by employing gender as an analytical category  focusing on gender norms  power and inequality based on gender  and the intersections of gender with other categories of social difference opens up new questions for gender research on veterans  this kind of broader  analytical conceptualization of gender reveals the ways in which gender shapes the transition to civilian life for all veterans and how veterans policies and programs impact gender relations  
 addicted to hate  identity residual among former white supremacists the process of leaving deeply meaningful and embodied identities can be experienced as a struggle against addiction  with continuing cognitive  emotional  and physiological responses that are involuntary  unwanted  and triggered by environmental factors  using data derived from a unique set of in depth life history interviews with 89 former u s  white supremacists  as well as theories derived from recent advances in cognitive sociology  we examine how a rejected identity can persist despite a desire to change  disengagement from white supremacy is characterized by substantial lingering effects that subjects describe as addiction  we conclude with a discussion of the implications of identity residual for understanding how people leave and for theories of the self  
 adolescents  sociopolitical values in the context of organized activity involvement sociopolitical values are hypothesized to form during adolescence  but the developmental and contextual origins of these values have been largely unexplored  a sample of 846 adolescents  m age   15 96  sd   1 22  range   13 20 years  reported on their organized activity involvement  volunteering  sports  church  community clubs  arts music  school clubs  and their sociopolitical values  patriotism  authoritarianism  spirituality  social dominance  materialism   structural equation models  controlling for demographics and accounting for shared variance among variables  indicated that there were unique associations between activities and values  greater church and sports involvement was related to higher levels of spirituality  involvement in sports was also related to higher levels of materialism and authoritarianism  greater volunteer involvement was related to lower social dominance  and involvement in arts music was associated with less patriotism  these findings suggest that organized activity involvement may provide a context for adolescents  developing sociopolitical values  implications and future directions are discussed  
 adopting neuroscience  parenting and affective indeterminacy what happens when neuroscientific knowledges move from laboratories and clinics into therapeutic settings concerned with the care of children  brain based parenting  is a set of discourses and practices emerging at the confluence of attachment theory  neuroscience  psychotherapy and social work  the neuroscientific knowledges involved understand affective states such as fear  anger and intimacy as dynamic patterns of coordination between brain localities  as well as flows of biochemical signals via hormones such as cortisol  drawing on our own attempts to adopt brain based parenting  and engaging with various strands and critiques of new materialism and affect theory  we explore the ways in which the social sciences and humanities might fruitfully engage with neuroscientific concepts and affects  how does science affected indeterminacy  with all its promises of ontological and experiential agency  help us to observe  wait  bind or hold together volatile mixtures of habit  speech and action  
 adult men and the post industrial  turn   breadwinning gender norms  masculine occupational tasks and midlife school trajectories post 1970s restructuring exacerbated occupational skill and occupational sex segregation divides by reducing jobs in male dominated occupations requiring less than college  economic precarity might have motivated men to extend postsecondary careers into adulthood due to economic interests  however  men s gender socialization as  breadwinners  and familiarity with performance of stereotypically masculine occupational tasks might have discouraged postsecondary attainment in adulthood  using national survey of families and households data  1987 2003   event history and multinomial methods  we find that adult men s postsecondary entry and completion of baccalaureate and higher degrees was strongly motivated by economic factors  including market precarity  however  traditional gender role attitudes and exposure to masculine task performance  as counter vailing forces  significantly constrained men s potential educational gains  we briefly address policies that might reduce adult men s barriers to attainment  
 adult mortality five years after a natural disaster exposure to extreme events has been hypothesized to affect subsequent mortality because of mortality selection and scarring effects of the event itself  we examine survival at and in the five years after the 2004 indian ocean earthquake and tsunami for a population representative sample of residents of aceh  indonesia who were differentially exposed to the disaster  for this population  the dynamics of selection and scarring are a complex function of the degree of tsunami impact in the community  the nature of individual exposures  age at exposure  and gender  among individuals from tsunami affected communities we find evidence for positive mortality selection among older individuals  with stronger effects for males than for females  and that this selection dominates any scarring impact of stressful exposures that elevate mortality  among individuals from other communities  where mortality selection does not play a role  there is evidence of scarring with property loss associated with elevated mortality risks in the five years after the disaster among adults age 50 or older at the time of the disaster  
 advantaged disadvantaged school neighborhoods  parental networks  and parental involvement at elementary school this article examines the relationship between parental networks and parental school involvement during the elementary school years  using a large  nationally representative data set of elementary school studentsthe early childhood longitudinal study kindergarten cohortand contextual data from the 2000 u s  census  our multilevel analysis shows that higher levels of parental networks in first grade are associated with higher levels of parental school involvement in third grade after controlling for individual  and school level characteristics  parental networks are positively related to school involvement activities in formal organizations that consist of parents  teachers  and school staff  including participating in parent teacher organizations and volunteering at school  furthermore  the positive effects of parental networks on parental school involvement is stronger for families whose children attend schools in disadvantaged neighborhoods  this suggests that well connected parental networks can serve as a buffer against school neighborhood disadvantages in encouraging parents to be actively involved in schools  
 affect and taste  bourdieu  traditional music  and the performance of possibilities in his famous distinction  bourdieu set forth musical and artistic taste as reflections of class positions developed early in life  with classical music as an explanatory tool  bourdieu argued that cultural capital becomes deeply embodied and difficult to change  in temperance of bourdieu s use of class  we suggest an affective theory of taste through the case of traditional music  based on a performance of possibilities inspired by our experiences in two pubs  one english and one irish  commonly played in pubs  traditional music can draw on rural lore to share its message with singing patrons of mixed class backgrounds  we use traditional music to argue that place shapes diverse social ties at all levels of economics  education  and age  we do not dispute that class powerfully shapes taste  but through what we term the joy of transcendence   formed through distinct and relative experiences  bonds  and friendships  enacted through place   participants can find pleasure in opening the cages of class and connecting across difference  
 afhvs 2017 presidential address the purpose driven university  the role of university research in the era of science commercialization as efforts to commercialize university research outputs continue  critics charge that universities and university scientists are failing to live up to their public interest purpose  in this paper  i discuss the distinctions between public interest and private interest research institutions and how commercialization of university science may be undermining the public interest  i then use jurgen habermas s concept of communicative action as the foundation for efforts to establish public spaces for ethical deliberation among scientists and university administrators  such ethical deliberation is necessary to facilitate discussion on whether public interest science should be the research university s primary purpose and what institutional rules and resources are needed to honor that purpose  
 age homogamy  gender  and earnings  sweden 1990 2009 previous research has shown considerable marriage premiums in earnings for men  but often penalties for women of being in a union  in this study we extend this research by analyzing how the age difference between spouses affects the earnings profiles by gender  as we follow people over time in advance as well as within their marriage  we can separate premarital from postmarital earnings movements  the data consist of information on annual earnings 1990 2009 for all swedes born 1960 1974  n   926 219   the results indicate that age homogamy is related to higher earnings for both men and women  and that larger age differences are generally associated with lower union premiums  quite independently of which spouse is older  however  most of these results are explained by assortative mating  in which men and women with greater earnings potentials find partners of a similar age  overall  the age difference between spouses seems to have a limited causal effect  if any  on individual earnings  
 ageing and memory medication  social rationales and consumption practices this article focuses on the social rationales underlying the consumption or rejection of medication for memory by the elderly  our analysis is set within the wider frame of the current use of psychopharmaceuticals for the enhancement of everyday performance  discussing its relationship to new cultures of ageing  our results  from a recently concluded study  point to different patterns of investment in memory in old age  on the one hand  we found a willingness to consume medication for memory   a heterogeneous disposition split between the imaginary of disease and that of performance enhancement  on the other hand  we found a cultural resistance and scepticism towards the use of psychopharmaceuticals for performance purposes  this suggests that a new frame of psychopharmaceuticalization of old age   represented by memory medication   is prompting different rationales  ranging from consumption to resistance  
 aging heroes  growing old in popular culture using nationally representative data on nonresident fathers  this study examines father child contact and child support payments in lithuania  we focus on previously married and cohabiting fathers whose parenting rights and obligations are organized differently by lithuanian legislation  our findings demonstrate that previously cohabiting fathers  involvement in child rearing is more significantly associated with levels of individual income resources rather than family formation type  we argue that legal uncertainties linked to nonmarital fatherhood reinforce the inequalities of men s paternal rights and place previously cohabiting fathers  particularly with low socioeconomic resources  in disadvantaged positions  moreover  we argue based on international evidence that universal social policies to support fathers  social citizenship rights before separation and across household or family types  including greater individualization of lithuania s generous parental leave provisions  would encourage father child contact for low socioeconomic fathers following cohabitation dissolution and reduce traditional male breadwinning barriers to father child contact  
 agro digital governance and life itself  food politics at the intersection of code and affect this article seeks to answer the following questions  how are digital platforms encountered and felt by producers and consumers and how do these assemblages shape the foodscapes we imagine and enact  how do elements like digital locks  proprietary code  and open  code inform how we think about the subject of agrofood governance  finally  what are the lives being made to live  and left to let die  as a result of digital platforms  from those employing digital locks and proprietary software to those built on open source code  to do this  the paper draws upon two case studies  the first examines london area producers and consumers linked to the web based distribution platform farmdrop  this is followed by a case study involving us producers loosely linked to the group farm hack  a group that promotes technology that is collectively built and freely shared  and which desires to hack  that which is not  to conclude  the article turns briefly to berry s  2001  thoughts on interactivity  while insightful  as the concept helps us think about the less than overt ways in which code based assemblages enable and disable  the aforementioned case studies allow for some refinements to what it means to do and be interactive  
 alfred kazin and the holocaust the reputation of alfred kazin is based primarily on his criticism of american literature  but his intense jewish consciousness was self evident  and that identity was haunted by the horror and memory of the holocaust  it challenged his faith in the power of language to grasp the texture of experience  the holocaust also shattered his friendship with elie wiesel  whose memoir of auschwitz and buchenwald led kazin the question the veracity of the nobel laureate  
 all the puertorriquenidad that s fit to print  unamerican racial citizens in the new york times  1948 1958  while scholars have shown how  color blind racism  functions as the dominant form of racist discourse in the post civil rights era  few have interrogated how this logic operated before the advent of us civil rights  or how ethno racial groups such as puerto ricans exist in an unique and liminal position and have been subject to color blind racist discourse  the authors explore the construction of puerto rican identity during the pre civil rights  a time rife with color blind american paternalism over the supposed cultural dysfunctions of the puerto rican diaspora  an era of mass puerto rican emigration to the us  and a moment when puerto rico underwent a political change  the authors employ a content analysis of the new york times  1948 to 1958  in order to investigate the relationship between the discursive construction of puerto rican identity and the flagship newspaper s use of nationalist and racialized cultural schemata  
 alternative muslim modernities  bosnian intellectuals in the ottoman and habsburg empires the habsburg takeover of ottoman bosnia herzegovina  1878 1918  is conventionally considered the entry of this province into the european realm and the onset of its modernization  treating the transition from one empire to another not as a radical break  but as in many respects continuity  reveals that the imperial context provided for the existence of overlapping affiliations that shaped the means by which modernity was mediated and embodied in the local experience  drawing on bosnian and ottoman sources  this article analyzes bosnian intellectuals  conceptions of their particular muslim modernity in a european context  it comparatively evaluates the ways in which they integrated the modernist discourse that developed in the ottoman empire and the broader muslim world  and how they also contributed to that discourse  i show that their concern with modernity was not abstract but rather focused on concrete solutions that the muslim modernists developed to challenges in transforming their societies  i argue that we must incorporate islamic intellectual history  and cross regional exchanges within it  to understand southeastern europe s past and present  and that studies of europe and the middle east need to look beyond geohistorical and disciplinary divisions  
 altruism  new perspectives of research on a classical theme in sociology of morality since coined by comte  altruism has become one of the most controversial concepts in social and behavioral sciences  although altruistic behavior and related topics have been successfully studied within a number of fields  oddly  while the theme of altruism was of primary significance in classical sociology of morality  modern sociology seems to have relatively little interest in studying altruism and altruistic behavior  although there are some exceptions  and the field is largely dominated by other social and behavioral sciences  the article aims at reconsidering altruism as a concept and as an area of research in sociology of morality by reviewing the major concepts of altruism in classical sociology and modern behavioral sciences  the article argues that  although for the new  sociology of morality it is necessary to take into account behavioral and psychological perspectives  a promising sociological approach to the study of altruism in different social contexts can be based on renewing the classical focus on the normative components of moral behavior  
 ambivalence and living apart together in later life  a critical research proposal most unattached older persons who would like an intimate partnership do not want to remarry or be in a marriage like relationship  a growing trend is to live apart together  lat  in an ongoing intimate relationship that does not include a common home  we address the debate about whether lat constitutes a new form of intimate relationship in a critical assessment of research on lat relationships that applies ambivalence and concepts from the life course perspective  we conclude that among older but not younger adults  lat relationships are generally a stable alternative to living with a partner  negotiated in the context of current social institutions and arrangements  we propose research questions that address later life living apart together as an innovative alternative intimate relationship  we encourage comparative work on the unique challenges of later life living apart together  their implications for other family ties  and their connection to social and cultural arrangements  
 american hybrid  donald trump and the strange merger of populism and plutocracy any effort to situate trump s ascendance in the broader currents of cross national developments  or in the longer course of american political development  must begin by recognizing it as a curious hybrid of populism and plutocracy  although american right wing populism has real social roots  it has long been nurtured by powerful elites seeking to undercut support for modern structures of economic regulation and the welfare state  american political institutions offered a distinctive opportunity for a populist figure to draw on this fury to first capture the nomination of the gop  and from that position to ascend to the white house  yet the administration s substantive agenda constitutes a full throated endorsement of the gop economic elite s long standing demands for cuts in social spending  tax reductions for the wealthy  and the gutting of consumer  worker and environmental protections  the chasm between trump s rhetoric and his actions justifies a more skeptical assessment of the breadth and depth of american populism  one that acknowledges how its contours are shaped by the nation s unusual political institutions  its intensifying political polarization and the out sized influence of the wealthy  
 american power  the challenge within the main threat to continued american leadership abroad is social problems at home  these include poverty and the decline of the working class  both of them caused initially by falling levels of work and marriage  policymakers have traditionally tried to counter these trends by changing social benefits and incentives  but the problems are really cultural  reflecting a decline in individualism  the best answer is more structured schools and social programs that promote the disciplines essential to a free society  especially working  immigration should also be reduced and more money spent on education  to promote assimilation  despite donald trump s election  consensus has built supporting such measures  
 an assessment of vulnerability to poverty in punjab  pakistan  subjective choices of poverty indicators this paper investigates whether estimating vulnerability to poverty using consumption expenditures and food calorie intake provide consistent policy implications based on the vulnerability as expected poverty framework  feasible generalized least square  3fgls  method is applied on large data set of about 90 000 households in the punjab province  pakistan  the results indicate that the analysis based on the two approaches results in considerable geographic differences in the distribution of vulnerability to poverty  the implication of our results is that anti vulnerability interventions based on monetary indicators of poverty will penalize those regions with low monetary poverty but high nutrition poverty  
 an essay on the intrinsic relationship between social facts and moral questions value neutrality and science are often equated  this paper argues that the work of doing science and engaging in scientific practices with meaningful objects depend on social facts which have moral prerequisites and are not value neutral  
 an examined life  research into university legal education in the united kingdom and the journal of law and society for academics  the nature of their work means that the socratic demand to live an examined life has a particular force  in this article we look at the extent to which those working in university law schools in england and wales have lived up to this suggestion  in the context of assessing the nature and quality of work on university legal education from the beginnings of university law schools  in doing so  we respond to the comments on such work in the ref 2014 law sub panel report and make some suggestions about likely future developments in the field  
 an occupational portrait of emotional labor requirements and their health consequences for workers scholarship has revealed inconsistent evidence on the issue of whether emotional labor represents an occupational health risk  drawing from emotion regulation theory  the conservation of resources model and the interactive service work literature  we examine the association between occupational emotional labor requirements and worker well being  analyses of a national sample of american workers merged with occupational information from the o net database reveal no evidence that these requirements are associated with psychological distress or high blood pressure  in contrast  emotional labor requirements are associated with a reduced likelihood of self rated poor health  consistent with the conservation of resources model  however  we find health penalties for individuals with emotional labor requirements in resource deprived work contexts  our findings suggest that for individuals with limited job autonomy and little access to civil interpersonal relationships with coworkers  emotional labor requirements may impede successful emotion regulation in ways that contribute to negative occupational outcomes and strain  
 analysis of official suicide statistics in spain  1910 2011  in this article we examine the evolution of suicide rates in spain from 1910 to 2011  as something new  we use standardised suicide rates  making them perfectly comparable geographically and in time  as they no longer reflect population structure  using historical data from a series of socioeconomic variables for all spain s provinces and applying new techniques for the statistical analysis of panel data  we are able to confirm many of the hypotheses established by durkheim at the end of the 19th century  especially those related to fertility and marriage rates  age  sex and the aging index  our findings  however  contradict durkheim s approach regarding the impact of urbanisation processes and poverty on suicide  
 analytical sociology and agent based modeling  is generative sufficiency sufficient  building mechanisms based  black box free explanations is the main goal of analytical sociology  in this article  i offer some reasons to question whether some of the conceptual and methodological developments of the analytical community really serve this goal  specifically  i argue that grounding our computer modeling practices in the current definition of mechanisms posits a serious risk of defining an ideal typical research path that neglects the role that the understanding of the generative process must have for a black box free explanation to be met  i propose some conceptual and methodological alternatives  and i identify some collective challenges that the analytical community should tackle in order not to deviate from its main goal  
 antecedents and consequences of leadership styles  findings from empirical research in multinational headquarters there are numerous studies on the success of various leadership styles that refer to the link between styles and levels of performance and other relevant organizational parameters  data from a recent survey in a multinational headquarters  hqs  replicate previous findings on leadership style concerning the preferences of the subordinates for more participation in decision making  although multinational hqs are in many ways unique organizations that could present unique leadership challenges  too  the findings using traditional models of leadership show how similarly  compared to civilian companies and public administrations  leadership styles are perceived and evaluated by subordinates  apart from that  the survey data indicate that leadership style quite different from what was expected has no significant effect on organizational commitment and mission clarity  the reasons for that result are discussed against the backdrop of the peculiarities of the organization under investigation  
 anthropocene bodies  geological time and the crisis of natality in its explicit engagement with the possibility of human extinction  the anthropocene thesis might be seen as signalling a crisis of natality   engaging with two works of fiction   cormac mccarthy s the road and anne michaels  fugitive pieces   the article explores the embodied  affective and intimate dimensions of the struggle to sustain life under catastrophic conditions  though centred on male protagonists  both novels offer insights into a stratigraphic time  associated primarily with maternal responsibility   involving a temporal give and take that passes between generations and across thresholds in the earth itself  if this is a construction of inter corporeality in which each life and every breath has utmost value  it is also a vision that exceeds the biopolitical prioritization of the organismic body   as evidenced in both mccarthy s and michaels  gesturing beyond the bounds of the living to a forceful  sensate and enigmatic cosmos  
 anti roma attitudes as expressions of dominant social norms in eastern europe although one of the most severe forms of bias all over europe  anti roma prejudice has been neglected within social psychology  we argue that anti roma attitudes need to be recognized as a unique form of prejudice because  a   they reflect socially approved dominant societal norms   b  intergroup contact increases rather than decreases prejudice  and  c  not just negative stereotyping  but also cultural distancing of roma people is a form of social exclusion  we developed an integrative attitudes toward roma scale  atrs  based on existing measures and theoretical assumptions about prejudice toward roma people  we conducted a study  n   1082  relying on student and community samples in hungary and slovakia  exploratory factor analysis revealed and confirmatory factor analysis supported the structural equivalence of a three factor solution of the 16 item scale  consisting of blatant stereotyping  undeserved benefits  and cultural difference  our findings confirmed that intergroup contact with roma people is associated with more negative attitudes  and prejudice is mostly expressed in blatantly negative ways  made possible by social contexts that approve of these beliefs  the analysis also revealed that essentialist  romanticized ideas of cultural differences between roma and non roma populations contribute to the psychological distancing of roma people from the national ingroup  
 applying to college  do information deficits lower the likelihood of college eligible students from less privileged families to pursue their college intentions  evidence from a field experiment information deficits are considered an important source of why students from less privileged families do not enroll in college  even when they are college eligible and intend to go to college  in this paper  we examine whether correct and detailed information on the costs of and returns to higher education increases the likelihood of college applications of less privileged high school graduates who expressed college intentions in their junior high school year  we employ an experimental design with a randomly assigned 25 minute information treatment about funding opportunities for  and returns to  higher education given at berlin schools awarding university entrance qualifications  our analyses show that our information treatment indeed substantially increases the likelihood of treated less privileged students to apply to college  our study indicates that our low cost provision of financial information not only increased their college knowledge but also substantially changed their college application behavior  despite other existing barriers  like economic constraints   c  2017 elsevier inc  all rights reserved  
 are all jobs created equal  a cross national analysis of women s employment and child malnutrition in developing countries using multi level models  the analysis examines female employment and child stunting across 49 developing countries  at the country level  female labor force participation is not associated with malnutrition after controlling for economic development  at the individual level  a binary measure of employment is not significantly associated with malnutrition  however  a more nuanced measure of seven occupational categories shows that certain types of employment improve malnutrition  professional  clerical  sales  and domestic jobs are associated with reduced stunting  these effects are only partially mediated by wealth  perhaps suggesting that some jobs may bring benefits to the household beyond the sheer acquisition of tangible resources  agricultural jobs are associated with increased malnutrition  manual labor and service work do not have an effect on malnutrition  compared to unemployment  thus  women s employment is not necessarily a mechanism for empowerment and wellbeing  not all jobs are created equal  and many of them do not confer the benefits that are typically associated with working outside the home   c  2017 elsevier inc  all rights reserved  
 are area level measures of employment associated with health behaviours and outcomes  accessible employment suited to residents  needs is an important equity issue and social determinant of health and wellbeing  and a balanced jobs housing ratio within a region has the potential to provide health benefits  this paper aims to provide evidence on the associations between employment and health  and the potential pathways  as well as identifying spatial indicators that can be used to measure urban employment  a construct of liveability  we used 2011 census data to create and test two area level spatial measures of urban employment with geo coded population health behaviour and outcome data  2011 vichealth survey  in 5206 employed adults living in urban victoria  australia  those living in areas with higher levels of local employment had reduced odds of a longer commute  or 0 87   the odds of a longer commute time was also greater for those who lived in an area where more people commuted to work by private vehicle  or 1 20   and less for those who lived in local areas where more people travelled to work by public transport  or 0 85  or active travel  or 0 80   the odds of reporting longer sitting times was less for those who lived in a local area where more people commuted to work by private vehicle  or 0 65   those who had a longer commute times  regardless of travel mode  had greater odds of reporting more sitting during a typical weekday  or 1 67   in turn  those who spent more time sitting had significantly greater odds of reporting poorer self rated health  or 1 34   such work provides evidence to policy makers to help build the argument for which area level attributes are needed to support urban employment across a region  
 are daughters like mothers  evidence on intergenerational educational mobility among young females in india taking data from the  india youth survey  situation and needs  the paper examines intergenerational educational mobility for young females  vis a  vis their mothers  in india  the paper uses transition mobility matrices and mobility measures widely used in the literature on intergenerational mobility for the examination  the overall intergenerational educational mobility among the young females in india is about 0 69  the upper limit being 1   the upwards component of the overall intergenerational educational mobility is 0 55  that is  nearly four fifth of the overall   also  the intergenerational educational mobility is slightly higher in the  scheduled castes and tribes  sc st   compared to the  other backward castes  obc   as well as  others  castes  but the upward mobility is substantially higher in the  others  caste group compared to sc sts  the upward mobility among the obcs is higher than that of sc sts but lower than that of the  others  category  also  the overall mobility as well as upward mobility is higher in urban areas  moreover  there are large inter state variations with the economically and demographically poorer states having substantially lower overall as well as upward mobility than the economically and demographically advanced states  
 are icts democratizing dictatorships  new media and mass mobilization objective  this article evaluates the relationship between the degree of access to information and communication technologies  icts  and the extent of anti government protests and riots  accounting for the effects of past protest on subsequent ict access  and examines direct and indirect effects of ict diffusion on political change  method  using a cross national time series data set from 1995 through 2014  the article employs simultaneous equations using the gsem function in stata to assess these relationships  results  the results indicate that ict access at time t is conditioned on the number of anti regime mass actions four and five years earlier  they also show greater ict access corresponds with more contemporaneous anti government mass actions  conclusions  the effect of ict diffusion on political change occurs indirectly through its effect on mass actions  but may lead to either political retrogression or liberalization  ict diffusions  direct effect sustains the political status quo  the conclusion that icts serve as liberation technology remains ambiguous  
 are media at work in your neighborhood  the effects of media freedom  internet access  and information spillover on workers  rights objectives  in this study  we focus on how access to information empowers workers and pressures government and firms to improve labor conditions  methods  we consider the effects of two critical mechanisms supporting both information access and flow across borders  i e   media freedom and internet usage  on workers  rights across countries and over time using spatial models  results  the findings overall indicate that there is a spatial component associated with the degree of workers  rights in a given country  further analysis reveals that this is due at least in part to the level of media freedom and information flow across borders  conclusion  we find support for the theorized notion that the ability of workers to secure and exercise their rights to collective bargaining and freedom of association in the workplace depends on workers  awareness of labor conditions and the potential for improvement  
 are postgraduate qualifications the  new frontier of social mobility   we investigate the relationship between social origin  postgraduate degree attainment  and occupational outcomes across five british age group cohorts  we use recently available uk labour force survey data to conduct a series of logistic regressions of postgraduate  masters or doctorate  degree attainment among those with first degrees  with controls for measures of degree classification  degree subject  age  gender  ethnicity and national origin  we find a marked strengthening of the effect of class origin on degree  and occupational attainment across age cohorts  while for older generations there is little or no difference by class origin in the rates at which first degree graduates attain postgraduate degrees  those with working class origins in the youngest age group are only about 28 per cent as likely to obtain a postgraduate degree when compared with their peers from privileged origins  moreover  social origin matters more for occupational destination  even among those with postgraduate degrees  for those in younger age groups  these findings demonstrate the newly important  and increasing  role of postgraduate degrees in reproducing socio economic inequality in the wake of the substantial expansion of undergraduate and postgraduate education  our findings lend some support to the maximally maintained inequality thesis  suggesting that gains in equality of access to first degrees are indeed at risk from postgraduate expansion  
 are we committed to issues of race  institutional integrity across intercollegiate athletics the present study employs critical race theory in a critical discourse analysis of intercollegiate athletic departmental directives for high profile national collegiate athletic association member programs  consideration of institutional integrity from critical perspectives can advance a nuanced understanding and gain further insight into the sociocultural issues and move toward eliminating inequities relevant to black student athlete stakeholders in the arena of intercollegiate athletics  the purpose of this research was to investigate the implicit function and perpetuation of contemporary racism in intercollegiate athletic organizations  as they strategically address institutional integrity  a discussion of the findings are organized by two emergent themes   a  little skin in the game  and  b  run of the mill colorblindness  this paper concludes with implications for college sport and future research of intercollegiate athletics at the intersection of higher education  
 area social deprivation and public health  analyzing the spatial non stationary associations using geographically weighed regression the prevalence of non communicable chronic diseases  ncds  worldwide poses an alarming threat to public health  recent literature has embraced the opinion that incorporating the social factors should advance the understanding of ncds prevalence  in this context  examining the ncds prevalence in association with area social deprivation should provide critical implications for coping with public health risks  however  few empirical studies have examined this specific issue  especially in the developing countries  using the principal component analysis  an area social deprivation index  asdi  is established for the shenzhen city  china  by integrating ten indicators from four dimensions  education  housing  socially disadvantaged population  and economically disadvantaged population  the geographically weighted regression  gwr  is employed to analyze the associations between asdi and the incidence rate of three prevalent ncds at district scale  spatial non stationary relationships are identified for the three diseases  more specifically  prevalence of the three diseases is all positively correlated with the asdi  strength of the associations presents the geography that it generally decreases from the central city to the suburb  these findings suggest that greater possibility of ncds prevalence would be expected in districts with higher social deprivation  besides  the impact of social deprivation on ncds prevalence is much stronger in the central city  the spatial stationarity can facilitate the formulation of location specific preventive measurements  this paper is believed to provide an innovative insight for social indicators research  
 arguments for exception in us security discourse in his influential state of exception  giorgio agamben proposes that  even in apparently liberal western democracies  the state will routinely use the contingency of national emergency to suspend civil liberties and justify expansion of military and police powers  we investigated rhetorical strategies deployed in the web pages of us security agencies  created or reformed in the aftermath of the 9 11 events  to determine whether they present argumentation conforming to agamben s model  to expose rhetorical content  we examined strategies operating at two levels within our corpus  argument schemes and underlying warrants were identified through close examination of systematically selected core documents  semantic fields establishing themes of threat and danger were also explored  using automatic corpus tools to expose patterns of lexical selection established across the whole corpus  the study recovered evidence of rhetoric broadly consistent with the logic predicted by state of exception theory  but also presented nuanced findings whose interpretation required careful re appraisal of core ideas within agamben s work

 at the intersection of criminal justice involvement and sexual orientation  dynamic networks and health among a population based sample of young black men who have sex with men mass incarceration of young black men has a significant impact on their network composition and stability that  in turn  may have major implications for health and well being  a sub group of young black men with criminal justice involvement  cji  identify as gay  bisexual or are non identified men who have sex with men  hereafter msm   this paper focuses on the potential effects of cji on the composition of black msm social and sexual networks  their stability over time  and concomitant health and social outcomes  we use data from the uconnect study  a population based cohort of young black msm 16 29 years of age  n   618  selected using respondent  driven sampling in chicago from 2013 to 2016  both confidant and sexual network name generators and interpreters were administered at 9 month intervals over three waves of data collection  ego and dyadic level data were collected on behaviors prevalent among msm and including factors associated with network cji  network stability  and health outcomes  generalized structural equation models  gsem  were utilized to determine the relationship between cji network composition  network stability and behaviors prevalent among young black msm and their networks  in the uconnect cohort  46  had at least once been detained  arrested or spent time in jail or prison  in addition  20  of participants reported incident cji over the study period  respondents with a history of cji were significantly more likely to have cji homophily in their confidant and sexual networks  multivariate analyses demonstrate that the association between one s history of cji  housing instability and drug use is partially explained by one s network cji  in addition  a higher prevalence of network cji is associated with increased turnover in the confidant network  and this network instability is also related to important health and social outcomes  this analysis describes the networks of criminal justice involved men among a representative sample of young black msm and demonstrates the relationship between cji network homophily  network stability and their impact on several key health and social outcomes relevant to this population   c  2017 elsevier b v  all rights reserved  
 athletes and or activists  lebron james and black lives matter as one of the world s most recognizable athletes  cleveland cavaliers superstar lebron james is emblematic of the modern athlete activist  as such  it is important to understand how the media frame him in the context of a controversial issue  in recent years  he has used it to quietly support the black lives matter movement  in 2014  12 year old tamir rice was killed by police on a cleveland playground  just miles from where the cavaliers play and just north of james s hometown of akron  james declined to comment on the case  and a twitter campaign nojusticenolebronattempted to force his hand  this article examines the role of james as an athlete activist  identifying four frames embedded in content around james and the black lives matter movement  brand lebron  established voice  higher expectations  attention  not aggression  and community versus protest  we found james is cautious and deliberate in his activism  moderating a message of consideration rather than revolution  contextualized by his brand and ambitions  
 attachment to god  tenure  race  and participation in congregational life the vitality of religious congregations is dependent on how effectively they attract congregants and mobilize participation  and people are more likely to participate when they share similar characteristics with other congregants  this study suggests attachment to god is a fundamental  behavioral and intrapersonal characteristic  which distinguishes participants from one another  contributing to varying levels of participation in congregational and religious life beyond service attendance  using a national sample  we test several hypotheses related to this theoretical claim  findings suggest that   1  secure attachment to god is positively associated with congregational participation   2  anxious and avoidant attachment are negatively associated with participation   3  these relationships are moderated by length of time attending a particular congregation  and  4  secure attachment is associated with higher levels of participation in congregational life for blacks than it is for whites  by demonstrating a link between attachment to god and participation in congregational and religious life  this study affirms that intrapersonal characteristics structure the dynamics of religious congregations  
 attitudes towards citizen participation in elderly people unyielding attitudes towards political and social participation  however  it is still an inconclusive area of research  due to the methodological impossibility of simultaneously taking into account the joint effects of age  political generation membership  and the period under consideration  this study addresses these issues by treating age not as a continuous variable  but as a group variable  and using five quasi longitudinal samples from the world and european values surveys and the cis data bank  covering a period of almost 30 years  the results show that  when these effects are simultaneously controlled  the life cycle is not an explanatory factor for attitudes towards citizen participation  
 audiences  a decade of transformations   reflections from the cedar network on emerging directions in audience analysis in this essay  i examine the 10 years between 2004 and 2014 as a transformative  if uncertain  decade for audience analysis  faced with rapidly fragmenting media environments  next  reflecting on the research done by a 14 country network i direct   consortium on emerging directions in audience research  cedar   funded by the arts and humanities research council  united kingdom   i examine the features of this decade of transformation  paying attention to the intellectual markers that punctuate this decade and make it stand out in the history of audience studies  i focus on four pivotal axes of transformations which emerge out of the analysis conducted by the cedar network and argue that these four represent significant ways in which audience analysis has lived through an uncertain but exciting decade  these axes are audiences  changing coping strategies with hyper connected and intrusive media  audience interruptions of media content flows  the co option of audience labour  and the micro macro politics of audience action  i conclude by locating this transformative decade 2004 2014 against a longer backdrop of uncertain moments and periods of flux in the field  arguing  that not unlike those points in time  now too  audience analysis has reached a newer  more unknown  but very significant phase

 back to borders what is a border  who is a migrant  the paper uses these questions to distinguish between constructivist  marxist and postcolonial answers provided by critical border scholarship  with three aims  first  identifying common concerns and interrogating divergent trajectories  the paper offers a practical invitation to dialogue between these various positions  second  it evidences how critical border scholarship follows a social to spatial analytical trajectory to answer these questions  borders and migration function as a spatial confirmation of a pre defined ontology of the social  as this is deemed unsatisfactory  third  the paper proposes turning this analytical trajectory on its head by going back to borders  i e  by studying the spatial manifestations of borders and migration to investigate how the social is heterogeneously configured in place specific and embodied settings  the paper argues that what is left after these debates is the need to focus on actual social hierarchies  as opposed to epistemological ones  
 backpackers  the need for reconceptualisation indubitably  an eclectic body of academic literature exists on backpacking dating back from the start of the 1990s  however  the characterisation of backpackers in several studies points evidently to incongruities among researchers  consequently  there is as yet no standard operational criteria for defining backpackers  ergo  this paper reviews the existing literature in tourism and rouses the need to rethink the definition of a backpacker for valid data gathering   c  2017 elsevier ltd  all rights reserved  
 balancing medical accuracy and diagnostic consequences  diagnosing medically unexplained symptoms in primary care focusing on the case of medically unexplained symptoms  mus   this article explores diagnostic classification in the absence of biomedical evidence or other strong medical warrants for diagnosis  the data are from three focus group interviews with norwegian general practitioners  gps  conducted in 2015  that centred on the issue of what diagnoses to use  or not  for mus  the qualitative analysis reconstructs the logic underlying gps  diagnostic accounts  which centred on the meaning of diagnostic categories and on anticipating how generalised others  would respond to those meanings  called diagnosing by anticipation    the analysis suggests that gps confer diagnoses by balancing unwarranted medical accuracy and anticipated harmful diagnostic consequences  the goal of diagnosis was finding categories in the international classification of primary care that would yield acceptable results  without making a liar of the gp in the process  drawing on the distinction between diagnosis as colligation and classification  the findings and their relevance for medical sociology are discussed  counter to frequent descriptions as illness that cannot be diagnosed   the analysis shows how gps can diagnose mus in the bureaucratic sense of diagnosis as classification   a sense that has been missing from sociological view  
 balancing the scales  negotiating father s parental leave use studying couples who shared parental leave presents the opportunity to explore decision making processes that may challenge conventional care arrangement typical of early parenthood  interviews with 33 canadian heterosexual couples indicate gendered sticking points in the division of official leave time  whether fathers took leave because of their personal desires or material circumstances  this study finds that men and women did not enter negotiations on a level playing field  strong cultural support for mothers  but not fathers  time with baby tipped the scales toward maternal care giving  even when couples wanted to share parental leave  nevertheless  financial considerations such as a man s topped up pay or woman s career could lessen the weight of mothers  moral entitlement to the leave time by presenting couples with an alternative logic on which to base their decision making  
 barriers to women s progress after atrocity  evidence from rwanda and bosnia herzegovina researchers have recently documented the unexpected opportunities war can present for women  while acknowledging the devastating effects of mass violence  this burgeoning field highlights war s potential to catalyze grassroots mobilization and build more gender sensitive institutions and legal frameworks  rwanda and bosnia herzegovina serve as important examples of this phenomenon  yet a closer examination of both cases reveals the limits on women s capacity to take part in and benefit from these postwar shifts  this article makes two key contributions  first  it demonstrates how the postwar political settlement created hierarchies of victimhood that facilitated new social divisions and fractured women s collective organizing  second  it argues that while war creates certain opportunities for women  a revitalization of patriarchy in the aftermath can undermine these gains  drawing on more than 250 interviews with women in both countries  this article ultimately questions the extent to which postwar mobilization can be maintained or harnessed for genuine gender emancipation  
 bayesian adaptive lasso for ordinal regression with latent variables we consider an ordinal regression model with latent variables to investigate the effects of observable and latent explanatory variables on the ordinal responses of interest  each latent variable is characterized by correlated observed variables through a confirmatory factor analysis model  we develop a bayesian adaptive lasso procedure to conduct simultaneous estimation and variable selection  nice features including empirical performance of the proposed methodology are demonstrated by simulation studies  the model is applied to a study on happiness and its potential determinants from the inter university consortium for political and social research  
 bayesian analysis and design for joint modeling of two binary responses with misclassification survey data are often subject to various types of errors such as misclassification  in this article  we consider a model where interest is simultaneously in two correlated response variables and one is potentially subject to misclassification  a motivating example of a recent study of the impact of a sexual education course for adolescents is considered  a simulation based sample size determination scheme is applied to illustrate the impact of misclassification on power and bias for the parameters of interest  
 behind the scenes of sport for development  perspectives of executives of multinational sport organizations this article reports findings from a study designed to examine cricket s role as an international development tool   with a particular focus on how decisions are made at the highest institutional levels to support cricket related development initiatives  data for the study are drawn from interviews with executives in the international cricket council and the marylebone cricket club who were asked about how and why decision makers in their organizations chose to engage in development related work  the study is informed by literature on postcolonialism  sport for development and peace  global politics and the sociology of cricket  the results illustrate that   a  a select group of executives in the international cricket council and the marylebone cricket club make decisions hierarchically  and that decisions reflect organizational mandates   b  decision makers tend to be dismissive of critiques of sport for development and peace  with notable exceptions  and  c  the goals and implications of development related programmes are portrayed differently to different audiences  this article concludes with commentary on the ways that cricket continues to be implicated in postcolonial relationships and on the processes of decision making in organizations governed by neoliberal policies  
 being seen  an exploration of a core phenomenon of human existence and its normative dimensions this essay explores the nature of being visible and its normative dimensions  in a first part  core traits of an anthropology of visibility are sketched  drawing mainly on hans blumenberg s phenomenological studies  in a second part  human visibility is investigated regarding its implications for our self understanding  for our relation to others  and for the publicness of our existence  apart from blumenberg  also jean paul sartre  charles taylor  hannah arendt are involved in this examination  in a third part  two  basic rights  are brought into focus  the right to be seen and the right to remain unseen  in addition to the philosophical exploration  texts by ralph ellison  elena ferrante and dave eggers are discussed as literary references  in a fourth part  a performance by marina abramovic that thematised the connection of visibility and recognition is introduced and analysed  
 between law and transnational social movement organizations  stabilizing expectations of global public goods this article draws on niklas luhrnann s theory and method to present transnational social movement organizations as a solution to the problem of increased expectations of global public goods which fail to find adequate accommodation in law  as a concrete example of the limits of law in this respect  it examines the non liquet of the world court on the question of the illegality of nuclear weapons  the trajectory of anti nuclear norms is traced beyond the limits of law to the alternative structure of transnational social movement organizations  and the article presents such organizations as stabilizing increased expectations of global public goods through their recursive decision making and their capacity to continuously project those expectations at the legal and political systems  this generates observations on the concept of  global governance   the structural relations between global civil society and international law  and the role of this form of organization in the evolution of the global political system  
 beyond collective violence  capturing context and complexity in palestinian diasporic resistance approximately 50 percent of the world s palestinians reside in the diaspora  territorially disconnected from occupied palestine  but no less part of a population so often associated with political resistance  this article asks  how do palestinians living in the uk express resistance to the military occupation of their homeland  in what ways are such expressions of resistance shaped by social processes specific to such a context  it makes the case for a more nuanced analysis of resistance amongst palestinians living in the uk  framed by understandings of  post colonialism  through a qualitative analysis of ethnographic interviews with palestinians residing in manchester and edinburgh in 2013  i begin by outlining a postcolonial context in the uk characterized by an orientalism that palestinians are forced to negotiate  i then spotlight  storytelling  as an important instance of everyday resistance within  post colonial settings  suggesting that storytelling might allow palestinians to negotiate their resistance against the various constraints of life in the uk  the findings challenge notions of  violence  and collectivity traditionally associated with palestinian resistance  pointing towards a need to reconceptualize everyday diasporic resistance in light of often complex  context specific interactions  
 beyond color blindness   re  theorizing racial ideology the study of color blind racial ideology has made a significant contribution to the understanding of contemporary racism through its elaboration of the dominant racial ideologya worldview grounded in the claim that race no longer matters as an obstacle to success in a postracial united states  despite  or perhaps as a result of this success  the study of color blind racial ideology has in many ways become stagnant  following a critique of the current state of theorizing color blindness  i strive to lay the foundation for a broader framework for understanding racial ideology  in this article  i undertake three core tasks  first  to present a general framework for understanding racial ideologies as fluid and dynamic constructions that are linked to a racial system  second  to outline how color blind racial ideology is evolving and adapting in response to political challenges and changing social conditions  and finally  to discuss challenges to the hegemony of color blindness and to propose an agenda for research on the future direction of racial ideology  
 beyond coping  smallholder intensification in southern ukraine this article empirically investigates rural  small scale household farming in post soviet southern ukraine  focusing on a particular group of households that have managed to intensify their production beyond subsistence without help from large farms  large farm support for small scale household agricultural production in the former soviet union is generally considered necessary for small scale household farming  so the absence of this support is noteworthy  the conditions of this intensification are explored and mapped out  further  this intensification is related to discussions in the peasant study literature on the general viability of intensive smallholder production  while the investigated farms do present some sustainability concerns  this paper concludes that this production is not less viable than large scale agricultural production  the main future challenge is how upcoming agrarian reforms will affect smallholders  particularly with respect to formalising informal resource use  
 beyond food security  women s experiences of urban agriculture in cape town urban agriculture is an important source of food and income throughout africa  the majority of cultivators on the continent are women who use urban agriculture to provide for their family  much research on urban agriculture in africa focuses on the material benefits of urban agriculture for women  but a smaller body of literature considers its social and psychological empowering effects  the present study seeks to contribute to this debate by looking at the ways in which urban agriculture empowers women on the cape flats  a region of cape town where urban agriculture is supported by nongovernmental organisations  ngos   based on interviews with cultivators  the findings show that ngo run urban agriculture projects not only aid food security  but also help women to develop supportive networks that unlock benefits across the personal  social and economic spectrum  
 beyond guidelines  discretionary practice in face to face triage nursing this article draws on ethnographic data from a norwegian emergency primary care clinic  epcc  to explore nurses  discretionary application of guidelines  specifically  it analyses nurses  discretionary use of the manchester triage system  mts  when performing face to face triage  that is  assessing the urgency of patients  complaints  the analysis shows how nurses assessed patients at odds with mts prescriptions by collecting supplementary data  engaging in differential diagnostic and holistic reasoning  relying on emotion and intuition  and allowing colleagues and patients to influence their reasoning  the findings also show how nurses  reasoning led them to override guidelines both overtly and covertly  based on this evidence  it is argued that nurses  assessments relied more on internalised triage mindlines  than on codified triage guidelines  although the mts did function as a support system  checklist and system for supervisory control  the study complements existing research on standardisation in nursing by providing an in depth analysis of nurses  methods for navigating guidelines and by detailing how deviations from those guidelines spring from their clinical reasoning  the challenges of imposing a managerial logic on professional labour are also highlighted  which is of particular relevance in light of the drive towards standardisation in modern healthcare  
 beyond orphanhood  parental nonresidence and child well being in tanzania this article used data from the rufiji health and demographic surveillance system in tanzania to examine the influence of parental nonresidence on child survival and school entry  using survival analysis methods  the article tested variations by parent and by cause  examining parental death  nonresidence because of parental relationship status  and migration  in general  maternal nonresidence was more consequential for child survival  whereas paternal nonresidence influences school entry  this is consistent with gendered parenting patterns in the setting  there was important variation by cause and by outcome  particularly for paternal nonresidence  paternal nonresidence because of nonmarital birth was associated with increased risk of child death  whereas paternal migration was associated with improved survival  paternal death and migration were associated with lower odds of school entry  this article moves beyond orphanhood to consider multiple causes of parental nonresidence simultaneously  demonstrating that parental nonresidence is not uniformly deleterious for children  
 bid rigging networks and state corporate crime in the construction industry this study highlights the symbiotic relationship that may arise between political and business actors in conspiracies organized around public construction bids  based on a core periphery social network analysis  the study tracks the emergence of such a conspiracy in the city of laval  canada  by illustrating the evolution of bid rigging networks revolving around suspected and persistent acts of corruption  bid rigging  and bribery  to assess this process  the study monitors irregular bidding indicators across a data set compiled from more than 7000 public construction tenders that were processed by the city from 1966 to 2013  findings reveal that firms suspected of bid rigging activities were perennial core participants largely as a result of a state corporate crime system that served as the guiding force for agreements between the main construction entrepreneurs   c  2016 elsevier b v  all rights reserved  
 bifurcated conversations in sociological studies of religion and gender feminist sociologists claim that while feminist insights have been incorporated in sociological paradigms and women sociologists have been well integrated into academia  sociological frameworks have not been transformed  a process known as the missing feminist revolution  yet  few have examined how the missing feminist revolution operates in specific subdisciplines and the mechanisms that sustain it  this article undertakes these tasks by analyzing religion and gender scholarship published in six sociology journals over the past 32 years  we find evidence of partial integration and continued marginalization  however  we also document disparate networks of interlocutors that operate in two distinct intellectual fieldsreligion and gender  we argue that this bifurcation partially explains the missing feminist revolution and that insularity of feminist conversations likely contributes to this process  our findings shed light on obstacles to transforming mainstream disciplines  
 biography and discourse  a biography and discourse analysis combining case study on women s involvement in national socialism the article is based on a case study that combines biography research with discourse analysis  the research question is  how  post 1945  might austrian women who were involved in national socialism use a gendered victim discourse as a pattern of interpretation to deal with their biographical experiences during national socialism  as a first step  the article outlines the methodological approach employed  the use of a combination of biographical and discourse analysis takes into account the fact that biographies are structured by discourses and prepares the ground for the analysis of biographical accounts as everyday discourses  in this specific case  the discourse analysis reveals that a particular discourse called a gendered victim discourse allows national socialism to be forgotten  at the same time  however  the case reconstruction of three biographies shows that the women do not use the gendered victim discourse as a discursive interpretation of national socialism in their biographical accounts  concerning this result the article argues that biographical significant experiences of events during national socialism that remained meaningful after 1945 cannot simply be forgotten   the appropriation of a discursive pattern of interpretation is selective and depends on biographical structures  
 biopolitics and the  complementary heterogeneity  of migratory flows in italy this article focuses on the links and interdependences between new trends in post fordist globalization and the current direction of migration flows and migrants  projects in italy  on the one hand  thousands of migrants are arriving as stowaways or asylum seekers due to political and economic tensions from the syrian crisis and elsewhere in the arab world  at the same time  an increasing number of highly skilled youths are leaving italy in order to seek insertion in more dynamic knowledge based economies  informed by foucault s approach to biopolitics  this work critically considers the  complementary heterogeneity  of these migratory flows as a focal point and examines them in the structural context produced by the post 2007 crisis  
 bodily integrity  embodiment  and the regulation of parental choice in this article we develop a new model of bodily integrity that we designate embodied integrity   we deploy it to argue that non therapeutic interventions on children should be considered within a decision making framework that prioritizes embodied integrity  this would counter the excessive decision making power that law currently accords to parents  protecting the child s immediate and future interests  focusing on legal responses to genital cutting  we suggest that current legal understandings of bodily integrity are impoverished and problematic  by contrast  adoption of an embodied integrity  model carves out a space for children s rights  while avoiding these negative consequences  we propose that embodied integrity should trump competing values in any best interests assessment where a non therapeutic intervention is requested  drawing on drucilla cornell and joel feinberg s theories we argue that protecting a child s embodied integrity is essential to guarantee his her right to make future embodied choices and become a fully individuated person  
 boosting trust by facilitating communication  a model of trustee investments in information sharing trust problems hamper many social and economic exchanges  in such situations  there are often institutions that enable trustors to share information on the performance of trustees  while the benefits of such institutions have been researched extensively  little is known about their emergence  this article presents a game theoretic model for the understanding of investments by trustees in establishing information sharing between trustors  the model allows for a simultaneous analysis of investments in and effects of institutions for information sharing  it captures two mechanisms by which a trustee s investment can promote trust  first  a trustee s investment in establishing information sharing can enable network effects that facilitate trust and trustworthiness  second  it can promote trust by serving as a signal of intrinsic trustworthiness  the analysis of the model implies predictions for how characteristics of the interaction situation affect whether these mechanisms motivate a trustee to establish information sharing  
 brahmanism  its place in ancient indian society this article shows how brahmanism was a regional tradition  confined to the northwestern parts of the indian subcontinent  that passed through a difficult periodwhich it barely survivedroughly between the time of alexander and the beginning of the common era  it then reinvented itself  in a different shape  no longer primarily a sacrificial tradition  it became a mainly socio political ideology that borrowed much  including the belief in rebirth and karmic retribution  from the eastern region in which buddhism and jainism had arisen  its revival went hand in hand with the elaboration of behavioural and theoretical innovations  one of whose purposes was to justify the claimed superiority of brahmins  
 branded fitness  exercise and promotional culture this article develops a theory of branded fitness within the united states through a focus on two of its most visible examples  crossfit and bikram yoga  we argue that highly successful forms of branded fitness such as these give insight into the enormous power and permeation of branded sensibilities into everyday life   in this case  going so far as to inform how we relate to  and attempt to modify  our own bodies  however  we argue that a close examination of branded fitness likewise reveals the inconsistencies  trouble spots  and extraordinary limits of the brand as a way to build a fitness movement   which we contend is instructive in thinking about how branding more generally relates to mediation  community  and cultural commodification  
 brexit  trump  and  methodological whiteness   on the misrecognition of race and class the rhetoric of both the brexit and trump campaigns was grounded in conceptions of the past as the basis for political claims in the present  both established the past as constituted by nations that were represented as white  into which racialized others had insinuated themselves and gained disproportionate advantage  hence  the resonant claim that was broadcast primarily to white audiences in each place to take our country back   the politics of both campaigns was also echoed in those social scientific analyses that sought to focus on the legitimate  claims of the left behind  or those who had come to see themselves as strangers in their own land   the skewing of white majority political action as the action of a more narrowly defined white working class served to legitimize analyses that might otherwise have been regarded as racist  in effect  i argue that a pervasive methodological whiteness  has distorted social scientific accounts of both brexit and trump s election victory and that this needs to be taken account of in our discussion of both phenomena  
 bridging the discursive gap between lay and medical discourse in care coordination for older people with multiple chronic co morbidities  strategies to coordinate care depend heavily on information exchange  we analyse the information sharing difficulties arising from differences between patients  oral narratives and medical sense making  and whether a modified form of narrative medicine  might mitigate them  we systematically compared 66 general practice patients  own narratives of their health problems and care with the contents of their clinical records  data were collected in england during 2012 13  patients  narratives differed from the accounts in their medical record  especially the summary  regarding mobility  falls  mental health  physical frailty and its consequences for accessing care  parts of patients  viewpoints were never formally encoded  parts were lost when clinicians de coded it  parts supplemented  and sometimes the whole narrative was re framed  these discrepancies appeared to restrict the patient record s utility even for gps for the purposes of risk stratification  case management  knowing what other care givers were doing  and coordinating care  the findings suggest combining the encoding decoding theory of communication with inter subjectivity and intentionality theories as sequential  complementary elements of an explanation of how patients communicate with clinicians  a revised form of narrative medicine might mitigate the discursive gap and its consequences for care coordination  
 bringing  internationalization at home  opportunities to community colleges  design and assessment of an online exchange activity between us and japanese students increasing college students  exposure to global contexts and improving their intercultural competency remain challenging educational objectives  especially at the community college level  fortunately  the recent shift in higher education from study abroad opportunities toward so called internationalization at home initiatives  where students interact with people from cultures outside their own while remaining on their home campuses  offers new options  in this article  we describe a virtual exchange activity that we conducted between our sociology courses at a community college in the united states and two universities in japan  we show through our assessment of the students  experiences that a well coordinated  carefully crafted  technology enhanced internationalization at home activity has the potential to offer important global learning opportunities and intercultural competency development for sociology students who may otherwise lack the means to participate in study abroad  
 bringing about the global movement for the rights of nature  sites and practices for intelligibility legal scholars  environmental organizations  indigenous groups and activists from around the world are energizing an emergent global movement on the rights of nature  to face the environmental crisis  these heterogeneous actors are coming together to reconceptualize nature as a legal subject  in this article  i examine democracy schools and awakening the dreamer symposia  ads  to establish where and how this emergent movement is being organized  the meaning structures  knowledge stocks and identity cues that characterize it are made intelligible to potential adherents through these seminars and workshops  interpretive analysis reveals that democracy schools and adss are distinctively mobile and replicable infrastructures  the concept of stagings  was developed to help examine cultural and spatial dynamics in heterogeneous and extensive collective action  
 building an audience  bonding a city  digital news production as a field of care cities act as shared social structures that shape citizen identity  these bonds are solidified through fields of care  in which residents are tied to the city by both geographic space and emotional attachment  pre digital scholarship established that news production acts as a field of care  strengthening relationships to the urban environment  this research revisits news production as a field of care in the digital age  driven by an ecological approach to news production informed by the historic works of chicago school sociologists  this study examines how new orleans operates as a news environment to build news audiences and bond urban residents to the city  built upon a complement of qualitative methods including 49 in depth interviews with media practitioners  ethnographic observation  and document analysis  this work advances that the city s news ecology rests upon notions of publicness and spectacle to connect with audiences  this study finds that even in the digital age  ties to the physical community remain essential to engaging digital news audiences within metropolitan spaces  
 building soft skills in the creative economy  creative intermediaries  business support and the  soft skills gap  in recent years  the uk government and policymakers have sought to maximise the impact of the creative economy via a programme of targeted intervention  intermediary agencies those organisations that sit between government and policymakers on one hand  and creative practitioners and microbusinesses on the other   are increasingly seen as crucial to the functioning of the creative economy  this article reports on the activities of one creative intermediary   cultural enterprise office based in glasgow  scotland  ceo s remit is to help creatives become more  businesslike   and they provide or facilitate access to training and skills development  the article draws on interviews conducted with ceo staff and clients  and ethnographic material gathered from observation of ceo s working practices  i explore how creatives narrativise their personal and professional development in relation to intermediaries  and demonstrate the tension at the core of ceo s practice between their remit to support a skills and employability agenda and their understanding of the limitations of this agenda  i also explore the emotional component of business support  which arises in response to the extreme individualisation associated with creative work  and the precarious working conditions that creatives face  the rationale for writing this article stems from the fact that the creative economy is now a globalised concept  with many countries looking to the uk for guidance on growing the sector  yet little is known about what services creatives draw down from intermediaries  why and when  or how they understand the role of intermediaries  
 calculating a gpi for liaoning province of china the conventional equation of economic well being with the gross domestic product  gdp  has dominated policy thinking for at least 50 years  however  a variety of authors have pointed to the social and environmental costs of economic development and called for more comprehensive and more representative measures of progress to be developed  therefore  a variety of  adjusted  indicators have been developed  the robustness and reliability of these indicators is still a contentious issue  but these attempts raise important questions about sustainable development and pose an important challenge to conventional thinking about the relationship between economic progress  well being and sustainability  the genuine progress indicator  gpi  is one of the indicators of measuring sustainable development  apply it to liaoning province  this paper evaluates liaoning s gpi from 1978 to 2011  gpi  per capita gpi and gdp of liaoning are compared with each other  it is concluded that gdp and per capita gdp of liaoning grow much faster than gpi and per capita gpi  grouped all components of gpi into three categories  economy  environment and social   it shows that social and environmental development lags behind economic growth in liaoning  this paper is till now a unique application of gpi indicator in liaoning and china s provincial level and also contribution to the continuing development of the methods and results for the index of genuine progress indicator  gpi   policy implications are given finally  
 campaigning in the fourth age of political communication  a multi method study on the use of facebook by german and austrian parties in the 2013 national election campaigns starting from the contribution to the discussion on a fourth age of political communication  here we argue that  as a consequence of how the web 2 0 has changed political campaigns  the theoretical time bound three phase models of political campaigning must be reconsidered  we propose four ideal campaign types based on their ideal typical target audience  partisan   mass   target group  and individual centered campaigns  in reality  each campaign combines elements of all types  to examine this mixture empirically  we apply a most similar systems design and investigate five german and six austrian parties  use of facebook in the 2013 national election campaigns  on the basis of face to face interviews with the campaign managers and a quantitative content analysis of the respective parties  facebook pages  we analyze how parties used facebook as a campaigning tool to inform  interact with  and mobilize voters  as well as which target audiences they addressed  we find that  although the campaign managers declare facebook their most important web 2 0 campaigning tool  the german and austrian parties did not make use of facebook s interactive and mobilizing potential  rather relying on mass centered information  possibly due to the framework conditions in both countries  based on our findings  we conclude that the role of context for election campaigning should be discussed more carefully  
 can we trust measures of political trust  assessing measurement equivalence in diverse regime types do standard  trust in government  survey questions deliver measures which are reliable and equivalent in meaning across diverse regime types  i test for the measurement equivalence of political trust in a sample of 35 former soviet and european countries using the 2010 life in transition survey ii conducted by the world bank and european bank for reconstruction and development  employing multiple group confirmatory factor analysis  i find that trust perceptions in central political institutions differ from  1  trust in regional and local political institutions   2  trust in protective institutions like the armed forces and police and  3  trust in order institutions like the courts and police  four measurement models achieve partial metric invariance and two reach partial scalar invariance in most countries  allowing for comparisons of correlates using latent factors from each model  i also found some clustering of measurement error and variation in the dimensionality of political trust between democratic and autocratic portions of the sample  on some measurement parameters  therefore  respondents in diverse cultures and regime types do not have equivalent understandings of political trust  the findings offer both optimism and a note of caution for researchers using political trust measures in cross regime contexts  
 canada and the global rush for international students  reifying a neo imperial order of western dominance in the knowledge economy era in a global knowledge economy  western nations compete for the best knowledge workers  while positioning english language and western education as superior  drawing from critical theories of globalization  we argue that the international education field has become a site to maintain a neo imperial agenda concealed by a neoliberal rhetoric of progress and economic expediency  using canada as a case study  we critically examine the global tactics of power and governance strategies in international education policy  as they influence and shape education and immigration policy within canada  we illustrate how the oecd positions itself for global dominance in education and  re produces the international education field using tactics such as rescaling  the policy cycle and  self responsibilizing  students  this process creates and maintains a global market for knowledge producers and expands the soft power of western nations  
 capturing the consumption of distance  a practice theoretical investigation of everyday travel this article contributes to current debates on  un sustainable mobility by re conceptualising everyday travel as a set of consumption practices  treating physical mobility as consumption of distance  with considerable social  ecological and economic consequences  the article s theoretical focus moves beyond conventional approaches that have hitherto dominated transport research and policy in europe and beyond  in addition  it demonstrates how a carefully operationalised practice theoretical approach can shed new light on the social and material contingency of human  travel  behaviour  by transforming qualitative evidence from ireland into an innovative typology of commuting practices  this article captures the importance of intermeshing social and material contexts for people s everyday consumption of distance  overall  we seek to add to the already significant body of literature that evaluates the suitability of practice theoretical core concepts to the empirical study of everyday life  
 catholics and atheists  a cross cultural qualitative analysis of religious identities among gay men in parallel bodies of research  scholars have explored the relationship between religion  immigration  and sexuality  either by investigating the effects of immigration on the religious practice or its effect on sexual minorities  relationship with organized religion  this study bridges these two literatures and examines how immigration affects the religious identities of two groups of polish gay men one from warsaw  poland  and the other from chicago  usa  based on 53 in depth interviews  it demonstrates how the larger religious environments in the two countries conditions respondents  individual stances toward religion  the religious environment in predominately catholic poland is hostile toward homosexuals  compelling gay respondents who are critical of the church to choose sides and adopt atheist or agnostic identities  in contrast  the gay respondents in chicago find themselves in a religiously pluralistic and immigrant society  which allows them to retain their religious tradition and catholic identity alongside their identity as gay men  
 caught between restrictions and freedom  narrative biographies shed light on how gendered structures and processes affect the drop out of females from universities this article focuses on the topic of gender segregation at universities in german speaking countries  it addresses the question how the interrelation of organizational structures and individual biographies leads to the drop out of females during their phd  moreover  it contributes to the understanding of how these drop outs are embedded in gendered organizational structures and processes  a case study approach is applied in order to gain a deeper understanding of the crucial mentor mentee relationship at this career stage  the detailed reconstruction of narrative biographies shows how a young female researcher faces too many restrictions and too much freedom at the same time  results revealed how the female junior is highly dependent on the male senior and that specific assignments of how and with whom to work impact her career development  at the same time  the evaluation of the junior s work is based on the stereotypical picture of an autonomous scientist who produces excellent research results without senior interference  findings are explained in line with the theory of trajectory curves  and demonstrate the long term and complex process of the unplanned drop out of a female researcher in a male dominated environment with gendered structures and processes  
 causes and consequences of the rise of populist radical right parties and movements in europe this article reviews three strands in the scholarship on the populist radical right  prr   it covers both political parties and extra parliamentary mobilization in contemporary european democracies  after definitional issues and case selection  the authors first discuss demand side approaches to the fortunes of the prr  subsequently  supply side approaches are assessed  namely political opportunity explanations and internal supply side factors  referring to leadership  organization and ideological positioning  third  research on the consequences of the emergence and rise of these parties and movements is examined  do they constitute a corrective or a threat to democracy  the authors discuss the growing literature on the impact on established parties  policies  the policies themselves  and citizens  behaviour  the review concludes with future directions for theorizing and research  
 challenge and relief  a foucauldian disciplinary analysis of retirement from professional association football in the united kingdom the aim of this study was to consider the retirement experiences of british male professional association footballers by utilising foucault s analysis of discipline discussed in discipline and punish  the birth of the prison  specifically  we drew upon foucault to consider how  through the various techniques and instruments of discipline  the professional football context produces docile footballing bodies  and how this might influence a player s experiences in retirement  we gathered our empirical material using a foucauldian informed interview framework with 25 former professional male football players between the ages of 21 and 34  our analysis suggested that retirement from football was both a challenge and a relief for our participants  and that their extended period of time within football s strong disciplinary apparatus significantly influenced how they experienced their retirement  
 challenging global geographies of power  sending children back to nigeria from the united kingdom for education west africans have a long history of investing in their children s education by sending them to britain  yet  some young british nigerians are being sent to nigeria for secondary education  going against a long historical grain  the movement of children from london to nigeria is about the making of good subjects who possess particular cultural dispositions and behave in such a manner as to ensure educational success and the reproduction of middle class subjectivities within neoliberal globalization  we maintain that this movement highlights the way in which global geographies of powerrooted in a colony metropole divideare being challenged and reconfigured  serving to provincialize the uk  through the educational choices that nigerian parents make for their children  such small acts disrupt imagined geographies and particular spatial and temporal configurations of progress and modernity  in which former colonial subjects have traveled to the metropole for education  while generating counter narratives about nigerian education  society  and economy  yet  the methods used to instill new dispositions and habits in the contemporary nigerian educational context are informed by the british educational colonial legacy of discipline through corporal punishmentphysical punishment was central to the civilizing mission of british colonial educational policy  consequently  the choice to send children to school in nigeria and other african countries both challenges global geographies of power and illuminates the continued relevance of the colonial educational legacy and its disciplinary strategies  which are  in turn  part of the broader project of modernity itself  
 change or continuity  intergenerational social mobility and post communist transition regime change experienced in post communist societies is of great significance for research in social stratification and mobility  nonetheless  the existing literature does not provide a clear answer if cross national differences in social mobility are determined by communist legacies or by the divergent paths these countries followed in their transition to the capitalist system  it is hypothesised that higher income inequality and an overall decline in material wellbeing would increase the importance of parental economic capital  whereas the relative role of parental cultural capital in offspring s life chances would decline  for 24 societies in central and eastern europe and the south caucasus  i find evidence on the decisive role of social origins  particularly parental education  in predicting individuals  educational and occupational attainment  however  significant and systematic changes in intergenerational social mobility from pre  to post transitional cohorts are not observed  the derived findings are robust to alternative specifications of social origins and destinations  arguably  differences in intergenerational links between parents  and offspring s socio economic status resulted from historical discrepancies in the communist period rather than the consequences of idiosyncratic developments in post communist transition  
 channeling hearts and minds  advocacy organizations  cognitive emotional currents  and public conversation do advocacy organizations stimulate public conversation about social problems by engaging in rational debate  or by appealing to emotions  we argue that rational and emotional styles of communication ebb and flow within public discussions about social problems due to the alternating influence of social contagion and saturation effects  these  cognitive emotional currents  create an opportunity structure whereby advocacy organizations stimulate more conversation if they produce emotional messages after prolonged rational debate or vice versa  we test this hypothesis using automated text analysis techniques that measure the frequency of cognitive and emotional language within two advocacy fields on facebook over 1 5 years  and a web based application that offered these organizations a complimentary audit of their social media outreach in return for sharing nonpublic data about themselves  their social media audiences  and the broader social context in which they interact  time series models reveal strong support for our hypothesis  controlling for 33 confounding factors measured by our facebook application  we conclude by discussing the implications of our findings for future research on public deliberation  how social contagions relate to each other  and the emerging field of computational social science  
 characteristics of first time parents in spain along the 21st century this study examines female and male first time parents in spain between 1999 and 2015  based on the labor force survey in its panel version  the probability of having a first child is controlled by age and observation period  using the independent variables of place of birth  educational attainment and employment status  results confirm a delay in first parity births for men and women having a higher education level  the continuance of a gender pattern explains the higher probability of first time maternity in unemployed women  whereas work is indispensable for being a first time father  however  inactive and temporary employment negatively affect both genders  the contribution of the immigrant population is confirmed  especially due to its early timetable  
 child care instability and behavior problems  does parenting stress mediate the relationship  child care instability is associated with more behavior problems in young children  but the mechanisms of this relationship are not well understood  theoretically  this relationship is likely to emerge  at least in part  because care instability leads to increased parenting stress  moreover  low socioeconomic status and single mother families may be more vulnerable to the effects of instability  this study tested these hypotheses using data from the fragile families and child wellbeing study  n 1 675  and structural equation modeling  three types of child care instability were examined  long term instability  multiplicity  and needing to use back up arrangements  overall  findings showed little evidence that parenting stress mediated the associations between care instability and child behavior problems among the full sample  among single mother and low income families  however  needing to use back up arrangements had small positive associations with parenting stress  which partially mediated the relationship between that type of care instability and child externalizing behavior problems  
 children and wild foods in the context of deforestation in rural malawi there is growing recognition of the contribution of wild foods to local diets  nutrition  and culture  yet disaggregation of understanding of wild food use by gender and age is limited  we used a mixed methods approach to determine the types  frequencies  and perceptions of wild foods used and sold by children in four villages in southern malawi that have different levels of deforestation  household and individual dietary diversity scores are low at all sites  all households consume one or more wild foods  across the four sites  children listed 119 wild foods  with a wider variety at the least deforested sites than the most deforested ones  older children can name more wild foods than younger ones  more children from poor households sell wild foods than from well off households  several reasons were provided for the consumption or avoidance of wild foods  most commonly taste  contribution to health  limited alternatives  hunger  availability  local taboos   
 children of the us national guard  making meaning and responding to parental deployment this qualitative study explored how 24 youths  behaviors during deployment were influenced by their perceptions of their non deployed parents  interviews were conducted with youths of previously deployed national guard parents  analysis of interviews suggests that the youths  interactions with their non deployed parents strongly influence their behaviors during deployment  examined through the lenses of family systems and symbolic interaction  youths appear to base their behaviors upon perceptions of their non deployed parents  abilities to cope and manage the changes brought about during deployment  the majority of youths report reacting in ways intended to help their parents and familieswhether by stepping up and assisting their non deployed parents  or withdrawing physically or emotionally to reduce the emotional strain on parents  implications of findings are discussed  
 choreographing the performer audience interaction the article introduces the concept of choreography  defined as situationally enacted participation and action framework that provides sequential structure for social interaction  for studying performer audience interaction during musical performances  performers develop a preferred type of interaction during a repeated series of concerts  audiences become absorbed in the choreography through participation in the concerts and the circulation of the internet videos from earlier concerts  as the audience learns to expect certain actions from the side of the performers  improvisation is required from the performers in order for the choreography to be successful  attention is paid to the methods the performers use to produce watchables and to manage the audience responses  the spatial  temporal  and gestural elements of this enacted choreography are analyzed sequentially using conversation analysis  the longitudinal data is composed of youtube concert videos of kings of convenience performing a song  i d rather dance with you

 citizen consumer revisited  the cultural meanings of organic food consumption in israel organic food consumption is associated with citizen consumer practice  which is an act of promoting different aspects of social and ecological responsibility and the integration of ethical considerations in daily practices such as eating  this article analyzes aspects of organic food consumption in israel and the symbolic meanings given to it by its consumers  the study shows how practices attributed to ethical eating culture are used in identity construction  social status manifestation  and as a means to demonstrate openness to global cultural trends  organic food consumption is carried out as part of a symbolic use of ethical values and its adaptation to the local israeli cultural context  in addition  organic food consumption patterns are revealed as fitting the cultural logic of globalization  which spread in the last decades in israel  analysis of the socio cultural aspects related to organic food consumption points to the polysemy embodied in the term citizen consumer and shows how the actual implementation of this term in israel is based on the assimilation of cosmopolitan meanings  
 clarifying the factor structure of the mental health continuum short form in three languages  a bifactor exploratory structural equation modeling approach the mental health continuum short form measures both the private and public aspects of overall positive mental health  this study explored the factor structure of english  n   324   afrikaans  n   476   and setswana  n   258  versions of the scale among culturally diverse south african students  a bifactor exploratory structural equation modeling model displayed superior fit  with the overall scale but not the subscales attaining sufficient reliability  the social integration  and social contribution  items appeared to provide a better representation of overall mental health  and psychological well being for social integration  than the intended social well being dimension  and the psychological well being items mainly represented general mental health in the african group  these findings suggest the need for a culturally sensitive clarification of the private to public continuum in the conceptualization and manifestation of eudaimonic well being  the scale exhibited partial scalar invariance across the groups  
 close social ties  socioeconomic diversity and social capital in us congregations this paper explores how various types of in church close social ties of worshipers  socio economic homogeneity of congregations and sociodemographic characteristics of their geographical locations affect worshipers  bonding social capital  church related volunteer participation  and bridging social capital  civic participation outside of church   by using the 2001 uscls data  close social ties index determines various combinations of attending with close friends  children  and or spouse  congregational homogeneity levels are measured by looking at the race  income  age and education of churchgoers  neighborhood level sociodemographic characteristics include percentages of urban population and the proportion of racial minorities  findings indicate that each type and composition of close social ties affect bonding and bridging social capital in different ways  bonding social capital is the highest when worshipers attend together with their spouses  children and close friends  bridging social capital is the highest when they attend with both spouses and close friends  but it starts to decline after the inclusion of children as the third type of tie  race and income homogeneity foster church related participation  age and education homogeneity negatively affects church related volunteerism but fosters civic participation outside  only bonding social capital is affected by neighborhood level factors  higher proportions of racial minorities in neighborhoods increase church related participation  
 collective litigation and the constitutional challenges to decriminalizing homosexuality in singapore this article examines collective legal mobilization through the courts  or collective litigation  in a non liberal regime  it analyses the emergence and development of collective litigation to challenge the constitutionality of section 377a of the penal code  the law that criminalizes same sex sexual conduct in singapore  the analysis focuses on the relational dynamics of collective litigation and legal subjectivities of the social actors involved  highlighting how social positions and strategic interests shaped their interactions and decisions on litigation  while gay rights activists emphasized their movement s collective interests when choosing the appropriate case and lawyers  a movement outsider pursued individual interests on behalf of a client  due to their divergent social positions and strategic interests  the two teams competed with each other as they initiated two separate constitutional challenges  tension between the teams led to conflict with constituents of the gay rights movement and influenced their relational dynamics with other parties  
 colorblind racism  identities  ideologies  and shifting subjectivities sociologists have recently begun to recognize the need to more deeply examine the mechanisms of contemporary colorblind racism  to move beyond frame identification and glean new insights  this is important because as racial dynamics evolve  so will the ideologies and discourses that surround them  this article considers how we might be able to untangle ideology  racism  discourse  and the material realities of our wider social systems  it also introduces the themes in this special issue that parse ideals from ideologies  that consider individual subjectivities as they emerge in different social contexts  and that examine strategies for grappling with the realities of racism  this allows us to trace the connections between colorblind ideology and racism more broadly  giving us traction to potentially use this knowledge to sharpen our resistance to racism  
 colorblindness as identity  key determinants  relations to ideology  and implications for attitudes about race and policy colorblindness is often conceptualized as a set of deeply held but unrecognized ideological tenets  however  we believe that colorblindness has also now become an explicit cultural discourse involving self conscious claims and specific convictions  to illustrate this point which has both conceptual and empirical implications we introduce the notion of colorblindness as identity  we define this concept as subjectively meaningful  self asserted identification with colorblindness  we use data from a nationally representative survey to explore the social determinants of colorblind identification and assess its relationship to both colorblind ideologies and standard attitudinal measures  we find that a relatively large percentage of americans across racial lines identify as colorblind  furthermore  such identification is connected to racial ideologies but not all tenets of colorblind racism  for white americans  colorblind identification is associated with decreased perceptions of social distance  but not support for policies designed to ameliorate the effects of racial discrimination  we conclude that colorblind identification is a unique social phenomenon  connected to views on race but not always in the ways that existing research would predict  we also suggest directions for further exploration of the depth of colorblindness as an identity form and implications for theorizing colorblind discourse more generally  
 combining capabilities and fundamental human needs  a case study with vulnerable teenagers in france in the field of human development few studies attempted to combine the capability approach originally developed by amartya sen and the fundamental human needs approach developed by manfred max neef  the goal of this paper is to combine the two approaches in order to build a dynamic and multidimensional framework of human well being  this framework enables a better description and assessment of the complexity of human well being ranging from freedom of choice to needs satisfaction  to test this framework we conducted an action research project with vulnerable teenagers who suffer severe social exclusion and educational difficulties  in order to assess subjective well being inequalities  we organized participatory workshops followed by a questionnaire survey with the vulnerable group and with a control group  the results clearly demonstrate that the group of vulnerable teenagers suffers inequalities on almost all the dimensions of well being that we tested  in sum  the theoretical reflections and the operationalization of the combined framework enables us  i  to better define and link the different concepts of capabilities  functionings  satisfiers and needs   ii  to debate further the idea of a universal list of human well being dimensions   iii  to discuss the risk of aspirations adaptation of vulnerable students   iv  to discuss the potential of needs and capabilities for improving education in a human development perspective   v  to offer a matrix compounded of ten axiological capabilities and four existential capabilities  and  vi  to formulate a new definition of sustainable human development that reconciles needs and capabilities  
 combining ethnography and surveys mixed methods research designs beyond combining qualitative interviews with quantitative surveys mixed methods researchers usually discuss how to combine qualitative and quantitative data of the same data type  typically interviews   however  mixed methods research becomes vastly more complicated  when not only standardized data are combined with more open ended data but simultaneously different data types are mixed  e  g  ethnographical data with survey data   using two examples from spatial sociology  this paper illustrates that the specific benefit of such combinations is that ethnography and surveys provide complementary information  the paper also discusses how to solve some problems typically arising in mixed methods studies with mixed data types  in particular  which mixed methods design is most suitable  strongly depends on the specific research question and the social theory used  regardless  researchers have to decide which strand of the mixed methods study is core component and which is supplemental component  
 commodification and resistance  theoretical implications drawn from a mobile recreational community drawing on interview  survey  and long term participant observational research in the bmw motorcycling community  we analyze issues related to the commodification of riding  we use hill collins s  1999  both and approach in our data analysis  specifically  we draw on adorno s  1991  and marcuse s  1964  theories of the commodification of popular culture and the power of the culture industry to market non essential products  we find that marx s  marx and engels 1988  theory of ways to attain species being have the potential to be expanded via serious leisure activities  e g   motorcycling  even as some are caught up in the discursive power of the culture industry  
 commodity fetishism and consumer senses  turn of the twentieth century consumer activism in the united states and england at the turn of the twentieth century  the national consumers  league  the co operative wholesale society  and the women s co operative guild encouraged people to become ethical consumers  i argue that we can explain their common strategies by invoking commodity fetishism  by casting their consumer activism as a practical response to the fetish of commodities  we explain  1  activists  use of sensory techniques   both figurative and literal   to connect producers  commodities  and consumers and 2  their commitment to the ethical power of the senses  this account reveals the virtues of commodity fetishism as a tool for understanding the dynamics of consumer activism  
 communication strategy on oral health education for adolescents 60 90  of children globally have gingivitis and dental caries which are the most frequent oral diseases among children  dental caries is progressive and cumulative in nature and becomes more complex over time  is necessary to have guidelines for oral health strategy s in romania because in last twenty years oral health treatment is made in most of the time in the private healthy system and scholars dental offices almost disappeared  the study took place over a 2 year period  enrolled students from three secondary schools from timisoara who strictly applied our oral health education program with our four goals  to reduce the number of carries  to reduce the gingivitis incidents  to reduce mucosal problems and to reduce the orthopedic problems  739 patients  378 girls and 361 boys  with a mean age of 13 46  sd 2 81  years were evaluated before application of the oral health education lessons  which contained more forms of communication for the presence of caries  gingivitis  diseases of the oral mucosa  and malocclusion  all patients were reevaluated after application of the oral health education lessons  after two follow up collected data  underlined a statistically significant decrease in the incidence of dental caries  gingivitis and oral mucosal diseases after implementation of our oral health program  adolescents prefer the debates to be informed about oral health and of course the modern technology  adolescents are open mind when we speak about personal information s  they prefers modern technology for information about health  but when they have oral cavity problems they have thrust more in dental doctors  school and family  they also are enthusiastic for group debates on a known theme  
 community and the crime decline  the causal effect of local nonprofits on violent crime largely overlooked in the theoretical and empirical literature on the crime decline is a long tradition of research in criminology and urban sociology that considers how violence is regulated through informal sources of social control arising from residents and organizations internal to communities  in this article  we incorporate the  systemic  model of community life into debates on the u s  crime drop  and we focus on the role that local nonprofit organizations played in the national decline of violence from the 1990s to the 2010s  using longitudinal data and a strategy to account for the endogeneity of nonprofit formation  we estimate the causal effect on violent crime of nonprofits focused on reducing violence and building stronger communities  drawing on a panel of 264 cities spanning more than 20 years  we estimate that every 10 additional organizations focusing on crime and community life in a city with 100 000 residents leads to a 9 percent reduction in the murder rate  a 6 percent reduction in the violent crime rate  and a 4 percent reduction in the property crime rate  
 community context and child health  a human capital perspective human capital theory suggests that education benefits individuals  and their children s health through the educational skills people acquire in school  this perspective may also be relevant at the community level  the greater presence of adults with educational skills in a community may be a reason why living in a more highly educated setting benefits health  i use demographic and health survey data for 30 sub saharan african countries to investigate whether the percentage of literate adultsspecifically womenin a community is associated with children s likelihood of survival  i characterize 13 785 african communities according to the prevalence of women who are literate  multilevel discrete time hazard models  n   536 781 children  confirm that living in a community where more women are literate is positively associated with child survival  the study supports the conceptualization of literacy  and potentially other educational skills  as forms of human capital that can spill over to benefit others  
 comparing child poverty risk by family structure during the 2008 recession children in nonmarried families are at greater risk for poverty and especially so during a time of macroeconomic recession  using carefully harmonized data  the authors analyze child poverty among nonmarried families before and during the 2008 recession in five liberal welfare states  australia  canada  ireland  the united kingdom  and the united states  although having similar demographic compositions  the authors document wide cross national variation in poverty risk based on marital status and gender of the household head  through the recession  child poverty in canada and the united kingdom declined while it increased in australia and ireland and was largely unchanged in the united states  decomposing changes within countries over time  family benefits in the form of income transfers play a major role in reducing poverty for nonmarried families  in all countries  children in cohabitating families were less protected from market instability  
 comparison of two indexes of measurement of xenophobia in andalusia the main purpose of this study is to compare two indexes or measures of xenophobia through a replication study  both indexes developed by diez nicolas and cea d ancona have been applied to a telephone survey questionnaire for residents of andalusian municipalities having a high density of non eu foreigners  after a descriptive  correlational and explanatory analysis of the results  the main conclusion suggests that both indices are quite similar  although based on different evaluative  theoretical and methodological principles  therefore  the selection of either index depends on the parsimony or simplicity principle  
 competition and cooperation in international commercial arbitration  the birth of a transnational legal profession this paper revisits the sociology of international commercial arbitration on the basis of unexploited archives and data  this material casts new light on the competition between grand old men and young technocrats in the 1980s and 1990s  a theme that has structured the analysis of international commercial arbitration since the pioneering work of yves dezalay and bryant g  garth  dealing in virtue   in contrast  the data show that the crucial transformative period actually took place between the 1950s and 1970s  when a relatively well defined group of individuals emerged as the leading arbitrators at the international chamber of commerce  these individuals the secant marginalssucceeded in constructing a cooperative interface  rather than competition  between otherwise separate legal systems and professions  in doing so  they created the conditions necessary for the emergence of a new transnational legal profession  at a more general level  the article proposes an alternative narrative of globalization  wherein actors operating at the intersection of various systems  create new arenas of governance on the basis of inter system cooperation  
 complexity in employment life courses in europe in the twentieth century large cross national differences but little change across birth cohorts whether employment life courses have become more unstable and complex across the twentieth century has been a prominent topic in academic and public debate  yet  empirical evidence on longer term employment trajectories and how they changed across cohorts beyond single country analyses is sparse  in this paper  we propose a new methodological approach that includes measures developed in sequence analysis to summarize complexity in employment trajectories in a cross classified multilevel model by cohort and country  this allows us to quantify and describe change in the complexity of employment trajectories across cohorts relative to variation across fourteen european countries  we use sharelife data to analyze employment trajectories from age 15 to 45 for men and women born between 1918 and 1963  for these birth cohorts  findings show that change across cohorts is negligibly small  compared with a sizeable variation of complexity in employment trajectories across countries  further  based on theoretical assumptions derived from the varieties of capitalism literature  we demonstrate that the cross national variation in employment complexity can  in part  be accounted for by employment protection legislation and unemployment protection measured as wage replacement rates  we conclude that in accordance with other studies  our findings contradict the commonly held belief that employment trajectories have become much more unstable across the second half of the twentieth century  more generally  the proposed methodological approach is also promising to analyze complexity in life course trajectories in other areas of application  
 compliance or negotiation  diyanet s female preachers and the diffusion of a  true  religion in turkey this article addresses the religious activities of the female preachers  vaizeler  employed by the turkish presidency of religious affairs  diyanet   it investigates the extent to which  and how  the activities carried out by the diyanet s vaizeler are in compliance with a state attempt to standardise and control female religious engagement  as religious officers  the vaizeler both spread and embody an organised religion  however  far from any dichotomous perspective  to assert their religious authority the diyanet s preachers navigate daily between compliance with the institution s dogmas and negotiation with a plurality of interpretations labelled as unofficial  popular and traditional  to fully assess this issue  this article refers to ethnographic observations of everyday vaizeler s preaching activities in istanbul s mosques  conducted between 2013 and 2014  these observations are crucial for contextualising the evolution of the turkish state monopoly over religious affairs  particularly in the aftermath of the july 2016 attempted coup  
 compliant  cynical  or critical  chinese youth s explanations of social problems and individual civic responsibility this article explores how school aged chinese youth make meaning of the civic roles of citizens in the context of a society with a powerful one party government  we examined how 16 focus groups  n   64  of adolescents from urban and rural schools in shanghai and nantong talked about the causes and solutions of social problems facing china  our analysis revealed a broad range of explanations of social problems  framed by contrasting narratives about the power relationship between the government and citizens  we explore how two narratives  categorized as cynical and compliant  dominated the group discussions in urban and rural schools  respectively  and how a third narrative  categorized as critical  also emerged  
 conceptualizing the spectrum of the bereavement discourse this article presents the spectrum of the bereavement discourse  namely  how various social groups interpret the loss of their children s lives or the potential risk to their lives posed by their military service and translate it into public discourse  as a spectrum of attitudes  it is argued that this spectrum ranges from subversive to submissive approaches  furthermore  within the confines of the declining casualty tolerance  two variables cumulatively determine the actors  choice of discourse  the level of enforcement of recruitment  ranging from conscription to voluntary recruitment  and the social position of the group to which the agents belong  given that conscription brings powerful  high status groups into the ranks who may be unwilling to make sacrifices for war  subversive responses are more likely to occur in conscript militaries than in volunteer forces and vice versa  this article maps this spectrum and hypothesizes about its determinants  
 confined to care  girls  gendered vulnerabilities in secure institutions in denmark  secure care institutions are gender integrated and accommodate young people with a wide range of psychiatric and social troubles  the large majority of young people are placed here in surrogate custody  and a minority  mostly girls  are placed here in protective care  based on a qualitative study of gendered practices and experiences in danish secure care institutions  this article provides insight into how gender and pathology merge to produce vulnerabilities in care  the study finds that while girls are viewed through a lens of pathology  secure care practices largely fail to provide treatment for girls  drawing on feminist scholarship on penal welfare responses to women  i argue that institutional practices contribute to the production of disordered selves and the marginalization of girls in secure care  this demonstrates how welfare provision for the most marginalized girls reproduces and reinforces the inequalities that brought them into secure care  the study hereby supplements an emerging scholarship on how gender underpins penal welfare responses and interventions  
 conflict imagery in a connective environment  audiovisual content on twitter following the 2015 2016 terror attacks in paris and brussels acute crisis events ranging from natural disasters to terrorist incidents now tend to generate an almost immediate response from social media users  this is especially pronounced on twitter  due to that platform s specific affordances as a particularly open and real time medium  while analyses of such events have increased over recent years  we still understand relatively little about the way in which audiovisual materials relating to such crises are circulated and what they contribute to processes of witnessing  this is important  however  in an increasingly visual age when audiovisual material tends to be more widely viewed and shared than plain text updates  and thus has a greater potential to influence viewers  interpretations of an event  to address this gap in our understanding  this article investigates the distribution dynamics of audiovisual content on twitter in the immediate aftermath of terror attacks in paris and brussels  results point to the importance of broadening conceptualisations of conflict related visuals and the ongoing relevance of affective content in such material  furthermore  this article argues that contexts of time and space are crucial to consider  as is the role that individual actors   both human and non human   play in disseminating such content  
 connection between alcohol consumption and aggression in a population of romanian students nowadays there is global concern regarding the connection between alcohol consumption and aggressive behavior among young individuals  the aim of the present study is to examine if there is a direct link between increased alcohol intake and increased aggression among romanian students  on a sample comprised of 772 romanian students  were measured socio demographic and economic data  information about family environment  assessment of health risk behavior and the level of aggression using buss perry aggression questionnaire  bpaq   the chi square test  chi 2    goodman and kruskal s gamma test  and multinomial logistic regression were used for statistical analysis  which led to proving the existence of a direct association between aggression and patterns and frequency of drinking  patterns of drinking are significantly influenced by gender  smoking  time spent in clubs and restaurants  and physical abuse by parents during childhood  alcohol abuse represents a factor more specific to men  influenced by low parental control and domestic violence  social cultural life led to benefits over level of aggressive behavior  for population of the romanian students analyzed  the alcohol intake and level of aggression are directly connected  
 consequences of partner incarceration for women s employment research has documented the limited opportunities men have to earn income while in prison and the barriers to securing employment and decent wages upon release  however  little research has considered the relationship between men s incarceration and the employment of the women in their lives  economic theory suggests that family members of incarcerated individuals may attempt to smooth income fluctuation resulting from incarceration by increasing their labor supply  this study used data from the fragile families and child wellbeing study  n 3 780  to investigate how men s incarceration is associated with the number of hours their female partners work as well as variation in this association  results showed that  on average  women s hours of work were not significantly impacted by the incarceration of their partners  however  there was a positive relationship between partner incarceration and employment among more advantaged groups of women  e g   married women  white women   
 considerations on the role of palliative care in the mourning period death is a universal and inevitable phenomenon  with strong emotional loading for both the dying and those around them  family members or caregivers  of a medical or psychosocial  spiritual nature   the main response to the passing of someone dear is grief  which is usually reversible  however  in some cases  it may generate important general morbidity and mortality risks  palliative care represents a complex approach meant to improve the quality of life of terminal patients and of their family members  by preventing and mitigating physical pain  as well as psychosocial and spiritual issues  in this field  responsibility toward the patient extends to his  her family after the patient s death  in this paper  the authors analyze the sources of mourning labour  as well as the intervention means suitable for the genuine existential crisis entailed by the passing of a loved one  the importance of the theme resides in the fine line between physiological grief and depression  with all the risks it involves  and in the need of identifying ways to familiarize the family with the idea of death  both before the passing of the dying and afterwards  to facilitate the mourning labour of those left behind and to avoid its complications   
 considering alternate sources of role identity  childless parents and their animal  kids  identity theory posits that role identity is negotiated between human social actors and is based in broader cultural expectations about how particular statuses should be performed  i argue that the formation of role identity in actors can also occur in relationship to nonhuman actors  if they are perceived as minded  depending on context and human perception  identity can be formed as a result of interaction and developing  theory of mind  with nonhuman animals  directly implicating the animal  using in depth interviews of childless and childfree companion animal owners  i demonstrate the existence of a parent identity in childless participants that would not otherwise be present were it not for interaction with the animal  child   this identity is confirmed in participant narratives describing substantial behavioral output aligned with the u s  cultural ideal of  parent   likewise  i find that significant others provide external support for the enactment of this role identity  allowing participants to verify self in situation  overall  my analysis emphasizes the importance of considering nonhuman sources as occupying counterstatus positions in the formation of role identity while highlighting how these relationships affect interaction in the childfree and childless home  thus expanding scholarly understanding about both identity formation and emerging family types  
 constituting co ethnic exploitation  the economic and cultural meanings of cash in hand jobs for ethnic chinese migrants in australia this article asks two questions  for immigrants  how is an exploitative labor market constituted  and how do immigrant employees and employers understand exploitation involving co ethnics  taking ethnic chinese immigrants  prc chinese  taiwanese  hong kongese  as an example  this article examines employer hiring strategies  employee economic rationales  cultural perceptions  and the work experiences of ethnic chinese migrant workers who find work in the informal sector in australia  this article argues that language barriers  relatively higher earnings than home countries  the flexibility of cash in hand jobs  and the low expectation that job seekers have of co ethnic employers increase the willingness of ethnic chinese migrants to work in the cash economy  on the other hand  employers look for an obedient  employee and create the image of a  good boss  to decrease the expression of hostile emotions from their employees  considering how economic factors and mutual cultural perceptions are embedded and reflected in the informal labor market  this article concludes that co ethnic exploitation is formulated and justified by both employers and employees in australia

 constructing a sense of commitment in  living apart together   lat  relationships  interpretive agency and individualization lat  living apart together  relationships involve two people in a long term intimate relationship who choose to live in separate households  due to their tendency to lack structural commitments and rely on emotional bonds  lat relationships can be viewed as a manifestation of individualization  despite the increasing social acceptability of non traditional partnerships  in many ways lat relationships are still seen as deviant  and lacking commitment  by outsiders  this article draws on interpretive analyses of interviews with 28 lat couples in two canadian cities to explore how participants exercise agency and construct a sense of commitment in their relationships under these conditions  e g  responding to generalized and particular others   in general  the lat couples in this study described their commitments as strong  and as rooted in sexual fidelity  mutual exchanges of support  affection  with a long term orientation  a willingness to work through difficulties and a shared history  some ambivalence in discussing commitment can be explained with reference to participants  strong desire to maintain independence within the relationship  this study represents one of the first in depth examinations of lat relationships undertaken in canada  
 constructing  confirming  and contesting icons  the alan kurdi imagery appropriated by  humanitywashedashore  ai weiwei  and charlie hebdo this article argues that appropriations are central to the production and reception of visual icons  appropriations are instrumental in iconization processes as they confirm and consolidate the iconic status by recycling the image in question  moreover  appropriations are vital to their reception as they help shape and delimit the publics and discourses surrounding visual icons  this article draws on existing research on icons and appropriations to develop a theoretical framework for how appropriations construct  confirm  and contest icons and how personification constitutes the main link between icons and their appropriations  three sets of appropriations are analyzed of the iconic imagery of alan kurdi  the refugee boy drowning in the mediterranean sea in 2015  first  the numerous appropriations circulated under the twitter hashtag  humanitywashedashore  based on genre analysis of these appropriations  two overall modes are singled out  the appropriations decontextualize or recontextualize the figure of kurdi  the two next analytical cases test the limits of decontextualization and recontextualization  chinese artist ai weiwei decontextualizes the kurdi imagery in a controversial reenactment  while a series of cartoons by french satirical weekly charlie hebdo inserted the photo into contested contexts to critique why and how this imagery was turned into an icon  
 construction and management of stigma based on a voluntary achieved status previous research on stigma has focused on ascribed personal attributes that are either impossible or difficult to change  less is known  however  about how people voluntarily join stigmatized groups and manage stigma based on an achieved status  this paper sought to answer this question by focusing on stigma management strategies used by a humans vs  zombies  hvz  gaming organization in a southeastern university  data were collected through four months of fieldwork and twelve interviews with hvz gamers and moderators  results showed that gamers  decision to join the group reflected their effort to strengthen a sense of moral worth  furthermore  in order to keep receiving this benefit and minimize potential costs  they used three strategies to manage their stigma based on the voluntary  achieved status   1  by othering stereotypical members   2  by challenging the stereotype  and  3  by reappropriating the stigma  as they employed these strategies  gamers drew on social discourses available in the organizational and life course context  
 construction and validation of the moral inclusion exclusion of other groups  mieg  scale moral exclusion is defined as viewing others as lying beyond the boundary within which moral values and rules of justice apply  in contrast  the process of moral inclusion involves the extension of social justice to several social groups  thus  both moral inclusion and exclusion are a pivotal dimension in the study of social inequalities  although the concept of moral inclusion exclusion has a history of more than 20 years  research still lacks accurate instruments for measuring it  in this article  a first version of a scale that measures moral inclusion exclusion was constructed and validated  the good reliability and correlation indexes found across the samples suggest that mieg is a good measure for tapping into moral exclusion inclusion symptoms  
 contested terrain and terrain that contests  donald trump  golf s environmental politics  and a challenge to anthropocentrism in physical cultural studies this article focuses on the case of trump international golf links  scotland  tigls   a golf course in aberdeenshire that opened in 2012 after a lengthy and contentious application and development phase  herein  we draw from a larger study of golf and the environment with the aim of assessing both the tigls case in itself and its implications for the study of sport physical culture in general  the tigls case on the one hand provides an empirical example of the concept of environmental managerialism    which is to say it exemplifies how governments  even with an ostensible commitment to sustainability in place  can still give approval to environmentally impactful development projects  it also provides an empirical example of a new social movement at work  once the tigls development earned government approval  it was met by opposition during the construction phase by a group called tripping up trump   on the other hand  we use the tigls case as a platform for a broader research commentary  one focused especially on the recently emergent physical cultural studies  pcs  literature  our contention at this time is that pcs as thus far conceived is anthropocentric in its scope  the important and necessary role that non humans play in physical cultural contexts has largely been overlooked  we call for further consideration of how new materialist  perspectives can inform research on sport and other dimensions of physical culture  
 contesting lifestyle risk and gendering coronary candidacy  lay epidemiology of heart disease in finland in the 1970s this study addresses two issues currently under critical discussion in the epidemiology of cardiovascular diseases  cvd   the relative neglect of women and the individualised nature of key risk factors  it focuses on the north karelia project  nkp   a community programme aimed at coronary heart disease  chd  prevention in a predominantly rural finnish region in the early 1970s  that is  during a period when the epidemiological understanding of cvd still was relatively new and actively promoted  adopting the notions of lay epidemiology and coronary candidacy  culturally mediated explanatory models lay people use to assess who is likely to develop heart disease and why  the study shows that locals targeted by the project critically engaged with both of these bias  based on the rich materials resulting from project activities the study shows  first  how many locals subsumed the individualised and lifestyle based approach to chd prevention promoted by nkp under a more general framework emphasising the health effects of ongoing structural changes in the area  and second  how women constructed themselves as viable coronary candidates  the case supports the position in the current discussions on lay expertise that wants to integrate lay experiences more firmly into epidemiological studies and public health  
 context  orders of worth  and the justification of meat consumption practices although animal welfare is felt to be important by consumers  behavioural patterns do not fully reflect this  rather than relating this attitude behaviour gap to hypocrisy  this article  building on pragmatic sociological theory and an empirical study  focuses on context dependent moral evaluations  an analysis of focus group interviews conducted in three countries shows that meat related consumption practices involve several competing sets of moral conventions  and the results demonstrate that public concerns about animal welfare vary depending on whether they relate to an everyday or production context  in the former  animal welfare does not play a big role  and given this it can be argued that people are not hypocritical  since the practices and perceptions are actually united within the given context  it is concluded that the lack of civic justifications in the context of everyday life calls for new ways of making animal welfare relevant in this context in order to support consumers in moving towards products with high standards of animal welfare  
 contingent maternities  maternal claims making in third party reproduction the new reproductive technologies have significantly impacted definitions of motherhood  historically  mothers were defined through the act of giving birth  but egg donation  embryo donation  and surrogacy disrupt this  now multiple women can potentially claim maternity through gestational  genetic  legal  and social ties  although there is some legal precedent for designating parentage  there is no simple solution to identify the true  mother  i address maternal claims making in third party reproduction via a content analysis of us patient literature for infertile women  major tensions arise over which link to privilege  especially regarding genetic versus gestational ties in egg donation versus surrogacy  however  adding embryo donation to the analysis illuminates another crucial dimension previously overlooked   that heterosexual women s maternal claims are supported by their partner s paternity claims  ultimately  i argue that although reproductive organisational discourse carefully constructs credible options for maternal claims making  contemporary reproductive medicine does not define maternity through assisted reproduction as a truly autonomous connection  rather  maternity is highly contingent and thus potentially discreditable  
 contract care in dentistry  sense making of the concept and in practice when multiple institutional logics are at play in 2009 contract dental care was introduced into sweden s public dental service under a programme called dental care for health  dch   previous research has revealed a possible dilemma whereby dental care professionals had the role of insurance agent foisted upon them  as they were assigned the task of selling contracts   using qualitative interviews  this study explores how these professionals make sense of contract dental care today  drawing on the concepts of occupational and organisational professionalism  in combination with the institutional logics perspective  we discern that dental care professionals are entangled in multiple rationalities when reasoning about and dealing with dch  a professional logic comes into play over health issues and preventive care  while market and corporate logics are present in relation to selling contracts and taking responsibility for the financial aspects of dch  all of which creates tensions in these professionals  overall  dental care professionals in the welfare sector respond both to an organisational and an occupational professionalism  
 contradictions  consequences and the human toll of food safety culture in an intensifying climate of scrutiny over food safety  the food industry is turning to  food safety culture  as a one size fits all solution to protect both consumers and companies  this strategy focuses on changing employee behavior from farm to fork to fit a universal model of bureaucratic control  the goal is system wide cultural transformation in the name of combatting foodborne illness  through grounded fieldwork centered on the case of a regional wholesale produce market in california  we examine the consequences of this bureaucratization of food safety power on the everyday routines and lived experiences of people working to grow  pack  and deliver fresh produce  we find that despite rhetoric promising a rational and universal answer to food safety  fear and frustration over pervasive uncertainty and legal threats can produce cynicism  distrust  and fragmentation among agrifood actors  furthermore  under the cover of its public health mission to prevent foodborne illness  food safety culture exerts a new moral economy that sorts companies and employees into categories of  good  and  bad  according to an abstracted calculation of  riskiness  along a scale from safe to dangerous  we raise the concern that  safety  is usurping other deeply held values and excluding cultural forms and experiential knowledges associated with long standing food ways  the long term danger  we conclude  is that this uniform and myopic response to real risks of foodborne illness will not lead to a holistically healthy or sustainable agrifood system  but rather perpetuate a spiraling cycle of crisis and reform that carries a very real human toll  
 controlling the flow  how urban music videos allow creative scope and permit social restriction as a key genre within the urban music economy  grime music has a national and global presence  in the youtube era  young people film music videos and broadcast them online  legislation and policies ostensibly created as a means to maintain public safety combine to create methods to control the behaviour of young people  the production and circulation of urban music videos  therefore  become a contested activity  the racial mechanics of this gaze mean that for urban black youth  group endeavours are often criminalized as gang activity   drawing on a 2014 twitter profile as its starting point  this article examines the application of public safety legislation and policies in an east london borough  it reflects on how a disciplinary process  allows for local authorities  the metropolitan police and the judiciary to pin down and organize the movements of urban music practitioners in specific and particular ways

 cooperative membership and community engagement  findings from a latin american survey cooperatives as organization have mainly been explored in the field of business and management due to their operation in the business sector  and studies of nonprofit organizations have given little attention to them  consequently  cooperatives studies have tended to examine economic outcomes  such as productivity and job security  comparing them to conventional business firms  nevertheless  cooperatives are membership associations and have organizational characteristics in common with other types of voluntary associations  furthermore  one explicit organizational principle of cooperatives is concern for community  and their contributions to the community have been covered frequently by media  therefore  it is imperative to examine cooperative members  community engagement  and compare it to other types of association members  using a national sample of venezuelans  the relationships between association memberships and community involvement were compared across different types of associations  the results showed that cooperative members had a higher likelihood of being involved in community matters than those from other types of associations  although the venezuelan cooperatives have received vast support from the chavez government for community development  this result can have an implication on the cooperatives  organizational identity as those who provide members with resources necessary for civic engagement beyond the organizations  
 coping with dilemma  how german sport media users respond to sport mega events in autocratic countries in recent years  sport mega events have been frequently awarded to autocratic countries whose regimes violate democratic values and human rights  based on the theory of cognitive dissonance  we assume that this is a potential source of internal conflict for viewers  especially for sports enthusiasts and politically aware recipients  special attention rests on the consequences of the recipients  strategies of addressing this predicament for important stakeholders of these events  namely the reporting media  the host country and sponsors  we conducted an online survey among 711 german respondents to examine how recipients cope with this dilemma using the forthcoming fifa soccer world cup 2018 in russia as an example  our results show that while recipients are strongly interested in soccer and politics  most of them do not necessarily perceive these two spheres as inextricably connected  their awareness of sociopolitical issues in the context of sport eventsand thus the decisive factor to explain cognitive dissonanceis arguably low  still  when recipients experience cognitive dissonance they rely on certain strategies to reduce or avoid dissonance  they do not elude this dilemma by preferring sports broadcasting without coverage of the event s negative circumstances  but are actually willing to pass on parts of the tournament  they also do not denigrate the credibility of the media or emphasize positive aspects of the host country russia  in fact  the recipients would prefer if the world cup had not been awarded to russia in the first place  however  respondents experiencing cognitive dissonance are also more likely to engage in political consumerism  by deliberately deciding against or in favor of products and sponsors depending on whether or not those are associated with the event  
 corruption is bad news for a free press  reassessing the relationship between media freedom and corruption objective  in the following analysis  we investigate the determinants of government efforts to censor media  we develop and test a new theory that argues executive level corruption influences when governments are more likely to attempt media censorship  after modeling the media government dynamic in game form  we utilize the new varieties of democracy  v dem  dataset to empirically test this relationship on both traditional media  print and broadcast  and new media  internet   using panel  ordinary least squares  ols  regression with a lagged dependent variable and country fixed effects  we examine the relationship from 1960 to 2015 for traditional media and from 1993 to 2015 for new media  the results suggest that as governments become more corrupt  governmental efforts to censor both forms of media are likely to increase  we further examine the relationship among different world regions and regime types  we find overall confirmation of our hypothesis  
 courting custom  regulating access to justice in rural south africa and malawi the continued relevance of customary law for the regulation of the daily lives of africa s citizens poses serious governance challenges to sovereign states  such as how best to regulate customary dispute settlement  while confronted with largely similar problems  the south african government proposed to enhance and regulate the position of its traditional courts  whereas malawi has opted for the creation of hybrid local courts that combine characteristics of regular state courts and customary fora to be the main avenue of customary law cases  this paper analyzes the strengths and weaknesses of both approaches and displays how the two countries  historical and political contexts enable and constrain their regulatory choices in the field of customary dispute settlement  as well as influence the risk and benefits of the various options  in this respect  the political power of the traditional leaders is a significant determinant  
 creating value  consuming bologna  the case of degustibo this article addresses the aestheticization of traditional foods and the use of territorialization as a brand value for the promotion of products and services  economy of quality is studied through a focus on the role that political institutions may have in promoting quality chains  through document analysis  questionnaires  interviews  and focus groups  we consider the case of the quality brand  degustibo  promoted by the province of bologna  italy  this initiative was developed to help local shops and restaurants find a source of common identity in the local territory  we consider actors  narratives in defining  judging  and creating quality as related to the specific branding initiative  focusing on the way different descriptions of quality as related to ways of enacting territory are read and presented as performing authenticity  we explore how branding has been supported  realized  and responded to  concentrating on the encounter between consumers and producers  a focus on producers  perceptions of consumer competence helps addressing the narrative asymmetry between consumers and producers  and the ways in which consumer rituals work as sites of knowledge transmission and conflict  defining the contours of an arena for the performance of concerted and contested notions such as traditional  local  and authentic food  
 crime and punishment in ancient china and its relevance today the legal system of a nation and its response to crime reflect the economic  political  and cultural conditions prevailing at the time  as well as popular values and customs  in the case of china  the oldest continuous civilization in the world  the criminal justice system contains ancient traditions that are still influential  the cosmological tradition  which has the longest history  treated nature as the victim when human actions violated social norms  thus  harsh punishments were imposed that rigidly mimicked violent aspects of nature  if the victim died  even by accident  someone must die to balance the harm caused to nature  the confucian tradition developed a competing natural philosophy that tempered punishment by restoring social and natural order through moral education about proper behavior  confucianism was designed to maintain civility in the absence of central authority by persuading leaders to create a harmonious society based on the limited use of raw power and punishment  finally  the legalist tradition restored harsh punishment as a way to impose order upon a fragmented society in which local despots had been carrying out arbitrary judgments  but legalism carried the seeds of its own destruction and required confucianism to balance it in creating a durable system of governance and justice  each tradition developed as a way of solving a specific set of social and political problems  and each persisted as a partial solution to perennial questions about how to deal with social disorder  even though criminal justice in china was westernized after 1911  the older traditions still have an influence  socialism has modified traditions of crime and punishment to some extent  but the overriding concern for social order and the ability of the state to guide society has not diminished  
 criminal collaboration and risk  the drivers of al qaeda s network structure before and after 9 11 a group s resilience is often linked to its network structure  while decentralized network properties have been associated with resilience at the group level  little is known about the individual level factors that lead groups to adopt these structures  criminal groups  consistently faced with unexpected external disruptions  provide an opportunity to examine individual decisions to collaborate across periods of increased risk  using data on 118 terrorist offenders across six attacks we test whether individual decisions to collaborate are influenced by variation in law enforcement activity  results from exponential random graph models demonstrate that many of the processes that drive collaboration between offenders differ when faced with greater risk  connectivity was maximized in periods of decreased enforcement activity  with offenders more likely to collaborate in dense  local triads  following an increase in interdictions  triad closure had no impact on co offending   c  2017 elsevier b v  all rights reserved  
 criteria for quality in qualitative research and use of freedom of information requests in the social sciences access to information  ati  and freedom of information  foi  requests are an under used means of producing data in the social sciences  especially across canada and the united states  we use literature on criteria for quality in qualitative inquiry to enhance ongoing debates and developments in ati foi research  and to extend literature on quality in qualitative inquiry  we do this by building on tracy s  2010  article on criteria for quality in qualitative inquiry  which advances meaningful terms of reference for qualitative researchers to use in improving the quality of their work  and illustrating these criteria using examples of ati foi research from our own work and from others  in canada  the united states  and the united kingdom  we argue that  when systematically designed and conducted  ati foi research can prove extraordinary in all eight of tracy s criteria  
 cross national variations in the security gap  perceived job insecurity among temporary and permanent employees and employment protection legislation it is often shown that temporary employees generally perceive their job insecurity to be higher than permanent employees  however  substantial variations in this perceived job security gap exist between countries  this article engages with this knowledge and adds to it by focusing on these country variations and asking what role the strength of employment protection legislation  epl  has both on the size of the job security gap and in explaining country differences  the developed hypotheses suggest that the two components of epl job security provisions  indicating the  protection gap  between permanent and temporary employees as well as specific regulations on the use of temporary contracts will increase the job security gap  these hypotheses are tested using data from the european social survey for 2004 and 2010 and data on employment regulations from the organisation for economic co operation and development  compared to existing studies  this article offers a more detailed look at the operationalization of job security provisions and regulations on temporary employment proposing an alternative measurement which is more closely related to the theoretical arguments  by using this more elaborate operationalization  the multilevel model shows that the gap in perceived job security between temporary and permanent employees systematically increases with respect to the two components of epl  
 crossing borders and criminalizing identity  the disintegrated subjects of administrative sanctions this paper draws on in depth  qualitative interviews that examine individual experiences in two different legal contexts  deportation regimes and supermax prisons  through putting these contexts and experiences into dialogue  we identify common legal processes of punishment experiences across both contexts  specifically  the u s  legal system re labels immigrants  as deportable noncitizens  and supermax prisoners  as dangerous gang offenders   this re labeling begins a process of othering  which ends in categorical exclusions for both immigrants and supermax prisoners  as individuals experience this categorical exclusion  they cross multiple borders and boundariesoften against their willmoving from prison to detention center to other countries beyond the u s  border  and from isolation to prison to free society  in both cases  the state action that subjects experience as punishment is civil and  therefore  nominally not punitive  ultimately  excluded individuals find themselves in a space of legal nonexistence  by examining these common processes and experiences  we argue that a new kind of subject is revealed  a disintegrating subject  as opposed to a juridical or disciplinary subject  whose exclusion reinforces the power of the state  
 crossing borders to buy sex  taiwanese men negotiating gender  class and nationality in the chinese sex industry as a rising economic power in east asia  taiwan once served as a destination of sex tourism  now gradually it is becoming a country of buyers seeking sex abroad  currently  china appears to be one of the most popular destinations  drawing on data from in depth interviews with 40 taiwanese male sex buyers and ethnographic data collected by traveling with a group of five men  this article aims to explore how buying sex abroad appears to be the complicated site of power struggles where sexuality intersects with gender  nationality  and global economic hierarchy  by conceptualizing men s buying of sex abroad as sexual migration  i illustrate the ways in which men s border crossings for buying sex are complexly embedded in the gender  sexuality  and class relations in taiwan  and how their sexual encounters with chinese women are always contaminated by the politics of nationalism which derive from the unsettled political atmospheres across the taiwan strait  i argue that sexual migration is made attractive mainly because of the sexual discontent caused by the stratification of the taiwanese sex industry and the sexual constraints and routineness of heterosexual monogamy  buying sex abroad therefore appears as a temporary escape from this mundaneness and banality  conceptualizing men s buying sex abroad in dynamic transnational contexts  we could illustrate how men actively negotiate sexual desires at both ends of the taiwan strait  and go further to analyse how sexuality serves to shape regional migration  and how it interweaves with gender  class and nationality  
 crowd patronage intermediaries  geographies and relationships in patronage networks this article introduces a new mode of patronage of the arts  crowd patronage  in so doing the article illustrates the plural roles of intermediaries in patronage networks which go beyond bourdieuian cultural intermediaries to include regulatory and financial actors  a brief history of patronage is presented which outlines different modes and eras of patronage for the arts since the 12th century  particular attention is paid to the geographies of patronage networks  the mobility of artists  the plurality of roles played by intermediaries and the relations between patrons and artists  these themes then structure the analysis of crowd patronage through a case study of the patronage platform patreon in the remainder of the paper  crowd patronage is distinctive because of the scale and geographical scope of patronage networks  its focus on funding practice rather than outputs  a shift in the power relationships between patron and artist  and processes of re intermediation  
 csa shareholder food lifestyle behaviors  a comparison across consumer groups community supported agriculture  csa  programs are transforming the way people relate to food and agriculture  many researchers have considered the transformative potential of csas on economic  social  and environmental relations  they illustrate how participants are embedded in broader political economic transformations  the same focus  however  has not been given to csas  transformative impact on individual shareholders especially in terms of their relationship to food and health  we draw together literatures from behavioral economics  econometrics  and political ecology to evaluate the potential impacts of csa participation on food lifestyle behaviors  using primary data drawn from a survey of four groups with distinct food acquisition environments  we compare respondents  self assessed food related behaviors along three different categories   1  produce versus processed food consumption   2  food away from home consumption  and  3  food acquisition and interest in nutrition  by documenting between group differences  we confirm that shareholders display significant absolute differences to other groups along numerous indicators related to the above stated categories and in general assessments of health  these differences correspond directionally to behaviors public health officials identify as correlated to beneficial health outcomes  we conclude by theorizing how the food environments delineated by a csa exchange relationship provide unique reflexive opportunities for participants to develop diverse food related skills and behaviors  
 cultivating consent  nonstate leaders and the orchestration of state legibility in recent decades  the sociology of the state has become engrossed in the relationship between knowledge and modern statecraft  heeding recent calls for society centered approaches  this article investigates the role of nonstate leaders in the production of state knowledge  it takes up the following question  how have nonstate leaders  i e   civil leaders and community advocates  contributed to what james scott has termed state legibility  while historical traces suggest that these actors have worked to lessen opposition to state projects  this activity remains empirically understudied and conceptually underdeveloped  addressed to this problem  this article introduces the concept of consent building and proposes an analytic approach that focuses on the motivations of nonstate leaders  the obstacles of noncompliance they confront  and the persuasive tactics used to foster public cooperation  to illustrate the purchase of this approach  it presents a case study of local latino promoters of the 2010 u s  census  this analysis reveals how nonstate leaders can enable  rather than impede  the capacity to see like a state  
 cultivating support for punitive criminal justice policies  news sectors and the moderating effects of audience characteristics this study investigates whether exposure to various news sectors  local television  network television  cable television  radio  daily print newspapers  and internet  is associated with audience members  criminal justice policy preferences  and how these relationships are moderated by audience members  socio demographic characteristics  i propose that the relationship between news exposure and punitiveness is mediated by audience members  instrumental concerns  fear of crime and previous victimization  and expressive concerns  belief in the importance of traditional ties  feelings of racial resentment  and pessimism about the national economy   i further suggest that the relationship between news exposure and punitiveness is moderated by audience members  socio demographic characteristics  race ethnicity  local crime rate  and political ideology   finally  i contend that individual news sectors vary in their attention to crime and their rhetorical framing  and thus have differing relationships with punitiveness  results of a nationally representative survey suggest that news exposure cultivates punitiveness among whites  but not among blacks or hispanics  among whites  local news viewership has a significant positive relationship with punitiveness  particularly among individuals living in low crime areas  cable television  radio  print newspaper  and internet news exposure have significant relationships with punitiveness  the direction of which hinges on audience members  partisanship  i discuss the results in the context of the social construction of reality  highlighting the interplay between experienced and vicarious sources of knowledge  and in terms of selective exposure  emphasizing that audience members  news outlet choices have profound implications for their worldviews  
 cultural and academic adjustment of refugee youth  introduction to the special issue in this introduction to the ijir special issue on refugee youth in academic settings  the editors sought manuscripts that examined both challenges and effective practices in countries of temporary and permanent refugee resettlement  we welcomed diverse methodological approaches and empirical work at all levels and types of education  formal  non formal  and informal   our final selections do not fully represent the field of refugee education  as eight of the nine are studies in third countries of permanent resettlement  a designation received by only about one percent of the total refugee population  perspectives came from the social sciences  psychology  sociology  anthropology  and sociolinguistic disciples  themes of the articles fall into two broad categories  1  educational challenges due to trauma  acculturation stressors  and educational issues  and 2  educational practices intended to address some of these challenges  although the resettlement category is the smallest of the unhcr s  durable solutions   the authors present important findings to support refugee students  success  these have to do with collaborative processes  issues of identity  the use of social media  and teacher training in multicultural and language support  in considering future work in this field  we conclude that dimensions of justice need to be more fully examined in other refugee solutions  such as repatriation and local integration in the first country of refuge   we recommend that more research be conducted on the current european  migrant crisis   we also call for scholars to be public intellectuals in venues that can reframe the characterization of refugees in opposition to  fake news  fanning public fears  
 cultural consumption through the epistemologies of the south   humanization  in transnational football fan solidarities in 2014  boaventura de sousa santos awoke the global sociological community to the need to privilege humanization  in the exploration of transnational solidarities  this article presents the cultural consumption of a football club   liverpool fc   to understand the common love   suffering   care  and knowledge  that fans who are part of the brazil reds  or switzerland reds   although not all fans engaged in such communities are from  brazil or switzerland  experience  the argument is that the global north lexicon of social class  ethnicity  gender and  especially  nationality is less significant as starting points for analysis than humanization through shared love  which consolidates liverpool fc fans  transnational solidarities  accordingly  the article calls for the epistemologies of the global south to be used to understand the practices of cultural consumption that constitute activities in the sphere of everyday life  such as those involved in love  for a football club  
 cultural omnivorousness in turkey recent cultural consumption research has drawn attention to the emergence of the high status cultural omnivore   that is  individuals who consume a wide range of cultural products  including the expected high culture   but more popular  forms as well  initially reported in studies conducted in the developed west  this study broadens the basis of comparison by investigating the case of turkey   a non western  predominantly muslim  developing country with a long history of state led westernization  using data from a nationally representative survey of adults  the study examines 34 cultural tastes in three domains   music  food  and literature   and participation in five different cultural activities for evidence of an omnivorous pattern  the items used include indicators of high  and popular  culture  as well as local  and global western  culture  the results of a latent class analysis clearly identify an omnivorous group  a distinctive feature of the turkish cultural field is that groups are largely defined by their orientation towards local versus global forms  with omnivores consuming both  in contrast to groups that restrict their diet to local  forms  further analysis shows that  similar to studies in other contexts  turkish omnivorousness is associated with higher social position  especially education and income  omnivores also tend to be younger and more secular in their views towards the role of religion in the public sphere  the article concludes that  in addition to the high popular distinction  the local global is a critical symbolic boundary shaping cultural identities in turkey  
 culture in acculturation  refugee youth s schooling experiences in international schools in new york city as the number of refugee children and youth across the world continues to grow at an alarming rate  the needs of refugee populations require more and sustained attention  this qualitative study explores the specific academic and socio emotional needs of refugee students in new york city  nyc   a city that has received refugees and asylum seekers from over 50 countries  using qualitative research methods and drawing on the literature on refugee students  school experiences and acculturation theory  in this article we ask how refugee students describe the key features of international high schools that foster students  academic success  social and cultural integration  and academic well being  moreover  we examine how the notion of culture itself can interfere with these efforts  
 custodial citizenship in the omnibus autism proceeding in contemporary processes of citizenship  parents and other caregivers often must make claims to the state on behalf of children with disabilities  in this article  we draw from data on the omnibus autism proceedings  oap   which were a series of hearings in 2007 and 2008 in which parents of children with autism attempted to receive compensation from a federal program for vaccine injury  during these hearings  parents and their attorneys obfuscated the children s subjectivity and instead showcased the children s physical suffering in order to claim that their children had suffered a legitimate injury from vaccines that warranted compensation  we develop the concept of custodial citizenship to account for the process by which a legible rights bearing subject appropriates the bodily suffering of the injured party in order to gain citizenship rights on behalf of that individual  in doing so  we trace the slippages of harm that occur in the lived experience of disability among family members and caregivers  in contrast to the individualizing rights granting framework of the court system  
 customer preferences and opaque intermediaries using two choice based experiments  we evaluate consumer preferences hotel attributes for firms selling hotel rooms across three online distribution channel formats  full information  semi opaque  and opaque online travel agents  a multinomial logit model is used to analyze the experimental data and measure consumer trade offs between price and other product attributes  we then use these preferences to determine optimal channel selling strategies  our optimal channel strategies illustrate under what conditions firms should add opaque distribution channels and the resulting incremental revenue obtained with the setting of optimal channel specific prices  we deploy two choice based experiments  traditional and menu based  in an effort to add flexibility to survey respondents in choice selection  as part of our analysis  we compare managerial insights from analysis based on traditional choice based experiments to that using menu based choice experiments  in general  we indicate that both forms of opaque selling increase firm demand and that with appropriate pricing can also increase firm revenue  in addition  opaque channels have elevated price sensitivity and increased impact of guest reviews versus traditional online travel agents  
 cut to the quick  the consequences of youth violent victimization for the timing of dating debut and first union formation concentrated in adolescence  violent victimization is developmentally disruptive  it undermines physical  mental  and socioemotional well being and compromises youths  transitions into and progression through key life course tasks  youth violent victimization  yvv  has been linked to precocious exits from adolescence and premature entries into adulthood  this includes early entry into coresidential romantic unions  which is but one stage of a relationship sequence generally beginning via dating debut  using data from the national longitudinal study of adolescent to adult health  add health  and cox regression  we examine the effects of yvv on the timing of dating debut and progression to first coresidential unions during adolescence and the transition to adulthood  we pay particular attention to how these effects may be structured by age and gender  overall  we find that victims begin dating sooner and progress more quickly from dating to first unions than do non victims  however  youths victimized in early adolescence withdraw from dating and union formation  whereas late adolescent victims appear to overinvest in relationships at least temporarily displaying accelerated entry into dating and rapid progression to first unions  we conclude by discussing the implication of these age graded patterns for intervention efforts and youth well being more broadly  
 cycling  subjects  in ongoing formation  the politics of interviews and interview analysis this article offers a poststructuralist analytic strategy that highlights the political nature of interview analysis  interviews pose a particular challenge for poststructuralist researchers given a widespread view that they are a method for accessing the truth   we develop a strategy that bypasses this difficulty by analysing precisely what is said  in interviews  in our analysis  discourse refers to knowledge  not language  with this understanding  we argue that focusing on exactly what is said  provides an entry point into the knowledges that make it possible for something to be said and into the eruption of new possibilities  this focus displaces assumptions about an interior  self who constructs versions of the world  with a concern for the strategic relations   the politics   within which objects and subject positions are produced  the paper draws on interviews conducted during a study into women cycling to demonstrate our poststructuralist analytic strategy  
 data analysis in mixed method research strategies for the integration of qualitative and quantitative data and results this article discusses data analysis in mixed methods approaches  the challenge of integration during the stage of analysis has recently become a main point of the discourse on mixed methods that for more than a decade had been centered on topics of research design and compatibility of paradigms  the article focuses on key aspects of integration strategies as well as on points of the integration  which depend largely on the research design of the project  ten different integration strategies in three areas are presented in detail  namely result based  data based and sequence oriented integration strategies  joint displays  which jointly present data and or results of the qualitative and the quantitative research strands a particularly important  
 de facto privatization and inequalities in educational opportunity in the transition to secondary school in rural malawi there has been a recent  rapid de facto privatization of education in many african countries  as the number of private secondary schools operating in the region has grown  the majority of these schools are  low cost  private schools where tuition and fees are set as low as possible to cover operating costs and still generate profit  proponents of low cost private schools argue that these schools have proliferated in impoverished areas to meet unmet demand for access to education and where private schools may offer better quality than locally available public schools  theories of inequality of educational opportunity suggest that if private schools offer better quality education  students from more advantaged families will be more likely to enroll at these institutions  potentially exacerbating educational inequality in the region  this analysis uses data from a school based longitudinal survey  the malawi schooling and adolescent study  to examine socio economic inequalities in the transition to secondary school and on time enrollment in upper secondary  my findings indicate that youth from non poor households are not only more likely to enroll in secondary school than poor youth  but they are also more likely to substitute enrollment in private schools for enrollment in second tier government schools  enrollment at private schools  however  does not yield schooling advantages  relative to both tiers of government secondary schooling  students who initially enrolled at private schools were the least likely to enroll on time in upper secondary school  these patterns suggest that these schooling circumstances may yield less segregation of opportunity than might otherwise be assumed  
 dea like efficiency ranking of regional health systems in spain the last decades have witnessed an increasing international concern in assessing how efficiently health care resources are used in producing health  at a country level  comparing the efficiency of regional health systems and ranking the regions accordingly promotes transparency policies and represents an important incentive for the design and implementation of specific programs aimed at improving the quality of health care services within the country  the use of data envelopment analysis  dea  as a tool for efficiency analysis in the health sector is well established  but its use with a ranking purpose is discouraged due to lack of discrimination and comparability issues  using data from the competent health authority in spain  the purpose of this study is to assess the efficiency of the regional health systems in spain and identify those regions that are using their health care inputs more efficiently than others  given the observed level of health outcomes  to this aim  a dea based model that operates under a common weights basis is used in order to improve discrimination and establish a common scale for a proper comparison of the regional health systems in spain that can be subsequently ranked by their efficiency score  
 deciphering the  ethnic penalty  of immigrants in western europe  a cross classified multilevel analysis while most previous research on immigrants  assimilation refers to the residual disadvantage that remains in empirical analyses of economic outcomes as a general  ethnic penalty   this current paper disentangles the  ethnic penalty  by dividing it into four components  individual characteristics  country characteristics  the social environment in host country  and the policy environment in host country  this study tests the effects of these four components on three economic outcomes  employment  labor force participation  and household income  data from the european social survey  the migrant integration policy index  the un  and the world bank are integrated here  findings show that the main reasons for immigrants  disadvantage in terms of labor force participation and household income are both origin and host country characteristics  while the effects of ethnic origins  social exclusion  and policies are weaker  however  ethnic origins and social exclusion actually play a central role in determining unemployment of immigrants  
 decision making in the self evolved collegiate court  wikipedia s arbitration committee and its implications for self governance and judiciary in cyberspace this article considers the extent to which non legal factors  nationality  activity experience  conflict avoidance  and time constraints  affect decision making within collegiate courts  through the study of the wikipedia s arbitration committee  that body is a self evolved collegiate court of the internet s fifth most popular website  whose judges  known as arbitrators  are volunteers  this study shows that the decision making process of this body seems mostly unaffected by the demographic factors studied and the acclimatization bias  some evidence of conflict avoidance is found  despite the professed equality of members of the committee  there is clear evidence that some are much more active  and thus  influential  than others  compared to most traditional court settings  in the volunteer collegiate court studied here  time constraints play a much more significant role than previously suggested in the literature  
 defending the european political order  visions of politics in response to the radical right this article theorizes the european level political response to the radical right by suggesting a focus on the conceptions of politics  society and of the european union itself that inform this response  analyses of the ways in which the political mainstream relates to such movements remain under theorized and often fall back on understandings of political action in narrow instrumental terms  instead  this article proposes an approach to this response which emphasizes the process through which shared understanding of the european political project surface  it engages with these issues by turning to ideas that emerged in relation to the rise of european fascism in the 1930s on how to mount an effective defence of democracy  the underlying social analysis that fed into such strategies  the article argues  serves as a useful framework for analysis of the contemporary european response to the radical right

 democracy  protest and public sphere in russia after the 2011 2012 anti government protests  digital media at stake the 2011 2012 russian protest mobilisations were largely enabled by the rise of social networks  social and technological advancements paired to pave the way for the biggest protests since the fall of ussr   ubiquitous and uncensored social media facilitated the networking and mobilisation for this protest activity  liberal masses were able to share and discuss their grievances  unite and coordinate online for the offline protest  the digitally savvy protest public developed to confront the government  which appeared to be astonished by the scale of protest  those mobilisations marked an important gap between the government s conception of the society and the real state of resistance  this article studies three main hypotheses regarding the potential of the protest movement in russia  the hypotheses were drawn from recent sociological  political and media studies on russian resistance  current research aims to contribute to the debate from the digital media perspective  it therefore evaluates three main assumptions  digital media have the potential to empower  dependent upon the relevant political  social and economic factors  digital media isolates protest publics and therefore may be more useful for the government than the resistance  and recent censorship of digital media communication signals a tightening of both formal and informal restrictions against opposition and protest politics  this article uses theoretical and factual evidence on the limitations of democracy and the public sphere and conceptualises the government s management of resistance in russia during and after the 2011 2012 protests  it studies how the hybrid political regime in russia balances restrictions on freedom of speech with strengthened state propaganda and how it mediates media oppression and invites self censorship  finally  it examines how the state communication watchdog has recently focused its attention at the digital realm  this move confirms the importance of the online protest communication for the russian political environment  yet the state s acknowledgement of digital political resistance may lead to further oppression and curbing of this emerging component of russian politics  
 demographic change and fiscal sustainability in asia changes in the population age structure can have significant effects on fiscal sustainability since they can affect both government revenue and expenditure  in this paper  we project government revenue  expenditure  and fiscal balance in developing asia up to 2050 using a simple stylized model and the national transfer accounts data set  rapidly aging countries are likely to suffer a tangible deterioration of fiscal sustainability under their current tax and expenditure system  on the other hand  rapid economic growth can improve fiscal health in poorer  relatively young countries with still growing working age populations  overall  our results indicate that asia s population aging will adversely affect its fiscal sustainability  pointing to a need for asian countries to further examine the impact of demographic shifts on their fiscal health  
 depression in later life  a closer look at the gender gap gender differences in depressive symptoms have been extensively documented  with women reporting a higher number of depressive symptoms than men  however  studies offer different explanations for why such a gap exists  the goal of the current paper is to analyze how much of the observed gender gap in depression may be attributed to  1  compositional versus  2  reporting differences or  3  differences in reactivity to adversities  we contribute to this literature by testing  net of compositional differences  whether the relationship between reporting behavior and depressive symptoms is gendered and whether accounting for the possibility of gender specific reactivity alters the structure of the gender gap at older ages  our results show that the observed gender gap in depression  1  only partially derives from compositional differences   2  is not an artifact of a gender specific reporting style  and remarkably  3  men appear more sensitive to adversities   c  2017 elsevier inc  all rights reserved  
 detroit and the political origins of  broken windows  policing the authors argue that  broken windows  policing strategies  promoted officially as a means of reducing crime  though criticised by liberals for the potentially discriminatory impact on non whites  should rather be viewed as an integral component of the state s attempts to coercively manage the contradictions of capitalism  taking issue with wacquant  they stress the need to situate policing strategies in terms of the resistances waged by racialised surplus populations  examining detroit  they provide a history  spanning the years between the great depression and the aftermath of the great rebellion in 1967  which was  at the time  the largest civil uprising in us history  to contextualise the introduction of stop and frisk in the mid 1960s  this policy  they argue  was predominantly part of an attempt to contain and repress the political threat emerging from the active and reserve sections of the black working class  they go on to analyse the  broken windows  strategies in contemporary detroit so as to situate them in relationship to other processes in the now bankrupt motor city  such as home foreclosures  water shutoffs  and investment and gentrification in the greater downtown area  
 developing a culturally specific mixed methods approach to global research with much of the development of mixed methods occurring through the works of scholars from the us  the uk  canada  and the anglos saxon english speaking countries  the discourse about a global research community must consider how it needs to be sensitive to diverse cultures  clearly  the discussion must focus on adapting mixed methods to best fit the problems of countries  the cultural norms of conducting research  and the scholarly talents of in country investigators  unfortunately  the mixed methods literature is largely silent on diverse cultural adaptations of mixed methods  in this article  we first trace the involvement of worldwide countries in the historic development of mixed methods  then  to gain a better understanding of the use and adaptation of mixed methods in diverse world academic cultures  we provide a qualitative study of themes mentioned by participants from seven different countries  from both the historical overview and the qualitative study  we end by making suggestions about specific strategies for a global discourse about mixed methods research  and suggest a de colonizing presence of the anglo saxon english speaking countries in the global expansion of mixed methods  
 developing terra nullius  colonialism  nationalism  and indigeneity in the andaman islands this article explores the legal structures and discursive framings informing the governance of one particular backward region of india  the andaman islands  i trace the shifting patterns of occupation and development of the islands in the colonial and postcolonial periods  with a focus on the changes wrought by independence in 1947 and the eventual history of planned development there  i demonstrate how intersecting discourses of indigenous savagery primitivism and the geographical emptiness were repeatedly mobilized in colonial era surveys and postcolonial policy documents  postcolonial visions of developing the andaman islands ushered in a settler colonial governmentality  infused with genocidal fantasies of the dying savage  laws professing to protect aboriginal jarawas actually worked to unilaterally extend indian sovereignty over the lands and bodies of a community clearly hostile to such incorporation  i question the current exclusion of india from the global geographies of settler colonialism and argue that the violent and continuing history of indigenous marginalization in the andaman islands represents a de facto operation of a logic of terra nullius  
 development of organic agriculture in bulgaria  1990 2012   actors  relations  and networks this article analyses the development of organic agriculture  oa  in bulgaria  it especially examines the actors  relations  and structures that shape organic sector policies  the bulgarian case shows that sectorial agricultural policies can originate without the direct representation of farmers  due to the dominance of consultancy ngos and academic institutions in the policy network  oa first appeared as a political rather than as an economic or social and agricultural topic  however  this specificity contributed to the weak development of the organic sector in the country  ultimately  farmers became engaged in the policy network for the benefit of the sector when the eu implemented organic subsidies  the article is based on both qualitative and quantitative data and applies the policy network approach as the analytical framework  our analysis contributes to enriching this approach by exploring the role of the state in terms of both political willingness and administrative capacity and shows that in a post socialist context  the policy outcome also depends on the synchronisation of these two roles of the state  
 diaspora  authenticity and the imagined past ancestral tourism in scotland  a sector of the heritage tourism market sensitive to consumer personalisation  has particular propensities towards process driven co created experiences  these experiences occur within existing categories of object based and existential notions of authenticity alongside an emergent category of the  authentically imagined past   the latter of these modes reveals a complex interplay between professionally endorsed validation of the empirical veracity of objects  documents and places and deeply held  authentically imagined  narratives of  home   these narratives  built up in the diaspora over centuries  drive new processes towards authenticity in tourism  we conducted 31 interviews across 27 sites throughout scotland with curators  archivists  and volunteers to explore these notions of authenticity within the ancestral tourism context   c  2017 elsevier ltd  all rights reserved  
 dick pics on blast  a woman s resistance to online sexual harassment using humour  art and instagram this article brings to attention and explores women s use of non traditional forms of resistance to online sexual harassment  in this piece we use anna gensler s instagram art project instagranniepants to examine how women are appropriating the language and practices of the cyber realm to expose online sexual harassment and to engender a creative resistance which is critical  comedic and entertaining  drawing from interdisciplinary literature on witnessing  satire and shaming  we explore the techniques gensler uses to not only document harassment but also resist  engage and punish those who seek to perpetrate it  this article problematises the stereotype of women as passive victims of online public spaces  and is critical of popular discourses that portray online spaces as exclusively risky and that position women as the natural victims of online violence  it concludes that a more nuanced account of women s negotiation of online spaces is necessary  particularly as an overarching narrative of risk and victimisation undermines the liberatory potential of the online realm  
 dietary regimes and the nutrition transition  bridging disciplinary domains the nutrition transition concept developed by popkin has gained wide currency within the nutritional sciences literature as a way of understanding population wide changes to diet and energy balance and their related health outcomes in society  it offers a useful template of different nutritional patterns societies progress through  but it has not provided a comprehensive understanding of the why and how of dietary change  building on insights from the literature on food regimes in the social sciences  this paper argues the concept of dietary regimes can augment the nutrition transition model and can serve as a bridge between social and health sciences around nutrition and dietary change  the political economy analysis of the dietary regime approach provides insights into the historical degradation of food and the diffusion of nutrient poor products throughout food environments today  it also engages analysis of the key actors shaping food environments and diets in the industrial era  the dietary regime approach can provide fruitful directions with respect to concrete policy options to address the major issue of population wide weight gain that the nutrition transition model has sought to confront in recent iterations  
 digital capitalism and the end of politics  the case of the italian five star movement in the italian national elections in 2013  the movimento cinque stelle  five star movement  m5s   founded just four years earlier  gained 25 percent of votes  more than any other party  analyses and interpretations are divided between those who consider m5s a member of the family of european populism and those who see m5s s propositions as akin to the values of the left and social movements  the debate on m5s fits into the context of important ongoing trends in european politics  the growth of populist political movements  the emergence of outsider parties able to challenge stable political systems  changing relationships between parties and social movements  changes in the forms of political organizing  this article investigates the political and cultural nature of this party by  1  analyzing its discourse on democracy  its organizational choices and its main issues   2  comparing these elements with populism and the left  and  3  linking its fundamental characteristics to contemporary economic processes usually termed  digital capitalism

 digitizing sacks  approaching social media as data during the course of this article  we explore ethnomethodological principles in relation to approaching social media as data  more specifically  we consider the extent to which the work of harvey sacks and his rich intellectual legacy might inform this nascent field of empirical inquiry  this exploration is realised in the context of interdisciplinary research at the interface of social and computational science  drawing from an extensive range of empirical projects into social media we reflect on the efficacy and limitations of these principles  sacks  1992  for understanding social media interaction as open data and practical action in the digital age  
 disability and activity related emotion in later life  are effects buffered by intimate relationship support and strain  we use daily diary data from the disability and use of time supplement to the 2013 panel study of income dynamics  n   1 162  to evaluate  1  the extent to which marital partner support and strain moderate the effects of disability on five activity related emotions  happiness  calm  sadness  frustration  worry  and overall negative and positive emotion among older married  cohabiting  and dating persons and  2  whether such patterns differ significantly by gender  marital support buffers against negative emotions and increases feelings of calm among severely impaired women  by contrast  support intensifies negative emotions and decreases feelings of calm among severely impaired men  relationship strain also intensifies the effect of severe impairment on men s frustration  sadness  worry  and negative mood but has negligible effects on the negative emotions of men with low impairment and women  frequent support and criticism may threaten highly impaired older men s sense of autonomy and emotional well being  
 disability and social participation  the case of formal and informal volunteering people with disabilities in the united states experience lower levels of social integration than people without disabilities  however  less is known about the association between disability and volunteer participation despite an extensive literature on other disparities in volunteerism  this study uses data from the 2009 2015 volunteer supplement of the current population survey to evaluate how working aged adults with sensory disabilities  cognitive disabilities  physical disabilities  or multiple disabilities access  participate in  and maintain volunteer roles  net of sociodemographic characteristics  adults with disabilities are no less likely than those without disabilities to report informal volunteering  although the presence of physical and multiple disabilities negatively associates with formal volunteering  adults with disabilities report no fewer annual hours or weeks than those without disabilities if they are formal volunteers  but the mechanism through which they initially become involved in volunteer organizations varies  people with different types of disability experience different patterns of volunteering  and the sociodemographic characteristics associated with having a disability exacerbate many of these differences  results suggest that adults with disabilities can and do participate in voluntary work  but may face barriers to accessing formal volunteer roles   c  2017 elsevier inc  all rights reserved  
 disclosure stress  social support  and depressive symptoms among cisgender bisexual youth bisexual youth are at elevated risk for depression when compared with lesbians and gay men  research on bisexual stigma suggests that these youth are uniquely vulnerable to stress related to sexual identity disclosure  depression associated with this stress may be buffered by social support from parents and friends  we examined the differential influence of social support from parents and friends  child and adolescent social support scale  on the relation between disclosure stress  lgbtq coming out stress scale  and depressive symptoms  beck depression inventory  and differences by gender in a sample of cisgender bisexual youth  n 383  using structural equation modeling  parental support buffered the association between stressful disclosure to family and depressive symptoms  especially for bisexual men  bisexual women seemed not to benefit from such support when disclosure stress was high  this nuanced examination elucidates the ways family members and clinicians can best support bisexual youth sexual identity disclosure  
 discordant fandom and global football brands   let the people sing  this article has three main objectives  our first is to turn to sport as a particularly illuminating and revealing example of consumer culture in the making  marketplace logic suffuses consumer culture  and exploring practices of fandom as performed thus becomes particularly revealing of the tensions and contradictions which are thrown up when passions collide with finance and branding strategies  our second objective is to mobilise this insight to further research on brand communities through better situating social practices as entangled in this heady nexus of passions  power and cultural politics  through a netnographic analysis of forum posts from celtic football club s notorious  green brigade  ultras style fan group  we focus on how such social formations forge counter identities  which act not in harmony with the larger brand ethos but serve to legitimate and affirm a counter philosophy  as such  our final objective is to better understand the roles of brand agitator and brand heretic as key roles within this contested social formation  fandom as dramatic ritual and social drama brings in its wake contradictions and tensions especially when it goes toe to toe with the forces of economics  branding and marketing strategy  here  a counter brand community as we reveal mobilises marketplace logic and appears to adopt their own practices of mimicking brand strategising for their own ends  or as they assert   let the people sing   
 discrimination and well being  the moderating effects of agentic value orientations experiences of discrimination significantly deteriorate both subjective well being and health  yet some people are more resilient to these negative effects than others  previous research has considered factors such as identity or socioeconomic status that can help people cope with discrimination  however  the literature has not yet considered the ways in which agentic value orientations may moderate the negative effect of discrimination upon well being  this paper addresses this gap by focusing on the moderating role of openness versus conservation  and self enhancement versus self transcendence values as agentic orientations  analyzing the european social survey round 6  2012  with multi level models  this study demonstrates that both individual and national level agentic orientations moderate some of the effects of discrimination on well being an health  these findings suggest that agentic values are potentially important cognitive resources from which individuals derive strength from when faced with adverse social experiences  
 discrimination related anger  religion  and distress  differences between african americans and caribbean black americans the charleston emanuel african methodist episcopal church  amec  survivors  forgiveness of the racially motivated shootings prompted our research of the association between religion  discrimination related anger  and psychological distress among black americans  using the first representative national sample of caribbean black americans  the national survey of american life  we examine if discrimination related anger produces more psychological distress for african americans than caribbean black americans and if religious emotional support lowers distress from discrimination related anger  our findings show discrimination related anger is associated with less distress for caribbean black americans than african americans  religious emotional support is associated with lower levels of distress and buffers the mental health of later generation caribbean black americans who report anger  african americans reporting discrimination without anger show lower levels of psychological distress than their counterparts who experience anger  thus  we have partial support that mercy towards one s transgressor  illustrated by the charleston emanuel amec survivors  may benefit mental health  
 disentangling the reciprocal relationship between change in crime and racial ethnic change prior research has found that racial ethnic change and residential instability are positively related to neighborhood crime  however  the process of racial ethnic change differentially influences crime above and beyond residential instability  while both processes affect crime through the disruption of existing social ties  racial ethnic change has additional consequences for crime by heightening racial ethnic tensions and undercutting cross group interactions  this means racial ethnic change is a different process than residential instability  and suggests that neighborhoods experiencing high rates of instability and high rates of racial ethnic change may be particularly susceptible to crime  therefore  we examine the influence of racial ethnic compositional change on change in crime across different levels of residential instability  further  we argue that demographic change and crime may be influencing each other simultaneously  increases in the crime rate and racial ethnic compositional change impact each other at the same time  to capture this process  we employ a structural equation model  sem  that accounts for the reciprocal and simultaneous relationship between racial ethnic change and violent and property crime rates in los angeles  california between 1990 and 2000  we also account for the influence of change in spatially proximate communities  results show robust evidence that increases in racial ethnic change contributes to greater violent and property crime rates  but the reciprocal influence of crime on racial ethnic change is contingent upon the degree to which a neighborhood is experiencing residential instability and crime type   c  2017 elsevier inc  all rights reserved  
 disinformation and the media  the case of russia and ukraine the ongoing conflict between russia and ukraine can be analyzed as an instance where the internet has strengthened the power of political actors to create disinformation  but it is no longer only the state supported media monopoly that produces and disseminates propaganda  citizens themselves actively participate in their own disenfranchisement by using social media to generate  consume or distribute false information  contributing to a new order where disinformation acquires increasing authority  this essay follows disinformation practices through the transition from broadcast to social media in post soviet times and theorizes how the coexistence of old and new media in the production of propaganda might inform our understanding of future scenarios  including in western democracies  
 disrupting household food consumption through experimental homelabs  outcomes  connections  contexts this article explores the implications of conceptualising  designing and implementing experimental sites seeking to support more sustainable home based eating practices  or homelabs for brevity  building on earlier phases of practice oriented participatory backcasting and transition framework construction  the homelabs involved collaboration with public  private and civil society sectors and with the members of participating households  these collaborations identified a suite of supportive socio technological  informational and governance interventions that mimicked  as far as possible  the characteristics of promising practices for sustainable eating developed through backcasting and transition planning  the implemented interventions enabled householders to question  disassemble and reconfigure their eating practices onto more sustainable pathways across the integrated practices of food acquisition  storage  preparation and waste management  this process generated manifold insights into household eating practices  and this article focuses specifically on key outcomes of the homelabs  and the significance of social context  social relations and micropolitics of everyday life in shaping those outcomes  in particular  the homelabs findings reinforce calls to connect  combine and align product  regulatory  informational and motivational supports across the interdependent practices of eating  acquisition  storage and preparation and waste recovery  to optimise transitions towards sustainability  offering a lens to interrogate interventions for sustainable food consumption in the home  this article provides a novel exercise in operationalising social practice theory  
 division of childcare in two biological parent and step parent households  importance of parental gender and type of partnership in contrast to previous  single gender studies on step parents  participation in childcare  i use the pooled generations and gender survey to address the following questions   i  is there a gender difference in the potential divergence in how childcare is organized in two biological parent and step parent households  i e  are there larger differences between type of mother and type of father families   and  ii  does the type of partnership  marital non marital cohabitation  matter for how childcare is divided in step parent households and if it does  does it matter more for step mothers or step fathers  the findings from the country level fixed effect models show that whereas the difference between type of father households is negligible  the gap between type of mother households is significantly larger  particularly  in non marital cohabitations  the findings are more pronounced for the division of physical  e g  taking care of child when sick  than interactive  e g  helping child with homework  tasks  the proposition is put forward that these findings stem from the higher ambiguity which surrounds the parenting role of step mothers compared to that of step fathers  
 do anti immigrant laws shape public sentiment  a study of arizona s sb 1070 using twitter data scholars have debated whether laws can influence public opinion  but evidence of these feedback effects is scant  this article examines the effect of arizona s 2010 high profile anti immigrant law  sb 1070  on both public attitudes and behaviors toward immigrants  using sentiment analysis and a difference in difference approach to analyze more than 250 000 tweets  the author finds that sb 1070 had a negative impact on the average sentiment of tweets regarding immigrants  mexicans  and hispanics  but not on those about asians or blacks  however  these changes in public discourse were not caused by shifting attitudes toward immigrants but by the mobilization of anti immigrant users and by motivating new users to begin tweeting  while some scholars propose that punitive laws can shape people s attitudes toward targeted groups  this study shows that policies are more likely to influence behaviors  rather than placating the electorate  anti immigrant laws may stir the pot further  mobilizing individuals already critical of immigrants  
 do individuals with high social background graduate from more rewarding fields of study  changing patterns before and after the  bologna process  in this article we investigate whether  in italy  social background is related to graduation from more rewarding fields of study and if horizontal inequalities in higher education changed before and after the  bologna process   we analyse fields of study  fos  as a categorical variable  as well as a quantitative variable measuring the expected returns in terms of probability of entering the upper classes  net of unemployment risks   we use five cross sectional waves of the italian graduates employment survey  1998 2011  with more than 115 000 cases  applying multinomial and fractional logistic regression models  we found that individuals from socio economically advantaged backgrounds graduate from subjects that guarantee higher chances to enter the upper classes  horizontal inequalities related to fos of graduation grew over time  in line with the effectively maintained inequality thesis  a more pronounced increase in class based inequalities occurred after the implementation of the  bologna process   unlike what was found in the us  a large part of the social background differentials are not due to high school record before entering higher education  
 do integration policies relate to economic and cultural threat perceptions  a comparative study in europe in this article  we analyse the relationship between integration policies and perceived intergroup threat across european countries  by distinguishing between several strands of integration policies and forms of threat  economic vs cultural   we attempt to shed more light on the mechanisms underlying the policy threat nexus  we combine data from the european values study of 2008 and the migration integration policy index of 2007  resulting in a sample of 29 844 native residents in 27 countries  on which we apply multilevel analysis  the outcomes of the analysis reveal that respondents living in a country with more inclusive integration policies   more specifically  policies aimed at labour market access and political participation   display lower perceptions of economic threat  by contrast  integration policies are not significantly associated with perceptions of cultural threat  
 doctors  reflexivity in hospital organisations  the nexus between institutional and behavioural dynamics in the sociology of professions this article seeks to provide a clearer picture of how the nexus between institutional and behavioural dynamics operates among doctors in hospital organisations  on the basis of qualitative  in depth research conducted in a hospital organisation  with the focus on doctors from two wards  differences in their actions and discourses challenge the coherence associated with professional and organisational values found in the debates in the sociology of professions  rather than denying these influences  the article relates them to the way professionals reflexively make use of their roles in situated circumstances  therefore  it discusses not only the fact that the doctors  medical rationale is crisscrossed by a diversity of influences   ethics  management and the organisational culture and subcultures   but also that they make reflexive deliberations on the basis of interests related to specific contexts  the analysis builds on recent discussions in neo institutionalism aligned with critical realism  in order to refine theoretical arguments on reflexivity while providing tools for future empirical research in the sociology of professions

 does consumer confidence forecast household saving and borrowing behavior  evidence for poland consumer confidence plays an important role in households  decision making processes  this study investigates the effects of consumer confidence on household saving and borrowing behavior that are unsatisfactorily considered in previous discussions  the questions of interest are first  whether indexes of consumer confidence have any predictive power on their own for future household saving and borrowing rates  and second  whether they contain information about future household saving and borrowing rates aside from the information contained in other available indicators  in addition to aggregate confidence indicators  their components are used to provide more precise information  overall  the multiple linear regression analysis  ols technique  of polish time series data gives positive answers to both questions  this finding supports the recommendation of combining the strengths of objective indicators  such as economic fundamentals  and subjective indicators  such as consumer confidence  to improve household financial behavior forecasts  
 does poverty on youth affect poverty in adulthood  an analysis for spain the correlation of economic  social and educational achievements between generations of the same family is a matter of great interest for the analysis of equal opportunities in society  the aim of this article is to quantify the impact and extent of the intergenerational transmission of poverty in spain  using data from the specific module on the intergenerational transmission of economic disadvantage in the 2011 life conditions survey  propensity score matching was used to study the relationship between the economic disadvantage of one generation and the next  the results show that having economic disadvantage during adolescence increases the probability of poverty in adulthood  this impact has been reduced in younger generations  
 does tourism consumption behaviour mirror differences in living standards  based on the theoretical foundation of well being measurement  the study explores differences in living standards by analysing the distribution of tourism expenditure  a mixture of regression models is used to explore the heterogeneity in tourism consumption by identifying groups of families with similar tourism consumption behaviour as a function of certain socio demographic and economic factors  the empirical analysis  performed on italian expenditure data  suggests that there are three different patterns of consumption behaviour conditional to the socio demographic and economic covariates in the tourism market and that differences in tourism consumption between groups of households mirror inequalities in living standards

 doing  dangerous  autoethnography on islamophobic victimization this article draws on our different experiences of employing autoethnography when researching islamophobia  using two independent research projects  in particular  we reflect upon our experiences of islamophobic victimization as a result of being visibly  muslim in public spaces in the uk  we discuss our motivation for employing autoethnography and the role of our insider outsider status in adopting the role of the muslim other  in public spaces  additionally  we consider the nature  extent and impact of islamophobic victimization upon ourselves  and the coping mechanisms we employed to deal with it  the article concludes by reflecting upon the advantages  ethical challenges and limitations of using autoethnography when researching islamophobic victimization  
 doing digital team ethnography  being there together and digital social data with the digital availability of social data helping reshape ethnographic research and thus broadening the mainstream understanding of ethnography  this research proposes a set of strategies to overcome current limitations in doing ethnography  based on a two year online and offline ethnographic project on social media use in later life  insights are provided into how the practices and meanings of ethnography are being reconstructed and negotiated in response to the explosion of digital social data and through team practices  this paper reviews how collaborative and interdisciplinary ethnographic reflection is sustained and extended by digital tools  creating a live source of data that can be analysed within the framework of ethnography  as a contribution to current debates on the  social life of methods   it also reviews epistemic issues associated with digital data and team ethnography  such as the role of the ethnographer s   the field s  and computational data analysis  the article reaches the conclusion that digital team ethnography is a viable option for undertaking thick and descriptive studies about the use of social media  which in turn favours a collaborative  non hierarchical and dialogue driven knowledge production process  
 doing testing  how concrete competence can facilitate or inhibit performances of children with autism spectrum disorder this article contributes to the sociology of science and technology through the study of language use and social interaction  as an analysis of how clinicians examine children to diagnose developmental disabilities  it involves the sociology of testing and standardization  with our particular focus on autism spectrum disorders  whereas previous research has concentrated primarily on the outcomes of testing  such as diagnostic trends  little has been written about the tests by which these trends are produced  our analysis shows how psychometric tests operate to shape the interactive environments  those established by the test instrument  scoring metrics  etc    additionally  the interactional environment  the practices by which protocols are implemented as clinician and child do the test  exerts an influence on performance  in short  the interactive and interactional environment may affect the measurement of ability and difference in children  we propose that the emphasis of clinical tests on measuring second order  abstract competence or the ability to produce general answers to theoretical questions may obscure various kinds of first order  concrete competence and  autistic intelligence  a child displays  as forms of first order  concrete competence  we examine orientation in situ to testing history  narrative combinations of test items  and using filler words for test item answers

 dream homes and dead ends in the city  a photo essay experiment research focused on the relationship between place and health demonstrates that it is complex and shifting  as overlapping social  historical  institutional and political and economic processes continually transform the landscapes in which lived experiences are embedded  understanding this relationship requires knowledge of the situated meanings and local worlds that ethnographic methods are well suited to investigate  however  even conventional ethnographic methods can be inadequate to capture the embodied  lived experience of place   experiences in which the sensory and inner processes of memory and imagination are often privileged  accessing these experiences and processes can require more experimental methodological approaches  in this article  i present work from a series of photo essays created between 2011 and 2016 by 15 young people who inhabit the social  spatial and economic margins of vancouver  canada  and discuss some of the challenges and opportunities presented by this methodology  created over 5 years  and broadly focused on how they understood  experienced and navigated their place  in the city in the midst of poverty  addiction  violence and physical and mental health crises  the photo essays young people produced are embedded with personal biographies and trajectories  as well as shared experiences of geography  precarity and possibility in vancouver  
 dualisms shaping human nature relations  discovering the multiple meanings of social ecological change in wayanad this paper reflects on the impacts of agrarian change and social reorganisation on gender nature relations through the lens of an indigenous group named the kuruma in south india  building upon recent work of feminist political ecology  i uncover a number of dualisms attached to the gender nature nexus and put forward that gender roles are constituted by social relations which need to be analysed with regard to the transformative potential of gender nature relations  three main themes are at the centre of the empirical inquiry  gender subjectivities  rural off farm employment and the human nature nexus  i seek to show that  first  the production of gendered subjectivities cannot be simplified through essentialist assumptions that romanticise women s relationships with nature  second  off farm employment strategies both reinforce the social hierarchy in gender and contradict the kuruma s moral economies  and  finally  environmental and agrarian change redefine the use of agrobiodiversity and are related to ideas on progressive versus nonprogressive cultivation practices  the research is informed by qualitative research methods and offers a conceptual approach to the deconstruction of gender nature relations from a poststructuralist feminist perspective  
 dualization as destiny  the political economy of the german minimum wage reform germany is widely seen as a  dualized  economy driven by a powerful and stable  insider  coalition in the manufacturing sectors  in this article  that picture is challenged  an examination of the political economy of the outsider friendly 2014 minimum wage act  using public opinion data  document analysis  and qualitative interviews  shows how earlier dualizing reforms led to unintended negative feedback effects  first  public opinion reacted negatively to increasing inequality in the years preceding the introduction of the minimum wage  second  a remarkable shift is found among trade unions toward support of a minimum wage  even in manufacturing  although the threat of low wage competition and flexibilization did play a role  trade union solidarity was at least as important  those endogenous dynamics came together in a self undermining process unfolding over a relatively short period of time  potential alternative explanations are explored  including classical partisan politics  party competition  and employer preferences  
 dynamics between doctors and managers in the italian national health care system this article focuses on the changes in the italian nhs by concentrating on patterns in the managerialisation of doctors  it addresses a series of shortcomings in studies on the response by doctors to managerialisation  the first is a shortcoming of theoretical and analytical nature  it is necessary to adopt a broader perspective whereby analysis considers not only the interaction between doctors and managers  but also the public control and regulation agencies that operate in that field  the second shortcoming is a methodological one  the literature on managerialisation is more theoretical than applied  it is necessary to adopt a strategy based on a plurality of methodologies and sources in order to focus attention on a national case  italy in the present study   discussing the changes over time  from the beginning of managerialisation until today  and considering different groups within the medical profession  the outcome is a complex picture of the dynamics between doctors and managers which foregrounds the managerial co optation processes of a small group of national health service doctors  the transition from strategic adaptation to forms of resistance against managerialisation by the majority of italian nhs doctors  and the emergence of restratification processes among self employed doctors working with the nhs  
 early women  late men  timing attitudes and gender differences in marriage around the world  women marry earlier than men  but it is not well understood why this gender gap exists  using panel data collected in nepal  the authors investigate whether attitudes about marital timing held by unmarried youth and their parents account for women marrying earlier than men  they also examine whether the influence of timing attitudes differs by gender  on average  unmarried youth and their parents viewed 20 to 25 as acceptable ages for women to marry  whereas ages 23 to 30 were appropriate for men  in turn  women entering the acceptable marriage age range earlier than men accounted for a third of the gender gap in marital timing  the influence of youth and parents  timing attitudes did differ by gender  but only at the extreme  when they were much too young for marriage  both genders were less likely to marry  but this dampening effect was substantially larger for women  
 ecological validity through mixed methods designs qualitative interviews as a complement to standardized measures of prejudice due to their focus on variable oriented comparisons and large n samples  survey methods are prone to lack information on the context specific  practical meaning of measured constructs  this issue is explicated via the concept of  ecological validity   a sequential quantitative qualitative mixed methods study on anti american prejudice in germany is presented to demonstrate how semi structured qualitative interviews  n   22  can compensate for lacking ecological validity in standardized prejudice measurements  cati survey  n   808  summer 2011   qualitative analyses provide context sensitive insight into the rhetorical functions of anti american speech  they are used to generate explanatory hypotheses for correlations between anti american  anti semitic  and racist prejudice in the survey data  this complementarity of research methods is closely connected to an enhanced theoretical perspective  the combination of attitude based and speech act theoretical concepts of prejudice helps to increase construct validity in the example study

 effect of managers  organizational justice understanding on the level of employees  organizational commitment and job satisfaction the study  which is frequently discussed organizational attitude and behaviours in the literature  direct and indirect effects of organizational justice  organizational commitment  and job satisfaction  are studied through a holistic model  but this study is varied from other studies as carrying out defense industry  it is aimed to have all effects on the variables by choosing structural equations modeling  research problem is whether job satisfaction of employees working in defense industry has an impact by organizational justice and organizational commitment  data collected by surveys are analysed via spss and amos programs and some recommendations are made to manager and employees in both sector and general  when results are evaluated in the general sense  for the employees  who work in defend industry  the organizational justice affects job satisfaction partly  as a result  it is concluded that organizational justice partially affects job satisfaction  and the organizational commitment plays a mediator role in the relations  
 electoral participation  how to measure voter turnout  in the comparative turnout literature  there are two ways of measuring voter turnout   1  voter turnout as the percentage of registered voters that actually turn out  rv turnout  and  2  voter turnout as the percentage of a country s voting age population that cast their ballot on election day  vap turnout   both measurements are imprecise  the former overestimates turnout  the latter either underestimates or overestimates turnout  in this article  i introduce a more accurate calculation of macro level electoral participation into the comparative turnout literature  the percentage of eligible voters or vep turnout  to do so  i first calculate vep turnout and add it to a dataset on electoral turnout that covers more than 500 elections conducted in democracies from 1990 to 2012  second  i use a standard turnout model and highlight that the constituents of turnout somewhat differ across rv turnout  vap turnout  and vep turnout  
 elite and ethical  the defensive distinctions of middle class bicycling in bangalore  india this article applies social practice theory to study the emergence of sustainable consumption practices like bicycling among the new middle classes of bangalore  india  i argue that expansions of bicycling practices are dependent on the construction of defensive distinctions  which i define as distinctions that draw equally on lifestyle based and ethics based discourses to normalize bicycling among bangalore s middle classes  with their environmental discourses and signage  middle class cyclists make claims to being ethical actors and ecological citizens concerned about global environments  their high end bicycles and special gear enable them to maintain their social status in personal and professional circles  despite adopting what is an essentialized and stigmatized mobility practice in a social context where personal automobiles are a dominant symbol of respectability and propertied citizenship  these defensive distinctions are anchored in communities that facilitate social learning  skill building  and the creation of collective identities  i highlight the importance of considering the role of ethical discourses in consolidating low status social practices among high status class fractions and discuss the implications of promoting sustainable consumption through the othering of the poor  by applying a social practice analytic to study middle class bicycling practices  this article makes a significant contribution to the growing literature that investigates the applicability of practice based approaches to environmental behaviors and sustainable consumption in a novel context  
 elite military cues and public opinion about the use of military force do military endorsements influence americans  political and foreign policy views  we find that senior military officers have the ability to nudge public attitudes under certain conditions  through a series of large  survey based experiments  with nearly 12 000 completed interviews from national samples  we find that participants respond to survey questions in predictable ways depending on whether they have been prompted with information about the views of senior military leaders on the very same questions  when told that senior military leaders oppose particular interventions abroad  public opposition to that intervention increases  endorsements of support boost public support but by a smaller magnitude  subsequent causal mediation analysis suggests that military opinion influences public opinion primarily through its impact on a mission s perceived legitimacy and  to a lesser degree  it s perceived likelihood of success  
 elite mobility among college graduated men in sweden  skills  personality and family ties using swedish registry data  we study the chances of mobility into the swedish labour market elite for men who graduated in the years 1985 2005  the elite is defined as top earners within mid  and large sized firms and within the public sector organisations  henceforth  we use organisation for both firms and public organisations   using discrete time event history models  we study the incidence of elite entry in terms of external recruitment and internal promotion  the choice of field of study and of college or university are important  as are personality and  to a limited extent  cognitive ability  what is most striking is that having kin in elite positions increases the chance of elite entry in general  and having parents in top positions in the same organisation increases the likelihood of internal promotion  in sum  elite entry among college educated males is associated with a diversity of factors  suggesting that complex explanations for labour market success should be considered  where skills  personality  and family ties all seem to matter  
 embassy cinema  what wikileaks reveals about us state support for hollywood in an article for foreign affairs at the outbreak of the world war ii  film producer walter wanger referred to hollywood movies as 120 000 american ambassadors   the preeminence of hollywood in presenting us ideology to the world has been asserted ever since  yet the relationship between hollywood and america s actual ambassadors  employed by the global network of american embassies  has rarely been investigated  despite the key role that this often overlooked aspect of the state apparatus plays in the maintenance of hollywood s commercial interests and american cultural hegemony  the release by wikileaks in november 2010 of over 250 000 diplomatic cables has provided an opportunity to address this gap  by offering researchers an unparalleled insight into the worldwide network of american embassies  this article employs these documents to explain how these embassies have influenced global film policies since early 2003  and the implications they have for conceptions of american power in the wake of the war on terror   
 emergency futures  exception  urgency  interval  hope emergency as a descriptor  technique and legal political device has become a taken for granted way of apprehending and governing events and situations  in this paper  i explore the temporality of emergency  through reflections on the use of declarations of emergency in relation to us based black lives matter protests  i do so in the context of claims and counter claims about contemporary transformations in what rheinhart kosselleck  2004  241  terms the  expected otherness of the future   arguing for changes in the form of the  expected otherness of the future  rather than its simple loss  disappearance or absence  i describe how emergency operates around a temporality of exceptionality  urgency and interval  formal and informal declarations of emergency are  in addition  imbued with hope  the hope that time remains and action can make a difference to events  what the use of declarations of emergency by black lives matter activists does is disrupt the geo historically specific divide between the everyday and emergency by naming conditions that mix the endemic and the evental as emergencies  in the spark of hope that is the act of declaring that ongoing conditions should be treated as emergencies  the  otherness of the future  folds into and becomes part of the present  
 employment management work  a case study and theoretical framework managing employment and labor market experiences is a critical activity for virtually all adults but it is undertheorized in the sociology of work  in this article  we argue for the concept of employment management work  referring to the generic  lifelong process in which everyone in a capitalist market economy engages to some degree  to grasp the significance of employment management work  we draw on and synthesize multiple streams of literature and then analyze a set of in depth interviews from a study of low wage workers in an effort to bridge these literatures and to highlight salient features of a theory of employment management work  
 empowering justice  an intersectional feminist perspective on restorative justice in the sex trade restorative justice might seem like a benign alternative to prison  but it is full of pitfalls  particularly when it is still enmeshed in the criminal justice system  nowhere is this more true than with sex workers  who are either punished for their work or morally castigated for it  the criminal justice system s interventions into the sex trade  even when using programs based on restorative justice  fails to address the harms and conflicts women experience in the sex trade and street economy  a major reason restorative programs fail to serve women in the sex trade is because it remains tethered to the criminal justice system  which carries traditional punitive consequences  when women entrenched in these conflicts are given the space  support  and freedom  they are able to develop relationships and resolutions that better exemplify restorative values  this paper explores the limitations of the current relationship between restorative justice and the criminal justice system and then highlights how the relationships and resistance strategies of the young women s empowerment project demonstrated restorative justice praxis in the sex trade  
 enacting big futures  little futures  toward an ecology of futures this paper concerns the ways in which futures are enacted  and thus mobilized  by publics  participants and practitioners  and especially by social scientists  in particular  the paper is interested in the assortment of futures within which we are seemingly embroiled  and how we analytically deal with the proliferation of futures  this is approached through the dramatization of futures as  big  or  little  in which change is more or less widespread and far reaching  the aim is to chart some of the ways in which big futures are analytically or rhetorically transformed into little and vice versa  and thus to throw into relief the mutability of futures per se  this discussion is developed by drawing on a particular area of social scientific inquiry  namely the  public understanding of science   pus  which also includes the field of  public engagement with science and technology   pest   the role for big futures  indexed by  controversiality   in this field  and the big future claims made by pus pest practitioners are contrasted to the little futures of everyday life  with the aid of a  speculative  sensibility  little futures are then shown to be potential sources of big futures  the paper ends with a preliminary attempt to theorize the complex interactions of big and little futures through isabelle stengers   2010  notion of an  ecology of practices   
 end impunity  reducing conflict related sexual violence to a problem of law whilst sexual violence has been an offence associated both with war  and peacetime throughout history  its rise to the tables where international peace and security are negotiated  represents a significant shift  this article continues the scholarly conversation about conflict related sexual violence and its emergence as a hot topic on academic  political  and activist agendas  specifically  we ask how and why criminal law constitutes the ultimately meaningful response to such violence  building on frame analysis  we address how the fight against conflict related sexual violence has become the fight against impunity  we examine what imageries of victims and perpetrators  causes and consequences key actors within interstate diplomacy and human rights advocacy evoke to drive this development  we argue that these narratives shape the political discourse on conflict related sexual violence  which may in turn influence the perceived political maneuverability in the face of such harms  
 enforcing labor standards in partnership with civil society  can co enforcement succeed where the state alone has failed  over the last decade  cities  counties  and states across the united states have enacted higher minimum wages  paid sick leave and family leave  domestic worker protections  wage theft laws  ban the box removal of questions about conviction history from job applications  and fair scheduling laws  nevertheless  vulnerable workers still do not trust government to come forward and report labor law violations  the article argues that while increasing the size of the labor inspectorate and engaging in strategic enforcement are necessary  they are not sufficient  it argues that co enforcement  in which government partners with organizations that have industry expertise and relationships with vulnerable workers  has the potential to manage the shifting and decentralized structures of twenty first century production  which were explicitly designed to evade twentieth century laws and enforcement capabilities  the article aims to contribute to a broader understanding of the role of organizations in enforcement and the circumstances in which their effectiveness can be maximized  it sets forth a set of scope conditions and mechanisms and examines empirical cases of co enforcement in austin  los angeles  and san francisco  the main findings are that co enforcement is most enduring when  1  government agencies and worker organizations recognize each other s unique capacities  rather than attempt to substitute for one another  2   the effort focuses on a specific industry  and  3  the collaboration receives strong political support  sustaining the impacts of co enforcement is found to require greater formalization of the partnership and funding streams  
 engaging conceptions of identity in a context of medical pluralism  explaining treatment choices for everyday illness in niger this article uses ethnographic research to reflect upon how the treatment of everyday  illnesses in niger engages concepts of social identity  inspired by bourdieu s concept of social distinction  as well as appadurai s edited volume on the social lives  of things   i present an analysis of how medications are understood by their users in terms of social and ideological meaning in one rural hausa village  decisions about medication choice were framed by three main themes  belonging to the modern  world  traditional  hausa culture  and religious identity  this article does not argue that these notions of identity fully explain medication use  nor necessarily predict treatment choices  the purpose of this paper is to reflect on the dynamic meanings given to treatment decisions after they have been made  attributed to the medications themselves and negotiated through their circulation in a context where multiple medical systems are drawn from to manage illness  producers and sellers of medication also engage these meaning centred concepts  which have theoretical and practical interest for the social sciences and public health

 entrepreneurship of women in the rural space in israel  catalysts and obstacles to enterprise development this article examines 100 women and their enterprises in moshav type co operative rural settlements in the rural urban fringe of tel aviv metropolitan area  israel  and analyses the catalysts and obstacles to development and expansion of such enterprises  most of the businesses are small  in the personal and service sector  and based on experience in past employment  the majority are located in homes or unused farming structures and constitute the major source of household income  major catalysts of development include the search for alternatives to waning farming income  self fulfilment  and professional development  main obstacles are shortage of capital and lack of self confidence in the ability to manage a business  the location is advantageous for fulfilling family obligations and saving costs  but problematic because of distance from central markets and intense local competition  the businesses play a crucial role in the survival strategy of rural households and help improve the quality of life and wellbeing in the region  
 environmental justice and care  critical emancipatory contributions to sustainability discourse sustainability has become a powerful discourse  guiding the efforts of various stakeholders to find strategies for dealing with current and future social ecological crises  to overcome the latter  we argue that sustainability discourse needs to be based on a critical emancipatory conceptualization  therefore  we engage two such approaches environmental justice approaches informed by a plural understanding of justice and feminist political economy ones focusing on care and their analytical potential for productive critique of normative assumptions in the dominant sustainability discourse  both of these approaches highlight aspects of sustainability that are particularly relevant today  first  although sustainable development was conceptualized from the outset based upon a twofold notion of justice  intra  and intergenerational   the integration of justice in the dominant sustainability discourse and praxis often manifests merely as a normative aspiration  meanwhile  the environmental justice and care approaches offer conceptualizations of justice that can act as a powerful lever and as transformation strategy  second  the dominant sustainability discourse largely remains within a neoliberal economic framework that continues to promote economic growth as the means to reach prosperity while neglecting the bases of every economy  care work and nature  its focus lies solely on paid work and the market economy  by integrating  a  social and ecological  reproductivity   unpaid care and subsistence work as well as nature  and  b  democratic processes for just distribution of environmental burdens and benefits  as well as participatory equity in relevant decision making  feminist political economy and environmental justice approaches offer substantial strategies towards building humane  just and caring societies

 escaping india s culture of education  migration desires among aspiring middle class young men research on indian overseas students in australia has shown that there is an intricate connection between class and migration processes  yet most of this work has focused on the experiences of students already abroad  research on the formulation of migration decisions and class dynamics from the sending side has been slow to emerge  this paper fills this gap and locates the analysis of migration desires within the literature on the indian middle classes  i demonstrate how a middle class culture of education that articulates hegemonic experiences  aspirations  and trajectories drives many aspiring middle class young men to consider migrating as an alternative path to social mobility  migration emerges as a temporary strategy geared towards accruing economic and cultural capital necessary for the fulfilment of class based personal ambitions and wider social responsibilities at home  migration is shown to stretch the boundaries of processes of class formation that now straddles multiple sites  resources  and aspirations  
 estimating income dependent relative income effects in the uk duesenberry s  income  saving  and the theory of consumer behavior  harvard university press  cambridge  1949  relative income hypothesis says that the utility of an individual depends not only on his absolute income level  but also on his relative income position in society  an individual gains utility if his income exceeds the income of most members in his comparison group and loses utility if his income falls below the income of most members in the group  many empirical studies already show that these relative income effects have a significant role in determining well being  however  most of them consider a symmetric case where the relative effects are homogenous among the population  or a simple version of an asymmetric case in which the population is categorized into two groups  conditioning on whether one s income level is higher or lower than the income level of his reference group  the nature of relative income effects may be much more complicated  however  as two similarly situated individuals may feel differently about their relative positions  the current analysis uses the british household panel survey to depict a broader heterogeneity income dependent relative income effects  to explore the empirical possibility of income dependent relative income effects  we regress a utility proxy on own income  the average income of the reference group  and an interaction of the two  results suggest that one s relative income effect indeed depends on one s current income level  
 estimating quality of life and place with location theory  the mcbucks index interest in quality of life and place  qol  has increased dramatically over the past few decades  traditionally  qol across geographic areas has been measured with two approaches  objective measures based on revealed preference theory via compensating differentials and subjective or stated preference approaches  while recent work has attempted to statistically link the two approaches  this paper presents a new alternative approach to measuring qol across geographic areas founded on location theory from the multidisciplinary field of regional science using chain store data  while highly correlated with the other two approaches  the index developed here is also easily and quickly updated and able to provide insights that are not available with the two traditional means  
 estranged labor  habitus  and verstehen in the rise of extreme endurance sports extreme endurance sporting events and participation in these events have grown exponentially since the 1970s  events such as iron distance triathlons  marathons  ultramarathons  ultradistance cycling  and military style obstacle courses now attract millions of participants in the united states annually  although many studies have analyzed this late 20th and early 21st century phenomenon from a microsociological perspective  looking at individual characteristics of participants  its broader relationship to class based changes in nature of work during the neoliberal period has not been thoroughly investigated  this article theorizes the rise of extreme endurance sports by uniting marx s conception of estranged labor under capital in the economic and philosophical manuscripts of 1844 with pierre bourdieu s concept of habitus particularly as articulated within distinction  a social critique of the judgment of taste  while injecting macro level socioeconomic concerns into the exploration of extreme endurance sports  the author concludes that investigations into the lived experience of participants must continue  but should be united with explorations into the connection between the phenomenology of play and its relationship to class and the changing economic structure  
 ethnic choice effects at the transition into upper secondary education in switzerland compared to natives  students with immigrant background are   other things being equal   more likely to choose academic tracks over vocational education and training  vet  at upper secondary level  evidence of so called ethnic choice effects is mostly based on education systems where vocational tracks are often regarded as unfavourable   our study investigated ethnic choice effects at the end of compulsory school in switzerland  a country with a strong vet sector offering competitive incentives  particularly for students with lower or average achievement  based on longitudinal data from the transitions from education to employment   tree  survey  we found that most migrant groups were more likely to choose academic track pathways preparing for university admission over vet preparing more directly for employment  nested logistic regression analyses revealed that a large share of these ethnic choice effects was explained by immigrant optimism  our findings shed light on general educational decision making processes among migrant families and their potential consequences for ethnic inequality in post compulsory education  
 ethnic diversity and health outcomes this study hypothesizes a relationship between ethnic diversity and health outcomes  we explore the effects of ethnic and linguistic heterogeneity  measured by indices of ethnic and linguistic fractionalization  on various health outcomes in a cross section of 91 countries  we explore outcomes relating to four major categories of health   1  immunization rates   2  prevalence of diseases   3  life expectancy and mortality rates  and  4  health related infrastructure and staff  across all dimensions examined  evidence suggests that higher heterogeneity is bad for health outcomes  we explore several potential mechanisms which could explain the observed negative effects of ethnic and linguistic diversity on health  
 ethnic minorities in northern mountains of vietnam  employment  poverty and income this study provides estimates of key socio economic indicators reflecting employment  poverty  and welfare of ethnic minorities in northern mountains of vietnam  the ethnic minorities in northern mountains have much lower assets and income than ethnic minorities in other regions  their income is mainly from crops and livestock  compared with kinh hoa  ethnic majorities  and ethnic minorities in other regions  ethnic minorities in the study area have substantially lower income from wage and non farm employment  by decomposing the income gap between the ethnic minorities in northern mountains and those in other region  this study provides the first evidence that the income gap between the two groups is mainly explained by the gap in wage and nonfarm incomes  northern mountain ethnic minorities spend less time on wage and nonfarm employment  their non farm income per working hours and farm income per working hours are substantially lower than those of other households  
 ethnicity and effectively maintained inequality in bc universities as canadian postsecondary systems have expanded they have become more institutionally differentiated  in british columbia  distinctions are made between research intensive universities  rius  and teaching intensive universities with respect to resources  programming  and perceived prestige value  we employ an effectively maintained inequality framework to examine the role played by ethnicity in the competition for admission to rius  our findings indicate that  together with socioeconomic status and gender  ethnicity is significantly related to riu attendance rates  ethnic group differences were particularly markedchinese and korean speakers being most likely and tagalog speakers least likely to attend an riu  high school grade point averages and english language proficiency scores moderated only some of these differences  raising questions about the efficacy of competitive admissions policies based solely on academic merit  
 ethno nationalist populism and the mobilization of collective resentment scholarly and journalistic accounts of the recent successes of radical right politics in europe and the united states  including the brexit referendum and the trump campaign  tend to conflate three phenomena  populism  ethno nationalism and authoritarianism  while all three are important elements of the radical right  they are neither coterminous nor limited to the right  the resulting lack of analytical clarity has hindered accounts of the causes and consequences of ethno nationalist populism  to address this problem  i bring together existing research on nationalism  populism and authoritarianism in contemporary democracies to precisely define these concepts and examine temporal patterns in their supply and demand  that is  politicians  discursive strategies and the corresponding public attitudes  based on the available evidence  i conclude that both the supply and demand sides of radical politics have been relatively stable over time  which suggests that in order to understand public support for radical politics  scholars should instead focus on the increased resonance between pre existing attitudes and discursive frames  drawing on recent research in cultural sociology  i argue that resonance is not only a function of the congruence between a frame and the beliefs of its audience  but also of shifting context  in the case of radical right politics  a variety of social changes have engendered a sense of collective status threat among national ethnocultural majorities  political and media discourse has channelled such threats into resentments toward elites  immigrants  and ethnic  racial and religious minorities  thereby activating previously latent attitudes and lending legitimacy to radical political campaigns that promise to return power and status to their aggrieved supporters  not only does this form of politics threaten democratic institutions and inter group relations  but it also has the potential to alter the contours of mainstream public discourse  thereby creating the conditions of possibility for future successes of populist  nationalist  and authoritarian politics  
 ethnomethodological indifference  just a passing phase  this paper examines whether social workers and other direct service practitioners can find utility in ethnomethodology despite or even because of the policy of  indifference   garfinkel  the father of ethnomethodology  em   sets out  ethnomethodological indifference   em i  to insist that em studies do not supplement  formulate remedies  develop humanistic arguments  or encourage discussions of theory  while at first blush such limits on em might appear to be a barrier for most social workers this paper argues against first impressions  it is argued that em provides an important redirection for social work practice and research  additionally  it is proposed that by approaching em through dorothy smith s institutional ethnography social workers can bridge garfinkel s quest for haeccities   just thisness  just here  just now   with extended social relations and actual courses of actions to find congruence between em and accomplished professional practice  
 european union regional policy and evaluation of turkey s harmonisation the european union  eu   whose foundations were laid with the treaty of rome in 1957  enabled the regional development of the member nations  the union was generally aimed at attaining prosperity  and the eu regional policy was developed to achieve this aim  since establishment  the union gradually expanded to 28 members  in each expansion  regions were added which were economically and socially undeveloped  and these differences between the dynamics of each region gradually caused regional policies to be revised and reformed  the regional policy includes not only member states  but nations which are candidates for membership are also included  it is thought that candidate nations can more easily achieve conformity with the eu by solving their problems of regional difference at a national level  turkey s 2005 candidate country status has been made official  and work has begun on achieving conformity with the eu  work carried out on chapter 22  the regional policy and coordination of structural instruments  is monitored on a yearly basis by eu progress reports  and it has been found that work on the chapters covered by the progress reports is inadequate  in this study  work conducted on regional policy in the eu is summarized  work being carried out by countries which are candidates for membership is explained in the form of examples  work conducted in turkey as part of eu conformity work is discussed  and the effectiveness of work carried out is evaluated in line with the target indicators defined under the eu s 2020 strategy  
 everyday violence in central america as seen through the life of one woman everyday violence in central america assumes diverse forms  with the structural violence intrinsic to the poverty and inequality in the region being the most predominant  the life story of andrea embodies many elements of that violence  as it led to her entering the labor force as a child  to her having her own children early  and to her employment in the service sector  but  andrea came of age during a revolution in her country that waged by the sandinistas in the 1980s which provided her family with resources of both a material and non material nature  the changes it wrought  however  were not deep enough to transform the opportunities of the next generation and were undercut in its aftermath  hence  andrea s aspiration for her children to have different lives from her own required her emigration to achieve it  yet  it was also the revolution  in the form of a network that emerged from it  that made possible her work abroad in italy  she was able to earn enough there to provide the education for her children that she sought  drawing on an oral history i collected from andrea  this article portrays the challenges she confronted  the ways she addressed them  and how her life course has been produced by the interaction between these phenomena  in addition to telling her story and describing the ways in which structural violence colored it  the article highlights the broader social  economic  and political dynamics that make this about more than just one woman  
 evidence triangulation in health research the combination of experimental  descriptive and content analytical approaches the contribution starts with weaknesses of a strict quantitative methodology in social research  especially in health research variable connections are so complex that a broader understanding of research methods seems to be necessary  the dominance of quantitative experimental ongoing in the sense of randomized controlled trials  rct  at the top of the evidence hierarchy is criticized and a concept of evidence triangulation in the sense of mixed methods is proposed as alternative  an example study shows the logic of this research design  an institution of drug addicts counseling and therapy is analyzed in its effects through an evaluation study  using four different methodological approaches  an experimental pre post design  qualitative interviews with the clients  and qualitative and document analysis using qualitative content analysis are combined  each of them is developed in criticizing and supplementing the other approaches  the mixed methods procedure therefor follows a dialectical theory of science  
 evolution and determinants of language attitudes among catalan adolescents this paper analyzes language integration from an intergroup relations  perspective  using the social identity approach and socio contextual model of second language acquisition  it focuses on the evolution of language attitudes in adolescents as an indicator of cultural integration between the two major language groups in catalonia  the distinctive features of the catalan case the similar ethnolinguistic vitality enjoyed by the two official languages and the widespread bilingualism that common schooling has fostered make it of great sociolinguistic interest  the empirical study focuses on the development of language attitudes towards catalan and spanish by using a panel sample of catalan students  n   1050  followed for a period of five years  three waves   joint trajectory clustering was used to make a longitudinal analysis that shows the main patterns of coevolution  logistic regression relates changes to other linguistic  identity and sociodemographic variables  results show that there are three main types of change in attitudes  a majority one  whith a profile of integration  and two others  which tend to separation  the direct effects of language confidence and ethnonational identity are found to explain the likelihood of individuals following one of these types of change  
 examining the emergence of large scale structures in collaboration networks  methods in sociological analysis this article introduces a number of methods that can be useful for examining the emergence of large scale structures in collaboration networks  the study contributes to sociological research by investigating how clusters of research collaborators evolve and sometimes percolate in a collaboration network  typically  we find that in our networks  one cluster among the leading ones eventually wins the growth race by percolating through the network  spanning it and rapidly filling up a significant volume of it  we show how this process is governed by the dynamics of cluster growth in the network  when operating in a percolating regime  this class of networks possesses many useful functional properties  which have important sociological implications  we first develop the methodological tools to perform a study of the intrinsic clustering process  then  to understand the actual large scale structure formation process in the network  we apply the theoretical methods to simulate a number of realistic scenarios  including one based on actual data on the collaboration behavior of a sample of researchers  from the perspective of social science research  our methods can be adapted to suit the application domains of many other types of real social processes  
 excessive celebration  the racialization of recruiting commitments on college football internet message boards the current study analyzed comments posted on internet message boards devoted to u s  college football  the investigators collected comments  n 3 800  about instances in which a player initially announced intent to attend a particular university  but later changed his mind and signed a national letter of intent to attend a different university  while few posts included explicit mention of race  n   11   commenters more frequently used forms of  color blind  racial rhetoric that invoked racialized meanings without the overt use of racial teems  n   346   comments often reflected a white colonial framing of football players  decisions  behaviors  and abilities  expressing a number of common racialized assumptions  including beliefs in the natural superiority of black physicality  doubts about black intellectual ability  and expectations about whites possessing skill  technique  and mental capacity  the presence of these racialized assumptions points to the continued salience of race in an era that is often claimed to be  color blind  and free of racial discrimination  
 exclusions in inclusive programs  state sponsored sustainable development initiatives amongst the kurichya in kerala  india we critically discuss the impact of sustainable development initiatives in kerala  india  on biodiversity and on women farmers in the matrilineal adivasi community of the kurichya tribe in wayanad  by contextualizing development programs regarding the specifically gendered access to land  division of labor  distribution of knowledge and decision making power  we situate our analysis within the theoretical framework of feminist political ecology  we first outline women s gaining of social and political space in local self government institutions  panchayath  and then critically discuss the impacts of women s farming groups  joint liability groups  jlgs   decentralization and development programs have aimed at empowering women and reducing poverty through improved food security  however  little success has materialized  as patriarchal power structures concerning decision making processes as well as control over the most valuable resources  land and rice  and traditional knowledge have been maintained  whereas women s self help groups  kudumbasree  in kerala have enhanced their position  women s farming groups  jlgs   by contrast  have brought little betterment  in some cases they have even downsized women s management and knowledge of resources related to agriculture and do not integrate or enhance kurichya women s knowledge  as some women are now introducing high yielding rice seeds and fertilizer and as it is impossible for them to control land and get access to traditional rice seeds the domain of men we contest the notion of women being considered the preservers of agrobiodiversity  we argue  rather  that the construction and transformation of ecological traditional knowledge is highly dependent on the gendered multi scaled power structures of state and community  
 exit tales  how precarious workers navigate bad jobs why do some workers quit undignified bad jobs  while others persist in them  we know a great deal about how people find employment  along with what they do at work  but we have few studies documenting the lived experience of quitting a bad job  recent structural transformations  such as the demise of fordism and the curtailment of welfare  have surely recalibrated the strategies by which precarious individuals navigate the labor market  this article  an ethnography that follows a single cohort of call center employees over nine months  documents four main pathways through which such workers leave versus stay in their jobs  it argues that the emergent class of precarious workers is not homogenous  gender  race  and age intersect with class to shape how one experiences a given bad job  
 exoticism as a mediator of everyday experiences of nature  an anthropological exploration of soundscape in zoos the increasing levels of stress entailed by contemporary urban lifestyles can lead to a greater desire to escape from cities  the restorative sense of  being away  produced by natural environments has been substantially explored in greenspaces but little studied in zoos  which endeavour to immerse visitors in a local or exotic environment through both the visual environment and soundscape  we explore how soundscapes contribute to this sense of immersion through self reflective interviews with 20 participants in two zoos in paris  france   the zoo was perceived as a natural or a socially crowded area depending on the auditory context  interestingly  focusing on the captive exotic animals seemed to make participants more aware of the more common birds around them in the zoo  by highlighting both  zoos could potentially increase awareness and care for urban biodiversity  
 experiencing discrimination in los angeles  latinos at the intersection of legal status and socioeconomic status despite its recent slowdown  immigration from latin america continues to be a controversial issue  some scholars argue that the social climate is increasingly inhospitable to latinos  potentially fueling discriminatory attitudes and behaviors  however  little research has examined latinos  experiences with discrimination  especially variation by nativity and legal status  we address this issue with research on perceived discrimination among mexican and central american residents of los angeles county  a major destination for latin american immigrants  using data from the los angeles family and neighborhood survey and the american community survey  the analyses consider immigrants  legal status  intersectionality  and competing perspectives on assimilation  the results show that undocumented immigrants do not report especially high levels of discrimination  instead  young u s  born latinos are the most likely to report mistreatment in interpersonal and institutional domains  neighborhood ethnoracial and income diversity also have implications for perceived exposure to different types of discrimination   c  2017 elsevier inc  all rights reserved  
 expert for a day  theory and the tailored craft of ethnography sociologists exhibit growing interest in the politics of expertise  analyses of evaluations  economic paradigms  blueprints  censuses  policy instruments and the like have come to occupy an important position in recent research  while much of this emergent scholarship has drawn on historical methods  a growing number of scholars have turned to ethnography  a close reading of this work reveals that ethnographers have actively tailored rather than passively transposed ethnography to the study of expertise  departing from traditional conceptions of ethnography  these works exhibit growing attentiveness to movement  mediation  and materials  we argue that this retooling of ethnography is not merely a response to empirical realities but rather stems  at least in part  from the influence of science and technology studies  specifically actor network theory  this case provides the occasion to make a broader point about ethnography as a theory method package   theory does not only shape what ethnographers study  but also how they conduct research  
 explaining accessibility and satisfaction related to healthcare  a mixed methods approach accessibility and satisfaction related to healthcare services are conceived as multidimensional concepts  these concepts can be studied using objective and subjective measures  in this study  we created two indices  a composite healthcare accessibility index  chca  and a composite healthcare satisfaction index  chcs   to calculate the chca index we used three indicators based on three components of multidimensional healthcare accessibility  availability  acceptability and accessibility  in the indicator based on the component of accessibility  we included an innovative perceived time decay parameter  the three indicators of the chca index were weighted through the application of a principal components analysis  to calculate the chcs index  we used three indicators  the waiting time after the patient arrives at the healthcare service  the quality of the healthcare  and the healthcare service supply  these three indicators making up the chca index were weighted by applying an analytical hierarchy process  three kinds of regressions were subsequently applied in order to explain the chca and chcs indices  namely the linear least squares  ordinal logistic  and random forests regressions  in these regressions  we used different independent social and health related variables  these variables represented the predisposing  enabling  and need factors of peoplea   s behaviors related to healthcare  all the calculations were applied to a study area  the city of quito  ecuador  results showed that there are health related inequalities in regard to healthcare accessibility and healthcare satisfaction in our study area  we also identified specific social factors that explained the indices developed  the present work is a mixed methods approach to evaluate multidimensional healthcare accessibility and healthcare satisfaction  incorporating a pluralistic perspective  as well as a multidisciplinary framework  the results obtained can also be considered as tools for healthcare and urban planners  for more integrative social analyses that can improve the quality of life in urban residents  
 explaining age differences in positive attitudes towards national commemorations  the role of what people commemorate commemorations of shared national history are important to the process of nation building  support for such national commemorations is not  however  evenly distributed in societies  because this could endanger the possible integrative function of commemorative ceremonies  it is important to understand the sources of structural differences in support  in this article  age differences in support for national commemorations in the netherlands are examined  it is argued that because age cohorts grow up with different ideas on what should be commemorated they also differ in value attached to such commemorations  data from the national freedom enquiry 2012 show that older persons more often associate national commemorations with the second world war than younger persons do  and that this is the reason why they are more supportive of the annual celebration of liberation day  in the concluding section  it is argued that more  quantitative  studies should be conducted in order to truly understand the mechanisms behind support of national commemorations as this may help us to better comprehend the processes construing feelings of national belonging  
 explaining differences in the salience of religion as a symbolic boundary of national belonging in europe this article analyses how differences in the salience of religion as a symbolic boundary of the nation among the majority populations in europe can be explained  following previous studies  i consider individual  and country level characteristics based on theories of social identity and ethnic threat in my analyses to explain the variation  in addition  i include the institutional relationship between church and state and historical manifestations of religious nationalism as additional context conditions  which i assume to influence the salience of religious boundaries among the population  drawing on data from the international social survey programme  multilevel regression models are applied to data from 28 european countries  the results reveal that affiliation with the dominant religion as well as individual religiosity and perceived ethnic threat influences whether the national community is defined in religious terms  at the country level  historical manifestations of religious nationalism and a close and supportive relation between the state and dominant church increase the salience of religious boundaries of the nation  even when controlling for different levels of secularization  thus  cultural narratives and institutional settings constitute important frameworks that impact individual definitions of national belonging in times of growing religious diversity and struggles over immigrant integration  
 explanatory typologies as a nested strategy of inquiry  combining cross case and within case analyses explanatory typologies have recently experienced a renaissance as a research strategy for constructing and assessing causal explanations  however  both the new methodological works on explanatory typologies and the way such typologies have been used in practice have been affected by two shortcomings  first  no elaborate procedures for assessing the general explanatory power of a typological theory on the cross case level have been devised  second  rigorous selection procedures for within case analysis are lacking  against this background  we introduce a systematic measure that helps researchers assess the explanatory power on the cross case level  first  within the scope set by a particular typological theory and  second  by investigating the transferability of the theory beyond these scope conditions via an increase in the number of cases  drawing on recent methodological works on nested analysis  we show how researchers can identify key cases for process tracing based on the cross case explanatory fit of the typological theory  we illustrate the purchase of our procedures by revisiting seminal studies from the field of comparative historical analysis  
 exploring multidimensional well being in switzerland  comparing three synthesizing approaches well being is increasingly conceptualized and measured from a multidimensional perspective in order to provide policy makers and the general public with the necessary tools for monitoring social change  synthetic measures of multidimensional concepts such as well being are  therefore  needed  this paper provides a systematic comparison of three methodological approaches applicable in a top down perspective to construct a synthetic multidimensional measure of well being using the same theoretical framework and the same data  the three methodologies used are the confirmatory factor analysis  the alkire and foster counting approach and the posetic approach  the first two methodologies belong to the family of composite indicators  the most common way to synthetize multidimensional information  the third was developed in order to deal with the construction of composite indicators  two major issues  namely weighting and aggregating  the main contribution of this paper is methodological  it aims at discussing the advantages and drawbacks of the three methodologies  and at identifying their similarities and specificities  
 exploring tensions in knowledge networks  convergences and divergences from social capital  actor network theory and sociologies of the south knowledge networks have been discussed as mechanisms that facilitate access to resources and information  they are noted as organizations that promote the generation of new contacts and interactions between actors in order to produce knowledge that increases the speed and reliability of communication  they are also understood as platforms that encourage learning and knowledge coordination in order to advance technoscientific innovation processes  despite these benefits  knowledge networks can engender areas of tension  the article examines the tensions in knowledge networks by analysing the theoretical convergences and divergences between social capital insights  actor network theory and several contributions from the sociologies of the south  the following four categories are discussed   1  hierarchy production   2  blockages to the access to resources   3  the spatialization of networks  and  4  the different ways of understanding power  the latter offer opportunities to make the tensions in knowledge networks visible  the article proposes initiating a discussion focused on the dynamic movement of asymmetries to analyse knowledge networks between the global north and the global south as entities that are in a process of constant negotiation  
 exploring the double edged sword of cultural variability in interactions with family versus friends cultural variability  cv  refers to the tendency to vary adjust the influence of a single cultural identity on one s social interactions and behaviors from day to day  cv has different influences on interpersonal interactions  positive for some interactions but with adverse effects for others  hence  we aimed to further explore these associations by considering immigrant status and ethnic orientation as potential moderators  hierarchical regression using daily diary self reports of u s  emerging adults  n   242  revealed that cultural variability is a double edged sword only for first  and second generation immigrants rather than for nationals  3rd generation and later   that is  cv predicts positive family interactions for both groups  but negative interactions with dose friends only for immigrants  especially those with strong ethnic orientation  cultural variability adds a new dimension to our understanding of cultural identity as dynamic  domain specific  and nuanced in its associations with adaptation  
 exploring the eligibility criteria of the child support grant and its impact on poverty one of the most important policy objectives in the post apartheid south african economy is to reduce poverty  although economic growth and job creation are the preferred sources of alleviating poverty and inequality  social grant spending has contributed significantly to reduce poverty  van der berg et al  in poverty trends since the transition  what we know  stellenbosch economic working papers  19 09  stellenbosch  stellenbosch university  2009   recently proposals were tabled by the department of social development of south africa  fin24 in r3 3bn plan to extend child support grant to 21  http   www fin24 com economy r33bn child care grant extension to 21 on cards 20150316  accessed august 7  2015  2015  to extend the age eligibility of the child support grant  csg  to 21 years  at the time of writing children aged up to 18 years are eligible   this sparked an interest to investigate the impact on poverty of changes to the eligibility criteria of csg  as well as its fiscal implications  using person and household data from the 2010 2011 income and expenditure survey  various simulations are performed to assess the impact on poverty rates and changes to social spending  given the following changes   1  if all age eligible children applied   2  if all beneficiaries received the grant amount for the full 12 month duration   3  if the age eligibility criterion is extended  and  4  if the monthly child grant income amount is revised upwards  we also examine how changes in the eligibility criteria affect the income distribution  
 exploring the ineffable in women s experiences of relationality with their stored ivf embryos this article contributes to a more nuanced and contextual approach to women s decision making concerning their stored ivf  in vitro fertilisation  embryos through attempting to craft a space for the expression of the complex  and contradictory  emotions attached to these decisions  unhooked from any notion of abstract moral status inhering in the embryo itself  women struggle to express the confounding nature of the relationship to the stored ivf embryo as something of the body but not within the body  neither self nor other  person nor thing  in order to try to address this sense of the ineffable  i draw in this article upon a series of images by german born american artist  kiki smith  the article explores three major themes  each alongside one of smith s artworks connecting to an experience of discomfort or confounding unease  
 exploring the length and complexity of couples travel decision making a quasi experiment is used to examine the dynamics of the shared decision making process by observing couples in real time as they make decisions about an overnight stay at a luxury resort  observations and video recordings of the decision processes of 24 couples were coded and analyzed  the time to final decision  number  and type of tactics used were found to vary with couples  length of experience with one another  observation indicated that couples with greater travel experience together relied on predealing based on their experience together to avoid conflict  while less experienced couples  decisions were more likely to yield winners and losers  these findings and those related to the use of persuasive tactics by members of the couple dyads provide the basis for specific recommendations for marketing travel products  
 extranational spaces and the disruption of national boundaries  turkish immigrant media and claims against the state in 1980s west germany after the 1980 coup that shook turkey and almost twenty years after the bilateral guest worker  treaty shifted germany s demographic make up  west german policy makers proposed increasingly restrictive regulations on the guest workers  who had heavily contributed to west germany s economy  in this crucial historical moment  turkish language newspapers  published in west germany  created a politically motivated extranational public sphere in which they launched claims against both the west german and turkish states  these claims shaped immigration and integration policy between the two countries  fostered diasporic activism and cross national religious and political organisations and gave rise to a variety of unexpected organisational outcomes that continue to impact both germany and the turkish republic  
 eyes of the law  a visual turn in socio legal studies  a number of sub disciplines have emerged in recent years with the specific goal of examining the visual dynamics of academic fields of inquiry  the turn to the visual masks a multitude of meanings about the significance of the image  ranging from new ways of defining a field of inquiry  to what constitutes legitimate sources for research or discussions of image production or visual prompts as a data collection method  this article asks what it means for socio legal scholars to engage with the image and the opportunity it might provide us with to see what law looks like from the perspective of law s subjects  these might include art installations in galleries  images of the places where justice is administered as well as photographs created by those who are subjected to legal regulation  in addition to a written essay i offer up three visual essays which can be read and contemplated with or without the written text which accompanies them  
 failed legacies of colonial linguistics  lessons from tamil books in french india and french guiana the archives of french india and french guiana  two colonies that were failing by the mid nineteenth century  elucidate the legacy of colonial linguistics by drawing attention to the ideological and technological natures of colonial printing and the far reaching and longstanding consequences of the european objectification of indian vernaculars  torn between religious  commercial  and imperialist agendas  the french in india both promoted catholicism and advanced the scientific study of tamil  the majority language spoken in the colonial headquarters of pondicherry  there  a little known press operated by the paris foreign missions shipped seventy one dictionaries  grammars  and theological works printed in tamil and french to catholic schools undergoing secularization in french guiana  a colony with several thousand tamil indentured laborers  i analyze the books  lexical  orthographic  and typographical forms  metalinguistic commentaries  publicity tactics  citational practices  and circulation histories by drawing on seldom discussed materials from the archives nationales d outre mer in aix en provence  france  i propose a theoretical framework to investigate how technology intersects with the historical relationship between language and colonialism  and argue that printing rivalries contributed to orientalist knowledge production by institutionalizing semiotic and language ideologies about the nature of perfectible and erroneous signs  my comparative approach highlights the interdiscursive features of different genres and historical periods of tamil documentation  and underscores how texts that emerged out of disparate religious and scientific movements questioned the veracity of knowledge and fidelity of sources  such metalinguistic labor exposed the evolving stances of french indologists toward dravidian and indo aryan linguistics and promoted religious and secular interests in educational and immigration policies  
 falling into a routine  from habits to situated practices in line with the concept of nudging  people to change their behaviour  there has been increased attention on habit as a focus for psychologically based health interventions  it is hoped that behaviours initiated by interventions not only become so regular that they are normalised into people s everyday lives  but that through repetition they may eventually become fixed and habitual  in this paper we draw on people s accounts of participating in a trial designed to encourage greater physical activity  and attend to the ways they describe their engagement with interventions within wider narratives of their everyday lives  in contrast to the idea that habit refers to automatic behaviour cued by external stimuli and governed by unconscious cognitive processes  our study describes how people identify many diverse elements that are felt to have equal significance in achieving a routine  paradoxically  the sense of stability derives not from exact repetition  but from the ability for an assemblage of elements to be configured slightly differently each time  we consequently argue that attending to the diverse range of contextual elements bracketed off from interventions designed to be tested in trials  and the idea that continuity might emerge from variation  demands a reconceptualisation of the concept of habit adopted within many areas of current health psychology  
 familiarity as a tool of populism  political appropriation of shared experiences and the case of suvivirsi populist argumentation claims to represent the people  against the elite   appealing to emotions and reacting to a sense of crisis  by analysing a public debate in finland in which populist arguments appropriate a culturally shared  familiar experience   that of singing suvivirsi  the summer hymn   i argue that evoking familiarity is an effective way of doing populism   analysing media texts from 2002 to 2014 and a questionnaire to political candidates in 2011  and using laurent thevenot s sociology of engagements  the article shows that appeals to the familiarity of the hymn are particularly compatible with the populist valorization of the experience of the common people  familiarity thus constitutes a central tool in the toolkit of populism  remembering the shared experience of singing the hymn bonds the assumed people  together and gives an emotional charge to populist arguments  by drawing on pragmatist political sociology and analysing politics in action  in everyday disputes  the paper makes a novel contribution to the scholarship of populism  
 family  law  assemblages  new modes of being  legal  this article advances a new model for family law to address emerging non conventional family formations  particularly between parents and children  we contend that the conventional model of kinship categories as static  predefined statuses should be replaced with a model whereby the state accommodates kinship categories the law users themselves produce within their fluid and nomadic family assemblages and that they actively revise when negotiating state recognition  we claim that this model would better reflect and govern the emerging kinship system  we corroborate this by drawing on insights from family research that takes issue with the fragmentation of kinship  particularly the fragmentation of motherhood  we then elaborate on a conception of state recognition as the capacity to trace connections and identify normative frameworks  one that valorizes the self organizing force of social practices but at the same time holds onto the filtering role of the state  
 family economy  rural school choice  and flexischooling children with disabilities most homeschooled students would be more accurately described as flexischooled  partly homeschooled and partly enrolled in school  the popularity of these two alternatives to public or private school enrollment has increased over the past several decades to the extent that  by 2012 over 2 million students  4 percent of the population  were either flexischooled or homeschooled in the united states  to understand why parents have pursued these options over enrollment  we employed a family economy perspective  arguing that family  child  and locational considerations shaped parents  motivations for homeschooling or flexischooling over enrollment  for example  parents  decisions were partially shaped by the interaction between children s disability status and rural location  using data from the national household education survey 2012  this article first describes the prevalence of flexischooling and full time homeschooling  then  it demonstrates how various family  child  and locational factors shape the odds of flexischooling and homeschooling  and then examines the interaction between location and children s disability status in detail  we discuss the implications of our findings for family economy theoretical perspectives  flexischooling  and rural education research  
 father figures and cultural diversity in france who are the father figures or cultural role models for paternal involvement in france today  in this article  we examine changes in the cultural models of father involvement or father figures from a framework of family sociology and in light of the move from male breadwinner models to dual earner families  first  we note the persistence of a neopatriarchal father figure in some specific groups of society  in particular large families who practice their religion actively  however  this father figure is declining under the pressures of mass unemployment  a rise in female employment activity  and an increase in marital separations  at the same time  sociologists highlight the increase in preoccupation with the concept of failing fathers  there is normative alarm about failing fatherhood among early childhood professionals interviewed for this study  alternatively  we see the emergence of a new range of father involvement figures  especially among the intellectual middle classes and among some immigrants  where tasks are shared equally and with little gender differentiation within the home  one where fathers shake up or even overturn gender roles  whether in a gay or heterosexual couples  one where stepfathers are committed fully to their educational role  our study shows that these three phenomena of neopatriarchal fathers  failing fathers  and new fathers exist side by side and reflect three eras of male female relationships in french public policies  familialism  feminism  and parentalism  
 fauna  fire  and farming  landscape formation over the past 200 years in pastoral east pokot  kenya fire was a key element of grass savanna formation all over eastern africa  in the northern baringo plains  pokot pastoralists prospered in the nineteenth century  coexisting with huge herds of wildlife  during the twentieth century  the savanna ecosystem changed from a grass dominated to bush dominated as a result of growing numbers of livestock and people  which brought not only elephant hunts but also intensive grazing and changing fire regimes  subsequently  herders diversified their livelihoods  and these land use changes in the east pokot highlands led to the spread of the endemic plant dodonaea viscosa  sapindaceae  beyond its original habitat  ingolds  concept of taskscape is applied here to illustrate a temporal  consecutive perspective of landscape transitions against the background of disappearing landscape agents  in this case large herbivores and fire

 feminization of sport audiences and fans  evidence from the german men s national soccer team sport and sport consumption represent highly gendered spheres  accordingly  sport spectatorship and fandom have been predominantly male  recently  however  a trend towards a  feminization of sport crowds  within european soccer has been detected  the piece of research presented here focuses on the concept s quantitative dimension and aims to provide empirical evidence on long term trends in female sport consumption and team identification studying trends for the german national soccer team over a 12 year period  the results suggest that the feminization of soccer reflects not only inauthentic consumerism but also increased team identification  moreover  consistent age effects might be interpreted as indicating that the detected trends relate to changes in gender roles attitudes  
 fertility and financial development in south asia the paper empirically examines old age security hypothesis to explain fertility rates in south asia  panel data is used for the period 1972 2013 for seven south asian countries which include bangladesh  bhutan  india  maldives  nepal  pakistan and sri lanka  the estimated results reveal that in south asia fertility rate decreases with the increase in financial development  thus  the findings support old age security hypothesis that parents use children as financial instruments to secure their old age  this paper validates the theory that the availability of alternative financial tools reduces the incentives of households to have large offspring  infant mortality is also shown an important factor for high fertility rate in south asia  this implies that households cover their risk from losing children by producing more children  the results also reveal that fertility rate decreases with the increase in per capita income  which implies that households treat children as inferior good in this region  in other words  households prefer quality of children over quantity of children when their income level increases  the results have also shown that fertility decreases with the increase in education  urbanization  agriculture productivity and industrialization  the study has some important policy implications  
 fields of mutual alignment  a dual order approach to the study of cultural holes in this article  i discuss how network analytic exploitations of the duality of agents and social object enable the study of fields from two analytical vantage points  such an approach entails   1  the discovery of field positions through identification of cultural holes within a network of agents  tastes and  2  the measurement of interobject competition to identify social objects contributing most to the organization of field positions  characterizing this approach as a mutual alignment framework  i discuss its analytical advantages  at the level of the agent  i suggest that positions within fields retrieve their value by virtue of their relational style  or their relationship to the field s cultural holes  at the level of the social object  i provide an analytical framework for identifying structurally important social objects through relationships of asymmetrical competition and incommensurability  or a lack of substitutability  i provide an empirical application to a population of film critics  
 finding tools to limit sectarian violence in indonesia  the relevance of restorative justice this article explores the relevance of the restorative justice paradigm to issues of conflict avoidance and resolution in indonesia  sectarian violence engulfed indonesia in the late 1990s after the fall of the new order  largely as a result of resource competition and other economic factors  in addition  the revival of customary forms of authority through the national indigenous peoples movement exacerbated the potential for conflict between long settled indigenes and more recent migrants  a case study shows how the spread of communal conflict to the lindu plain in central sulawesi was averted despite the sectarian violence in a nearby city  local customary procedures of adjudication were insufficient to cope with such issues in a multiethnic context  as the ethnic groups in the area did not all subscribe to the same body of custom  adat   instead  a diverse assembly of stakeholders invoked nationalist idioms of harmony and consensus to forge an agreement to avoid violence  previous legal theorists have pointed to adat as a preexisting respository of restorative justice practices  however  this article argues that interethnic contexts require restorative practice to forge novel syntheses to deal with communal violence  such syntheses may incorporate adat mechanisms  but they must also integrate other tools that gain the allegiance of multiple groups to work toward reconciliation and avoidance of further violence

 football and the military in contemporary britain  an exploration of invisible nationalism this article examines the relationship between football  soccer  and the military in britain to explore how  invisible nationalism  has evolved  here  invisible nationalism refers to the phenomena by which the presence of the military at major british sporting events is both highly visual and has been rendered culturally and politically invisible  it is hidden  in plain sight   we applied the conceptual framework associated with the  annales  school of structuralist history to explore how the inextricable links between football  the military  the monarchy  and established church have influenced the evolution of invisible nationalism  we conducted ethnographic fieldwork  including observations  interviews  and focus groups  and also analyzed visual data  these comprised television broadcasts of national sporting events and figures taken at english football clubs  we conclude that the power of the dominant metanarratives of british nationalism serves to render these phenomena invisible to most spectators  especially those who consume football via television

 forced migration and changing livelihoods in the brazilian amazon forced migration due to development projects or environmental change impacts livelihoods  as affected households are faced with newand often less favorableenvironmental  social  and economic conditions  this article examines changing livelihood strategies among a population of rural agricultural households displaced by the belo monte dam in the brazilian amazon  using longitudinal data  i find that many households used compensation payments to concentrate income generation efforts on the most lucrative strategiescacao and cattle production and business or rental income  poorer households and those that received the least compensation were more likely to continue relying on agricultural wage labora less desirable income source associated with not owning land or with persons needing to supplement income with additional work as a day laborer  results also indicate that the amount of compensation received by most households was sufficient to enable them to make productive investments beyond attaining replacement land and housing  many households invested in assets such as agricultural infrastructure  cattle  rental houses  or tractorsall of which directly contribute to future income  displacement compensation  similar to remittances or conditional cash transfers  can therefore act as an important infusion of capital to promote socioeconomic development and poverty reduction  
 formal and informal relations to rice seed systems in kerala  india  agrobiodiversity as a gendered social ecological artifact agrobiodiversity is an evident outcome of a long lasting human nature relationship  as the continuous use  conservation and management of crops has resulted in biological as well as cultural diversity of seeds and breeds  this paper aims to understand the interlocking of formal and informal seed supply routes by considering the dynamic flow of seeds within networks across the intersections of gender  ethnicity and age in south india as social categories structuring human nature relations  this changing relationship under formal and informal institutional settings has consequences on performance for men and women in rice seed systems  undertaking an empirical analysis of the organization of seed management and exchange  we seek to shed light on the gendered organization of agrobiodiversity as a social network  the study builds on net map interviews conducted in 2012  embedded in the larger biodiva project in the district of wayanad in kerala  india  based on network analysis  the interactive method employed has enabled identification of important actors in the seed system and the characteristics of their relationships  we look into the gendered structure of information exchange regarding seed varieties and actual seed transactions  while also examining clusters of actors collaborating regarding seed supply  finally  we identify the institutional gap concerning seed sources left by formal and informal institutions  like the availability of varieties  we show how informal and formal seed systems coexist and overlap due to actors moving between systems and argue that the degree and areas of overlap are shaped by gendered human nature relations  
 fostering equality of opportunity  compulsory schooling reform and social mobility in germany there is an ongoing debate in the field of social mobility research about whether intergenerational social mobility can be increased by way of education policy  however  evidence on the effects of specific education policies on social mobility continues to be scarce  this article analyses the effect of one specific policy reform  the extension of compulsory schooling in germany  which has been argued to have led to a decrease in educational inequality and an increase in social mobility  using a difference in difference design  the article exploits the variation in the timing of the reform across german states to estimate the reform effect on the educational attainment and labour market chances of individuals from different social class backgrounds  we find that the reform resulted in a substantial narrowing of the gap in educational attainment between different social origin groups  this decline in educational inequality further translated into a reduction in the inequality in labour market chances between people from different social class backgrounds  thus increasing intergenerational social mobility  our findings suggest that educational policy can lead to substantial increases in intergenerational social mobility  which may have been overlooked in past research on societal level  long run trends in social mobility  
 frantz fanon s contribution to hegelian marxism although frantz fanon s work has been widely read and discussed in recent years  his contributions are often abstracted from its debt to marxist theory and hegelian philosophy  this paper seeks to correct this by re examining his approach to issues of recognition  identity  and self consciousness in black skin  white masks in light of contemporary issues of racism and ethnic identity  fanon departs from hegel in many respects  especially concerning his understanding of the nature of the  master slave  relations that are structured along racial lines  he also seeks to go beyond marx by providing a psycho affective as against a primarily economic analysis of exploitation and alienation  instead of representing a departure of the dialectical tradition  however  fanon s insights on these and other issues represent a crucial extension and concretization of it in light of the realities of his lived experience

 friends you can trust  a signaling theory of interest group litigation before the us supreme court how do interest groups influence u s  supreme court justices to vote in favor of their preferred outcomes  following prior research on the influence of the solicitor general  we develop and expand on the signaling theory of interest group influence via amicus curie briefs  we argue that an interest group s ideological reputation and the nature of the ideological signal it sends in its brief both function as powerful heuristics that convey information to the justices depending on the justices  own ideological preferences  when an organization files an amicus brief advocating for an outcome seemingly contrary to its traditional preferences  i e   an unexpected signal   this signal should be more noticeable and credible than a signal in accordance with a group s conventional views  i e   an expected signal   however  unexpected signals should have greater influence on justices who share the brief filer s preferences  we test our signaling theory on the terms from 1991 through 2002  we find that unexpected signals  but not expected signals  are associated with supreme court voting  and the influence of unexpected signals appears to be particularly strong among justices who share the ideological preferences of the brief filer

 from communist fan clubs to professional hooligans  a history of polish fandom as a social process the main aim of this article is to present the history of polish football fandom as a social process which has coincided with the processes of transformation of polish society over the last few decades  the fan movement in poland dates back to the early 1970s when the communist authorities attempted to channel the activity of supporters  the 1980s  however  brought the development of a spontaneous movement with strong accents of hooliganism  the post 1989 transformation led to an economic and social crisis  with the rule of anarchy in football stadiums  along with the formation of the democratic order  the fan movement evolved into different sections focused on particular aspects of activity  the paper is also devoted to the ideological dimension of fan culture  related to the conflict with the government at the turn of the 2010s  
 from consumer to construer  travels in human subjectivity a key component of how human beings organize their lives is how they perceive and make sense of what it means to be human  that is  their subjectivity  human subjectivity has taken on different dominant forms across history  the consumer being one of the most dominant contemporary forms  based on current and potential trends  we argue  with a deliberate tone of optimism about transformative potential of the human condition  that if the contemporary iconographic culture is transcended  there is the possibility of a subject that transcends the consumer  a construer subject  in contrast to what largely exists in extant literature   extrapolating from the consumer subjectivity to posthuman subjects   we envision the possibility of an epochal cultural change that will provide the ground for a construer subjectivity to emerge  we offer some preliminary insights into what such subjectivity may entail  
 from food security to food wellbeing  examining food security through the lens of food wellbeing in nepal s rapidly changing agrarian landscape this paper argues that existing food security and food sovereignty approaches are inadequate to fully understand contradictory human development  nutrition  and productivity trends in nepalese small scale agriculture  in an attempt to bridge this gap  we developed a new food wellbeing approach that combines insights from food security  food sovereignty  and social wellbeing perspectives  we used the approach to frame 65 semi structured interviews in a cluster of villages in kaski district in the mid hills of nepal on various aspects of food security  agriculture  off farm livelihood opportunities  and women s wellbeing  our results indicate that context specific subjective and social relational factors highlighted by the food wellbeing approach are key to understanding a paradox of increased food security  yet decreasing sustainability of small scale agriculture  increased levels of male out migration and opportunities for local off farm work have increased local capacity to purchase food  the positive consequences for food security are indicated by evidence that households with non farm income sources had better food sufficiency  absorption capacity  nutritional quality  and stability of food supply  these off farm employment opportunities have also led to the greater involvement of low caste groups and women in small scale agriculture  this has been empowering for both groups and led to an increase in wellbeing  particularly for those women who have become de facto heads of household  yet  small landholdings  persistent patterns of unequal and absentee land ownership  sharecropping  women s overwork  and the aspirations of low caste farmers and women away from agriculture are simultaneously driving the erosion of local small scale agricultural productivity and ecological sustainability  
 from interacting systems to a system of divisions  the concept of society and the  mutual constitution  of intersecting social divisions this article examines a fundamental theoretical aspect of the discourse on intersectionality  in feminist and anti racist social theory  namely  the question whether intersecting social divisions including those of sex  gender  race  class and sexuality are interacting but independent entities with autonomous ontological bases or whether they are different dimensions of the same social system that lack separate social ontologies and constitute each other  based on a historical reconstruction of its genesis  the article frames this as a dispute between system theoretical and dialectical  critical theory  related approaches and argues that the latter better capture the dynamics of contemporary society  including the perspective of its transcendence  
 from rau to sacred plants  transfigurations of shamanic agency among the siona indians of colombia translations of the native notion of shamanic agency of the siona indians of colombia is explored throughout different historical and social contexts  the polysemic concept rau is central to the shaman s capacity for establishing relations of exchange and negotiation with humans and non humans  as the embodiment of his power  it fits within a semantic field that conveys the waxing and waning of life cycles  sharing a series of qualities with the melanesian concept of mana  rau should be understood as a social phenomenon whose use and meaning has transfigured through time and space  however  unlike the globalization of new mana  the important notion of siona shamanic agency has been substituted by representations of the ritual substance of yaje as key symbol for power and knowledge as siona rituals have been revitalized in their dialogue with the ethnic identity movement and the neo shamanic network that associates sacred plants with primordial knowledge and agency  
 from sinks to webs  critical social science after the fact value distinction the fact value distinction is leaky  the problem is not just that values can color facts  the reverse is also true  facts are also entangled with values  nor is that the end of the matter  the concepts of fact and value are not epistemologically or ethically neutral either  it is time to abandon the quest for axiological neutrality in favor of systematic attention to the complex relationship between the descriptive and the normative  instead of attempting to be neutral  social scientists should strive to combine engagement with open mindedness  
 from state socialist to neoliberal productivism  disability policy and invalidation of disabled people in the postsocialist region this article criticizes the negative impact of productivism on disabled people of working age in the postsocialist region of central and eastern europe  productivism is conceptualized as a mechanism that generates cultural and material invalidation of those considered to be unable to work  the analysis begins by outlining some political economic features of state socialism that underpinned its productivism  emphasizing commodification of labor  it proceeds by discussing the ensuing approach to social policy  comparing it with two alternative models  afterwards  it highlights several ways in which productivism shaped disability policy in the countries of the former eastern bloc  finally  the analysis looks at present day disability policy in the postsocialist region  it is argued that after 1989  the state based productivism of the socialist regime was partially complemented and partially displaced by the market based productivism of the new neoliberal regime  the conclusion discusses strategies for resisting productivism  focusing specifically on decommodification of labor  
 funding sources  family income  and fields of study in college research shows that receiving loans  family contributions  and grants has implications for students both during and after college  but one key outcome has been overlooked  fields of study  using data from the national longitudinal survey of youth 1997 cohort  nlsy 97   this study is the first to assess how college funding is associated with first term majors and course selection throughout college  i posit that funding sources effectively constrain students  fields of study  such that students choose majors and courses that align with their broader financial circumstances  as funding from loans increases  students are more likely to major in applied non stem fields  e g   business  nursing  and less likely to be undeclared during the first term particularly if students are from low or middle income families  conversely  as funding from family contributions increases  students are more likely to be undeclared and less likely to major or take courses in applied non stem fields  receiving grants bears little relation to students  major or course fields  these patterns suggest that funding sources entail distinct costs and benefits that may influence college student decision making  and that fields of study are the product of multiple sources of inequality  
 gare a l ecart   de l importance du genre dans la religion  la spiritualite et la laicite en italie this article has a twofold aim  the first is to examine relations between women and religion in italy in order to discover whether women contribute to the process of italian secularisation as described in the literature  the second is to explore relations between secularisation and secularism among italian women  our main theme is that the women s loosening relationship with the catholic church has been accompanied by their greater flexibility on moral and ethical questions  since these questions have frequently been the object of intervention by the catholic hierarchy  they are a valuable lens through which to examine secularism  revealing how far italian women have distanced themselves from the church s mandates  with this end in view  we shall focus on italian women s opinions about topics  such as abortion  divorce  sexuality and reproductive rights  relating to morality politics which are intrinsic to the emancipation of women from the domestic sphere  
 gender  in difference in gender  un equal couples  intimate dyads between gender nostalgia and post genderism this essay revisits erving goffman s question regarding the connection between couple relationships and gender construction  expanding upon it by examining the ambivalent relationship of couples towards gender  in difference  in which the latter is constitutive of their formation  on the one hand  couples exploit the  in equality of their gender composition  while  on the other  they systematically ignore it in order to establish individualized personal relationships  the article culminates in a sociological diagnosis of this ambivalence  with statistical inequalities between men and women emerging as an aggregate effect of millions of small dyadic entities  each searching for their own relational meaning  how might they reconstruct their sexual inequality in view of the fact that gender is losing its relevance  meanwhile  what used to be thought of as homosexual and heterosexual relations are losing their meaning as gender relations  
 gender and performance capital among local musicians this article extends bourdieu s field theory to explain how learning spaces in the toronto folk and metal scenes create gendered access to a field specific form of cultural capital  performance capital  or the instrumental and interpersonal skills required to perform music  folk musicians develop performance capital in open access spaces  such as workshops and open stages at local folk clubs  while metal musicians learn in private spaces such as garages  basements  and rented rehearsal rooms  folk s learning spaces are open to all aspiring musicians  while access to heavy metal s learning spaces relies on social networks from which women are often excluded  these different processes of capital development can lead to greater or lesser opportunities for women to become cultural producers  in toronto  women make up approximately five percent of heavy metal musicians  but almost half of practicing folk musicians  
 gender and research productivity this paper explores the association between gender and research productivity during the doctoral phase  it investigates whether differences in scholarly productivity can be attributed to gender specific effects of parenthood or gender specific social capital endowments  to address these research questions  the study uses data from a recent survey of doctoral candidates in germany that was conducted by the dzhw  german centre for research on higher education and science studies   the results show that women publish less than men  this productivity gap results  in part  from the fact that women receive less support from their academic environment  in contrast to my initial hypotheses  i do not find any gender specific effects of parenthood on scholarly productivity  because publications have a determining influence on careers in academia  these early differences in research productivity might entail long lasting disadvantages for women

 gender differences in context  the impact of track position on study involvement in flemish secondary education this study examines whether the influence of track position on study involvement is gendered and whether gender differences in study involvement according to track position are associated with school misconduct and rather poor future perspectives  three level analyses  hlm 6  of data gathered in 2004 2005 from 11 872 third  and fifth grade students in 146 tracks in a representative sample of 85 secondary schools in flanders  belgium  confirmed the impact of tracking on boys  as well as girls  study involvement  boys are  generally  less involved in studying than girls  and boys are more affected by track position than girls are  enlarging the gender gap in the lower tracks  in these tracks  boys are more prone to misconduct and rather poor future perspectives  finally  girls in arts tracks are  on average  more involved in studying than girls in academic tracks  but because of their higher tendency for disruptive behavior in school  this does not show  
 gender on the ropes  an autoethnographic account of boxing in tasmania  australia this paper documents how i fought for a place as a boxer in a regional tasmanian boxing gym over a 30 month period  this work builds on existing ethnographic accounts that argue that  for women  becoming a boxer is more than just a matter of developing a fit body and physical skill   it is a continual project of negotiating gendered identity  using an analytic autoethnographic methodology and drawing on contemporary theories of masculinity  i share my individual experiences as a boxer and  in turn  reveal the complexities of bodywork and gendered identity within tasmanian amateur boxing culture  my closing discussion analyses the way in which performances of masculinity were precarious  fragmented and anxious  
 gender relations  livelihood strategies  water policies and structural adjustment in the australian dairy industry concerns about water scarcity and consequent environmental impacts are driving major structural adjustment in the australian irrigated dairy industry  this has resulted in government policy initiatives including water licence buybacks and grant schemes to improve water use efficiency  one consequence is the loss of many small farms and the development of larger technologically efficient farms with altered access to irrigation water  in farm families  who dominate the dairy industry  livelihood strategies  labour demands and the boundaries between traditional female and male spheres of labour are changing  we present findings from an australian research council funded project examining the impacts of these changes on dairy families in the murray dairy region  we note that reshaped livelihood strategies and increased labour demands are further entrenching traditional gender relations and that labour is being re allocated in highly gendered ways  we note a farmer manager  role is evolving amongst male dairy farmers and a critical but less public role comprising significant input to labour tasks is evident amongst women on larger farms  drawing on interviews with couples  most of whom were interviewed separately  we examine how gendered livelihood strategies are being reshaped at the same time as the significant contributions of women are being obscured  
 gender violence on college students we propose an index to measure gender violence in university students  women and men   to build this index  a questionnaire about violence is applied to a representative sample of students  then  the information is organized through an ecological model and the result is integrated in an index through the analytic hierarchy process  the proposed index was exemplified for students in the chapingo autonomous university  uach   in the uach  both women and men showed similar grades of direct violence  but women exhibited more social and emotional consequences  the proposed index allows us  1  to identify factors that influence the reproduction of violence  2  to incorporate opinions of experts  3  to get information of multiple factors and perceptions that people have about violence  finally  this index can be extended to evaluate others social issues  
 gendered representation and critical mass  women s legislative representation and social spending in 22 oecd countries to better understand the dynamics of representation of women s interests such as public expenditure on healthcare  daycare  and education  this study examines statistical evidence for the notion of critical mass  to do so  this study uses the comparative welfare states data set and the piecewise regression method to produce two linear models that best fit to the data for different ranges of the share of seats in parliament held by women  the analysis fails to find consistent support for a threshold below which women legislators have little to no impact upon policy outcomes  by adjudicating seven hypothetical thresholds  the analysis also shows that when there is a critical mass effect  the 10 percent level is more a consequential threshold than 15  20  or 30 percent levels  findings suggest that we reject the idea of a critical threshold for women s legislative representation  however  the relationship between the representation and social spending is robust with or without presumed critical mass

 german muslims and their engagement in participatory culture  reflections on civic and artistic contributions to the public sphere this paper examines publics of young german muslims  case studies include the singer huelya kandemir  the theatre group uma lamo and the social network zahnrader  by focusing on spiritual music publics  theatrical comedy publics and social publics  it tries a new approach to the way in which we understand minority public engagement  in addition to examining the concept of counterpublics  it utilizes the concept of participatory culture  which offers a relevant complement  the study argues that the publics of young german muslims display multifaceted artistic and civic engagement  which can best be understood in terms of participation in cultural or civic productions and contribution to the wider german public  features or effects of counterpublics  such as the countering of mainstream representations of minority identities and the offering of alternative discourses  are occasionally reflected in their activities  
 get real  an analysis of student preference for real food the real food challenge is a national student movement in the united states  u s   that aims to shift  1 billion roughly 20  of college and university food budgets across the country towards local  ecologically sound  fair  and humane food sources what they call  real  food by 2020  the university of vermont  uvm  was the fifth university in the u s  to sign the real food campus commitment  pledging to shift at least 20  of its own food budget towards  real  food by 2020  in order to examine student preference for  real  food on the uvm campus  we analyzed a survey of 904 undergraduate students that used contingent valuation to evaluate students  willingness to pay  wtp  for the  real  attribute  we found that a majority of students are willing to pay a positive premium for  real  food  furthermore  we found that student characteristics and attitudes significantly influence wtp  specifically  gender  residency  college  and attitudes about price and origin of food are significant predictors of wtp  
 getting a sense of agriculture  visitor experiences from an agricultural fair this article explores how different visitors experience the performances  promotions and each other at denmark s most visited agricultural fair  visitors acknowledge differences between urban and rural visitors but no tension or conflict  embodied knowledge and tactile experiences seem like the most legitimate way to understand agriculture from the perspective of both rural urban and farming non farming visitors  and they are also a key thematic focus in this article  some performances even provide the visitor with a sense of trust in agriculture which  temporarily at least  can mitigate concerns about the overall food production system  making sense of the activities at the fair seems to be achieved through embodied experiences as well as broader cultural identifications relating to and integrating images and experiences of landscapes  people and animals and their interaction  the results of this article should thus contribute to the sociological body of work trying to make sense of the changing meanings and roles of agriculture and farmers to the general public  as well as provide insights into how such meanings are created and maintained both inside and outside of the event  
 global finance  labor politics  and the political economy of housing prices international political economy identifies declining nominal interest rates  securitization  and financial liberalization as drivers of rising housing prices  despite witnessing these common credit shocks  however  developed economies experienced divergent trends in housing inflation since the 1980s  we offer a comparative political economy explanation of variation in house prices  arguing that by restraining household incomes  wage setting institutions can blunt financial liberalization s inflationary impact on housing markets  employing quantitative analysis and a comparative study of ireland and the netherlands  we uncover two findings  first  countries where political coalitions in the export sector held veto powers over those in the nontraded sector in national wage setting realized lower housing inflation  second  the impact of sectoral coalitions on housing prices in oecd countries is similar to that of financial variables  our results suggest that the organization of labor politics continues to play an important role in mitigating the destabilizing effects of global finance on developed economies  
 global production in a romanian village  middle income economy  industrial dislocation and the reserve army of labor this article contributes to the discussion about the process of relocation of industrial production  the study focuses on a community in eastern europe which witnessed a cycle of events  from localization of a high scale global factory in 2007 to its unexpected displacement in 2012  in this study is analyzed the process of the community s inclusion in the production system  and it is argued that the challenge of production mobility is distinctively different in middle income economies  employing a cultural approach to the study of global production  the process of social reconstruction caused by the investment is chronologically outlined and its outcomes for the local labor market and host community are described  
 globalization and contemporary fertility convergence the rise of the global network of nation states has precipitated social transformations throughout the world  this article examines the role of political and economic globalization in driving fertility convergence across countries between 1965 and 2009  while past research has typically conceptualized fertility change as a country level process  this study instead employs a theoretical and methodological framework that examines differences in fertility between pairs of countries over time  convergence in fertility between pairs of countries is hypothesized to result from increased cross country connectedness and cross national transmission of fertility related schemas  i investigate the impact of various cross country ties  including ties through bilateral trade  intergovernmental organizations  and regional trade blocs  on fertility convergence  i find that globalization acts as a form of social interaction to produce fertility convergence  there is significant heterogeneity in the effects of different cross country ties  in particular  trade with rich model countries  joint participation in the un and unesco  and joining a free trade agreement all contribute to fertility convergence between countries  whereas the prevailing focus in fertility research has been on factors producing fertility declines  this analysis highlights specific mechanisms trade and connectedness through organizations leading to greater similarity in fertility across countries  globalization is a process that propels the spread of culturally laden goods and schemas impinging on fertility  which in turn produces fertility convergence  
 globalization  technology and female empowerment  breaking rights or connecting opportunities  what are the main impacts of globalization and new information and communication technologies  icts  on female empowerment  the first part of this paper surveys two main disputing arguments concerning this issue through a review of the literature investigating the causal mechanisms that links both dimensions  one stream of academia highlights the negative impacts of globalization  it argues how market liberalization resulted in the weakening of welfare policies and the flexibilization of labor rights  another stream of literature emphasizes the role played by international organizations  like the world bank  as well as civil society movements  and highlights how globalization made it possible for women conquer an important place in their societies  this paper attempts to add to these analyses the assumption that icts provided differential opportunities to women  the second part of the paper verifies which arguments are most consistent with empirical data  in a panel analysis from 2000 to 2014 we focus on how globalization may have affected female economic empowerment  measured as women s participation in the work force  and political representation  measured as women participation on the labor force and participation in national parliaments   we find evidence that access to icts may represent a crucial variable to enhance women s empowerment  
 goffman  identity and organizational control  elite sports academies and social theory traineeship within english professional football  soccer  has attracted much attention in recent years yet few studies have explored in any real depth the everyday workings of trainee footballing lives  this paper features the findings of two small scale qualitative studies of football traineeship both of which were carried out at high profile english professional football clubs  one in 1993 94  the other in 2010 11  the paper uncovers the nuances of trainee experience in line with a series of theoretical assertions surrounding organizational discipline and control  it concludes by suggesting that while debate surrounding the design and delivery of traineeship within professional football has intensified over the past two decades  little appears to have changed with respect to the fundamental dynamics of organizational regimen  
 going the distance  individualism and interdependence in the commuter marriage commuter spousesdual income couples who live apart for their professional careershave been the subject of relatively little scholarly research  another  largely theoretical body of scholarship has explored the fundamental cultural tension generated by the simultaneous embracing of personal autonomy and the institution of marriage in the united states  although few scholars have explicitly sought to understand how these seemingly conflicting cultural goals play out on the ground  drawing on data from in depth interviews  n 97   the analysis finds that commuter couples indeed engaged in two discourses about their marriages that operated in tension  although they positioned themselves as highly individualistic  interdependence was a key theme in their responses as well  surprisingly  a substantial minority of respondents indicated that their noncohabitation enhanced their interdependence  these results not only shed light on this understudied population but also broaden our understanding of the evolving cultural meaning of marriage  
 good moral panics  normative ambivalence  social reaction  and coexisting responsibilities in everyday life this article breaks the silence on the politically progressive characteristics of a moral panic  in contrast to the tacit scholarly consensus that moral panics entail regressively conservative social reactions to putative harms  moral panics are alternatively conceptualized as normatively ambivalent operations of power  the article builds on continuing efforts to conceptualize moral panic as a form of moral regulation by explaining how moral panics are capable of perpetuating as well as disrupting and potentially even reversing the norms of intelligibility that buttress hegemonic understandings of  and moral responsiveness to  violence  injustice  suffering  and harm  
 governance in sport for development  problems and possibilities of  not  learning from international development the lack of attention towards issues of governance in both global sport for development  sfd  policy and academic literature is placed in stark relief when compared to the significance accorded to such issues in international development  this article addresses this lacuna in sport for development by drawing on international development literature as well as interview data from representatives of international agencies  domestic governments and in country non governmental organisations involved with sport for development in ghana and tanzania  as previously recognised in other development sectors  the commonality of narrow  project based approaches in sport for development contributes to excessive donor influence  fragmentation  competition and limits both impact and sustainability  it was in response to similar problems that  from the mid 1990s  sector wide approaches were instigated within specific sectors in particular countries as a more systematic model of development governance based on leadership by the domestic government and co ordination among donors and other stakeholders  although interviewees  perspectives and some exemplar sport for development initiatives aligned with key features of sector wide approaches  significant challenges to their effective instigation in sport for development can be identified  nevertheless  examining the applicability of sector wide approaches to sport for development raises important issues that require further consideration and demonstrates the necessity that sport for development  more generally  learns from the longer established field of international development  
 governing social innovation  exploring the role of  discretionary practice  in the negotiation of shared spaces of community food growing despite the extensive areas of under used green and brownfield land that remain in public ownership  little academic attention has thus far been given to the role of the public sector in utilising this resource for shared forms of community food growing  building upon recent calls for more research targeted towards the governance of social innovation  but also the spaces and places in which it occurs  this article presents an in depth qualitative account of one such public sector led attempt at instigating the co production of community food growing  guided by social innovation theory and lipsky s  1980  street level bureaucracy  the discussion pays particular attention to the discretional practice of front line public sector workers  whilst at one level public sector led initiatives lack sufficient intention or scope for bringing about the transformation of existing social orders  their contribution to propagating individual and smaller scale occurrences of social innovation in the context of community food security should nevertheless not be overlooked  it is by adopting a more micro level  situated and process orientated approach to the analysis of alternative forms of collaborative public sector led community food growing  that it becomes possible to evidence the presence of innovative practice as it unfolds on the ground  
 governments  grassroots  and the struggle for local food systems  containing  coopting  contesting and collaborating local sustainable food systems have captured the popular imagination as a progressive  if not radical  pillar of a sustainable food future  yet these grassroots innovations are embedded in a dominant food regime that reflects productivist  industrial  and neoliberal policies and institutions  understanding the relationship between these emerging grassroots efforts and the dominant food regime is of central importance in any transition to a more sustainable food system  in this study  we examine the encounters of direct farm marketers with food safety regulations and other government policies and the role of this interface in shaping the potential of local food in a wider transition to sustainable agri food systems  this mixed methods research involved interview and survey data with farmers and ranchers in both the usa and canada and an in depth case study in the province of manitoba  we identified four distinct types of interactions between government and farmers  containing  coopting  contesting  and collaborating  the inconsistent enforcement of food safety regulations is found to contain progressive efforts to change food systems  while government support programs for local food were helpful in some regards  they were often considered to be inadequate or inappropriate and thus served to coopt discourse and practice by primarily supporting initiatives that conform to more mainstream approaches  farmers and other grassroots actors contested these food safety regulations and inadequate government support programs through both individual and collective action  finally  farmers found ways to collaborate with governments to work towards mutually defined solutions  while containing and coopting reflect technologies of governmentality that reinforce the status quo  both collaborating and contesting reflect opportunities to affect or even transform the dominant regime by engaging in alternative economic activities as part of the  politics of possibility   developing a better understanding of the nature of these interactions will help grassroots movements to create effective strategies for achieving more sustainable and just food systems  
 grooving in the ludic foodscape  bridled revelry in collegiate tailgating throughout north america  the open air public feasting and drinking that surrounds an athletic event  most commonly football  is labeled tailgating  in this article  we explore how consumers infuse their place creating activity with a well modulated aura of revelry that energizes tailgating without jeopardizing either its immediate or long term viability  to an appreciable degree  tailgating is about celebrating and preserving the communal bond enkindled in the primal hearth  we characterize tailgating as a ludic foodscape in an attempt to capture the kinetic  multisensory backdrop and atmosphere of playful consumer creativity against which the revelry of feasting and drinking unfolds  our study is located at the intersection of inquiries into foodscapes  brandscapes  and landscapes  among the interpretive themes emerging from our ethnographic analysis  we have implicated three in particular in the generation and modulation of the revelry that distinguishes tailgating from some of its more bacchanalian cousins  cuisine  carnivalesque  and canalization  these themes can be understood as social regulators that literally govern tailgating  endowing it with just the right amount of license to give it a festive edge without resulting in too disruptive or dysfunctional an atmosphere  we unpack the three cogs in this mechanism and analyze their relevance to the atmosphere pervading the sites of tailgating  
 groundhog day  nietzsche  deleuze and the eternal return of prosumption in lifelong learning this conceptual article examines george ritzer s concept of prosumption in the context of lifelong learning in the united kingdom  ritzer s references to prosumption as a form of eternal return of a  primal act   which draw on the work of friedrich nietzsche and gilles deleuze  introduce some ambiguity into the concept  this ambiguity echoes a certain polarization in the debate about co creation  especially regarding the nature of consumer participation in the creation of value  but it is central to defining the limits of consumer freedom and agency  critical analysis of uk lifelong learning discourse shows how prosumption can work as a tool of control in this context  producing docile subjectivities  compliant forms of creative co production and disposable  nothing  products through repetition and a return of the same  where prosumption is able to challenge this repetition  however  it involves creativity and the return of difference  these examples show how eternal return  ultimately  underpins prosumption s claim to offer a valid description of emerging practices of prosuming lifelong learners  
 gun shops as local institutions  federal firearms licensees  social disorganization  and neighborhood violent crime recently  scholars have argued that local social and economic institutions  such as bars and payday lenders  can influence neighborhood crime outcomes  drawing on routine activities theory and social disorganization theory  such research has posited that such institutions can directly affect crime rates by providing potential targets or encouraging criminal behavior  and can indirectly affect crime rates by discouraging social control efforts  we draw on this literature  as well as the literature on reactions to firearm prevalence  to examine the effects of gun shops on local crime rates  using data for the year 2000 drawn from the national neighborhood crime study  nncs   the bureau of alcohol  tobacco  firearms  and explosives  federal firearms licensees database  ffld   and the national establishment time series longitudinal business database  nets   we use hierarchical linear models to examine how the prevalence of gun shops at the tract and metro level contribute to tract level rates of violent crime in eighty nine large us cities  our findings indicate that gun shop prevalence in urban areas is associated with increased rates of homicides and robberies  and that these effects are more pronounced in neighborhoods characterized by residential instability  we conclude with a discussion of policy considerations and avenues for future research on local institutions  
 habit and the politics of social change  a comparison of nudge theory and pragmatist philosophy re thinking the political workings of habit and habituation  this article suggests  is vital to understanding the logics and possibilities of social change today  any endeavour to explore habit s affirmative potential  however  must confront its legacies as a colonialist  imperialist and capitalist technology  as a means to explore what it is that differentiates contemporary neoliberal modes of governing through habit from more critical approaches  this article compares contemporary nudge  theory and policy  as espoused by the behavioural economist richard thaler and the legal scholar cass sunstein  with the pragmatist philosophies of habit offered by john dewey  william james and shannon sullivan  while nudge advocates focus on how policy makers and corporate leaders can intervene in the choice architectures  that surround us to outsmart or bypass problematic human tendencies  i argue  pragmatist philosophers appreciate the necessity of collective efforts to develop new and flexible forms of habituation in order to engender more enduring and democratic forms of social transformation  
 habitual reflexivity and skilled action theorists have used the concept of habitus to explain how skilled agents are capable of responding in an infinite number of ways to the infinite number of possible situations that they encounter in their field of practice  according to some perspectives  habitus is seen to represent a form of regulated improvisation that functions below the threshold of consciousness  however  bourdieu argued that rational and conscious computation may be required in situations of crisis  where habitus proves insufficient as a basis for our actions  in the current article  i draw on a range of evidence which indicates that conscious intervention  including self reflective sensory consciousness  is required not only at points of crisis but also as skilled performers engage in the mundane actions practices that characterize their everyday training and performance regimes  the interaction of conscious learning and unconscious schemata leads to the development of a reflexive habitus which allows performers to refine and adapt embodied movement patterns over time  
 habitus  affordances  and family leisure  cultural reproduction through children s leisure activities informed by gibson s affordances and bourdieu s habitus  this visual ethnographic study explores parents  ideas about learning and leisure and the actual domestic leisure children  between three to seven years old  consume in association with socioeconomic status  it is found that parent informants have similar reservations about local education regardless of socioeconomic status  nevertheless  their different socioeconomic and cultural backgrounds contribute to their different involvement in children s learning and leisure through their use of the domestic setup  television and computing devices  and toys  through leisure  middle class parent informants transmit certain emotions  values  skills  behavioral dispositions  and tastes to their children  which coincide with institutional approaches to learning  the study finds that children s domestic leisure is largely patterned by materials  domestic setup and leisure induced appliances   practices  tv and mobile computing usage and toy selection and play  and social structure  and thus links considerably to children s disparity in academic achievements and attitudes towards learning  
 hans kohn  the idea of secularized nationalism more than seventy years after its publication  hans kohn s 1944 the idea of nationalism is still regarded as a ground breaking contribution to the study of nationalism  this essay is aimed to highlight a significant theme in this work which has largely gone unnoticed  namely  the pivotal role of religion and secularism in kohn s account of nationalism  and especially  in his persistent struggle for a perfect  nationalism  kohn s conception   and personal experience   of the relationship of nationalism and religion will be examined through several stages of his turbulent life  first  as a young zionist in prague  when he parlayed martin buber s zionist creed into an ethnic concept of nationalism  then  in kohn s journalistic writing in the 1920s and in his first theoretical works on nationalism in the years 1929 1942  finally  kohn s more mature and crystallized account of nationalism in his 1944 book will be revisited from the perspective of the nationalism religion relationship  
 happy tourists  unhappy locals the most recent of literature focuses more often on the happiness of tourists  rather than the happiness of residents affected by tourism  however  this study aims at filling this gap with a new and refreshing perspective  this is carried out by using the european social survey  2010 2012  merged with eurostat tourism data at the province  nuts2  level  staying consistent with homophily or ingroup preference theories  we find that domestic tourists contribute more to the happiness of locals than foreign tourists  also by staying consistent with irridex theory  we find that tourism at low levels of development contributes more to happiness than tourism at a high level of development  
 harmonious or out of tune  cooperation between the television industry and the music business in talent contests of the 2000s in recent years  the television industry has cooperated closely with the music business in producing talent contests such as idols  x factor and the voice  while these music contests have been one of the most popular entertainment trends of the 2000s  their ratings and associated music sales have dropped substantially  this article explores opportunities and limitations in the cooperation between television and music production  examining differences in industrial practices and the ways in which these practices are being affected by digitisation and globalisation  its empirical approach involves interviews with television and music professionals  as well as amateur participants of talent contests in norway  the article finds that structural differences between these industries trigger struggles over the content and presentation of musical performances which  over time  undermine the credibility of the joint venture  however  the flow model  of television and the editorial model  of music are presently undergoing transformation within the digital media context that in turn afford new opportunities for corporate collaboration and for musical talents to find their audiences  
 have we seen the geneticisation of society  expectations and evidence abby lippman s geneticisation thesis  of the early 1990s  argued and anticipated that with the rise of genetics  increasing areas of social and health related activities would come to be understood and defined in genetic terms leading to major changes in society  medicine and health care  we review the considerable literature on geneticisation and consider how the concept stands both theoretically and empirically across scientific  clinical  popular and lay discourse and practice  social science scholarship indicates that relatively little of the original claim of the geneticisation thesis has been realised  highlighting the development of more complex and dynamic accounts of disease in scientific discourse and the complexity of relationships between bioscientific  clinical and lay understandings  this scholarship represents a shift in social science understandings of the processes of sociotechnical change  which have moved from rather simplistic linear models to an appreciation of disease categories as multiply understood  despite these shifts  we argue that a genetic imaginary persists  which plays a performative role in driving investments in new gene based developments  understanding the enduring power of this genetic imaginary and its consequences remains a key task for the social sciences  one which treats ongoing genetic expectations and predictions in a sceptical yet open way  
 have your cake and eat it too  the well being of the italians  1861 2011  as a part of the international debate on beyond the gdp  this paper describes the temporal trend of the multidimensional well being of the italians from 1861 to 2011  building on the cnel and istat s equitable and sustainable well being  benessere equo e sostenibile  bes  project  the paper selects 41 indicators that are grouped into eight dimensions characterizing the most important aspects of everyday life  health  education  work  economic well being  political participation  security  environment and research and development  in order to synthesize the information provided by this large set of indicators  a composite index for each dimension is tracked over the time span of 150 years  the main contributions of this paper consist in providing an analysis of the italian bes over such a long period  as a result  the eight domains exhibit temporal tendencies that are different from the one of economic well being  in particular  health  education  work and political participation show a pattern increasing over time  analogously to economic well being   although at different growth rates  while an overall declining path emerges for the domains of security  environment and research and development  moreover  we identify four main periods of the italian history  before wwi  the fascist period  the years from 1950 to 1990 and the most recent period  each characterized by different relations among the well being domains  
 health  quality of homecare services and quality of life  a case of frail older immigrant adults this study explores the roles of two health related concepts on the relationship between quality of homecare services and quality of life among a group of frail older immigrants residing in a large city in the midwest region of the united states  analyzing data from a community based social service agency  this study tested two hypotheses   1  health related quality of life mediated the relationship between quality of health related social services and overall quality of life  and  2  perceived importance of health moderated the relationship between quality of health related social services and quality of life  results of this study show that health related quality of life  measured by satisfaction with health  mediated the relationship between quality of health related social services  measured by satisfaction with homecare services  and overall quality of life  measured by overall life satisfaction  in addition  perceived importance of health moderated the relationship between quality of health related social services  measured by satisfaction with homecare services  and quality of life  measured by overall life satisfaction  quality of homecare services is significantly associated with clients  quality of life  homecare services may contribute to clients  satisfaction with health which  in turn  enhances clients  overall quality of life  the association between quality of homecare services and quality of life is likely to differ  depending on how important health is perceived  
 health related strains and subsequent delinquency and marijuana use general strain theory provides one framework for explaining the relationship between physical health and delinquency  pointing to mechanisms such as negative emotions  social bonds  and stress proliferation  data from the national longitudinal study of adolescent health were used to examine these hypothetical mediators  controlling for demographic factors  prior illicit behavior  and other strains  results from a series of regressions indicated that health related strain  hrs  was positively associated with subsequent delinquency and marijuana use  stressors at school were the primary mediators of these effects  absences from school and social life due to health problems exerted an independent effect  the results lend support to the idea that experiencing hrs contributes to the proliferation of stress in other life domains  increasing the likelihood of delinquency and marijuana use  
 help search practices in rehabilitation team meetings  a sacksian analysis using harvey sacks s concept of membership categorization devices  mcds   this article examines the help search sequences in which japanese rehabilitation team members use a set of categories to locate the availability of stroke family caregivers  specifically  based on an analysis of audiovisual data from rehabilitation team conferences in japan  the article illustrates the ways in which participants at the meetings   1  evaluate the expectable behaviors of various category incumbents   2  classify which category of person is proper to turn to for help  and  3  arrive at the conclusion that no one is available  and so the patient must be institutionalized  analysis shows that participants routinely choose co resident family members to fulfill the caregiver position  however  the position is not guaranteed unless the selected incumbent can satisfy additional criteria  especially physical strength and time availability  by exploring the ways in which participants use categories to negotiate discharge destinations  the article adds to sacks s analysis by illustrating methodical activities for deciding whether someone is unavailable to help  moreover  it considers the applicability of sacks s notion of mcds to japanese data  
 heterogeneity in the relationship between country level affluence and environmental concern despite sustained attention  scholars disagree about the relationship between country level affluence and the environmental concern of mass publics  while many studies assume this relationship to be uniform  we argue that it is reasonable to expect meaningful variation in the association between country level affluence and concern across countries with different levels of wealth  we place this idea at the center of our analyses  to do so  we assess public willingness to pay for environmental protection using five waves of world values survey data  examining 101 country years nested in forty two countries spanning nineteen years  results from mixed effects logistic and linear regression models reveal substantial heterogeneity in the association between environmental concern and country level affluence  we find that growth in affluence over time associates with higher mass environmental concern  but only among less affluent countries  in contrast  countries that are on average more affluent tend to have lower environmental concern  but again  this relationship is primarily concentrated among less affluent countries  although a variety of theories can be usefully applied to particular relationships occurring along the range of affluence  we argue that degradation theories go far in explaining the heterogeneous associations uncovered between environmental concern and country level affluence  that associations are largely concentrated among less affluent countries has implications for the understanding of environmental concern in wealthy countries and the development of policy to address environmental reform  these issues are discussed in the conclusion  
 hidden in plain sight  how industry  mass media  and consumers  everyday habits suppress food controversies in this article  i develop the concept of suppressive synergy  to explain how meat products retain their everyday legitimacy amongst consumers despite the controversies which surround these products  while sociologists have offered various explanations for and solutions to contemporary food controversies  absent from this literature is a more integrated explanation as to how industry  mass media  and consumers  everyday habits reciprocally limit the public s engagement with these arguments  i investigated this empirically elusive phenomenon by conducting six focus groups plus follow up interviews with urban meat consumers in the us and a content analysis of meat related articles in the new york times  1983 2011   findings indicate that suppressive synergy occurs on both spatial temporal and cognitive affective dimensions  the meat and livestock industry enchants consumers with ornate products while sequestering production facilities in remote areas  consumers  resistant to abandon their everyday habits and the cultural imperative of meat consumption  routinely avoid and dissociate themselves from meat related controversies  the mass media further normalises meat culture by infrequently covering these debates  this only reinforces public indifference  as the dearth of controversial stories bolsters the cultural presupposition that meat consumption is a generally benign activity  
 hiding in the dark  local ecological knowledge about slow loris in sarawak sheds light on relationships between human populations and wild animals local ecological knowledge  lek  increases understanding of certain species and the threats they face  especially little studied taxa for which data on distribution and conservation are often lacking  we conducted 111 semi structured interviews in sarawak  malaysia  to collect local knowledge about the behavior and distribution of the philippine slow loris  nycticebus menagensis  from two ethnic groups  the iban and the penan  our study revealed that male penan respondents  generally hunters  who frequently go into the forest were better at identifying animals from pictures  overall  the penan have a more detailed knowledge of slow loris behaviors  habitat  and distribution than the iban  the two ethnic groups have different attitudes towards slow loris as the penan hunt  eat  or keep them as pets while the iban consider them sacred and signifiers of good luck  we advocate the use of lek for providing complementary information to scientific methods in the study of cryptic animals  
 hip hop world news  reporting back responding to the bbc 4 documentary  the hip hop world news  the author examines a number of debates that the programme  narrated by rodney p  a pioneer of british rap music  and a believer in the revolutionary potential of hip hop culture  throws up  for hip hop also has many reactionary elements and has become big business for the corporations and rap  stars  involved in its production  beyond just pointing to individual rappers who have been  conscious  political voices  such as public enemy s chuck d  we are shown structures embedded in the origins and  elements  of hip hop that continue to make it a  voice of the voiceless   some people  like lord jamar  who is interviewed on the documentary  have argued that hip hop as a black art form can only be performed by black artists  yet  as rodney p points out  hip hop has been adopted everywhere to express and transmit the situations and struggles of marginalised and oppressed groups all over the globe  
 historical contestants  african american documentary traditions in on the shoulders of giants this case study of deborah morales s on the shoulders of giants  the story of the greatest team you ve never heard of  2011  examines african american documentary s relationship to sports documentaries  on the shoulders of giants chronicles the experiences and cultural impact of the harlem rens  the first all black professional basketball team  grounding the documentary in african american documentary film and video traditions  i explore how specific authorial  aesthetic  and representational practices and politics shape and structure the film s historical interventions  just as the documentary centers the rens s embodied  athletic and social  experiences  my study of these practices and politics privileges the real  represented  and referenced black body bodies in the film as a critical site of analysis for such interventions  in doing so  i read the black sporting body as an expressive  communicative body with critical muscle memory  an embodied history represented on screen that goes beyond the film s diegesis  that engages social issues  conditions  and changes specific to black lived and imagined experiences  in turn  i suggest that black sports documentaries are discourses that document  are indicative of  and construct critical muscle memory  
 hitmazrehut or becoming of the east  re orienting israeli social mapping through developing of the concept of hitmazrehut  the article highlights avenues for decolonializing and de orientalizing sociopolitical theory and practice in israel palestine  hitmazrehut  literally  becoming of the east   is understood as the transformation of relations between space  identity  and narrative through an intersectionality framework of social movement activism and intellectual counter discourse  exposing the intersections among sites of marginality as well as cultivating localized interpretations of identity  delinked from the orientalist positing of israel in the  west   would contribute to the possibility of the formation of transformative coalition building across national boundaries  hitmazrehut is both an outcome and a necessary process for enabling geopolitical reframing  the article begins with the ahistorical and orientalist biases of sociological inquiry into the region  it continues with an analysis of efforts to localize and re orient jewish identity as well as the mizrahi discursive critique of epistemological violence guiding sociological scholarship  double consciousness and patterns of ethnic passing  
 host or hostile  attitudes towards asylum seekers in israel and in denmark in this study  we focus on attitudes towards asylum seekers in two countries  denmark and israel  both serve as interesting cases through which to study public sentiment of host populations for people seeking refuge  we examine the role of three core dimensions that have been relatively overlooked in previous studies  social contact with asylum seekers  the role of support for humanitarian policies and perceptions of legitimacy of the asylum seekers  claims  we also gauge the way perceptions of threat mediate the effect of these core dimensions on individuals  willingness to share their national benefits with those looking for refugee status in the two countries  for the analysis  we use multiple group structural equation modelling  on the descriptive level  findings suggest that respondents are considerably more hostile in israel than in denmark  although the mechanisms leading to the formation of exclusionary attitudes are partly similar  we conclude with some limitations of the study and closing remarks about similarities and differences across the two countries  
 how do investments in human resource management practices affect firm specific risk in the restaurant industry  despite the importance of achieving a competitive advantage in human resources in the restaurant industry  restaurant firms often hesitate to make significant investments in human resource management  hrm  practices because of outcome uncertainty  operational issues  and limited financial resources  among other issues  building upon the strategic human resource management  shrm  literature  the current study attempts to better understand the hrm issues in the restaurant industry and investigate the effects of hrm practices on a firm s risk  more specifically  we explore the separate effects of positive and negative hrm practices on firm specific risk  i e   unsystematic risk  in the restaurant industry  our findings demonstrate that positive hrm practices have a nonsignificant relationship with firms  unsystematic risk  but negative hrm practices have an inverted u shaped relationship with unsystematic risk  supporting the stakeholder theory  theory of desensitization  and slack resource theory  
 how do meat scarcity and bushmeat commodification influence sharing and giving among forest foragers  a view from the central african republic meat sharing is a societal norm among hunter gatherer societies that provisions families and supports social networks  meat is also a valued resource central to traditional barter exchange  ethnographic research often cites prey scarcity and commodification as two factors reducing traditional meat transactions among indigenous central african foragers  we present quantitative data based on ethnographic observations of foragers in the central african republic that show that neither scarcity nor commodification eliminates sharing  the bushmeat market is associated with changes in village demographic structure that limits the distribution of meat among extended kin  although cash generated from the sale of forest products reduces the need for inter ethnic barter  gift giving and exchange maintain these important relationships  our data show the persistence of traditional meat transactions and identify potential changes in demographic structure as a less obvious outcome of the bushmeat trade that can have extended consequences for forager populations

 how global is my local milk  evaluating the first order inputs of  local  milk in hawai i local food is gaining in popularity  particularly within a rising alternative food movement  yet it remains an ambiguous term  we use an illustrative example the case of  local milk  in hawai i to demonstrate this point  we evaluate  localness  by measuring the origins of production inputs by economic value and physical mass an approach that is akin to the made in america standard  the innovative method we propose is easily replicable to other food products or locations worldwide  we find that most first order production related inputs are obtained from non local sources  our findings are significant to the local food debate because a focus beyond the point of production to upstream inputs in the life cycle of a food item can push towards a re framing what local means both in hawai i and beyond  in particular  our findings suggest that production system type  as opposed to location of production end point  might have a greater impact on the degree of localness of a product  looking forward  a shift in focus towards production system characteristics may help researchers make headway in exploring the environmental and economic effects of local food  
 how terrorism affects attitudes toward democracy  tunisia in 2015 tunisia is the only country that emerged from the arab spring as a democracy  however  tunisian democracy is threatened by political divisions  economic problems  and the threat of terrorist attacks  we shed light on tunisia s democratic prospects by examining  1  the degree to which major terrorist attacks in 2015 influenced tunisian public opinion on democracy and  2  the extent to which preference for a democratic system affected opinions on the prospects for democracy in tunisia  we use data from three waves of a nationwide survey conducted just before and just after tunisia s first major terrorist attack  and just after the country s second major terrorist attack  we demonstrate that after the attacks the tunisian public became less favourable toward democracy and less optimistic that tunisia would soon be ready for it  such scepticism was widespread  affecting people who preferred democracy as much as those who did not  we conclude that the prospects for tunisian democracy are more precarious than is sometimes assumed  
 how to construct a mixed methods research design this article provides researchers with knowledge of how to design a high quality mixed methods research study  to design a mixed study  researchers must understand and carefully consider each of the dimensions of mixed methods design  and always keep an eye on the issue of validity  we explain the seven major design dimensions  purpose  theoretical drive  timing  simultaneity and dependency   point of integration  typological versus interactive design approaches  planned versus emergent design  and design complexity  there also are multiple secondary dimensions that need to be considered during the design process  we explain ten secondary dimensions of design to be considered for each research study  we also provide two case studies showing how the mixed designs were constructed  
 human development and national culture  a multivariate exploration we examine the relationship between different aspects of human development and hofstede s six dimensions of national culture  using multivariate regression and canonical correlation analysis  we show that all the dimensions of national culture except masculinity have a significant impact on human development  and that the overall strength of the association between the two groups of variables is a high positive one  in general  the direction of the influence of the national culture variables on economic growth differs from the manner they influence other variables  which reinforces the fact that economic growth does not always translate into true people centred development  furthermore  the national culture dimensions do not explain much of the variation in a number of health indicators  
 hybrid social and news media protest events  from  marchinmarch to  bustthebudget in australia public protest events are now both social media and news media events  they are deeply entangled  with news media actors   such as journalists or news organisations   directly participating in the protest by tweeting about the event using the protest hashtag  and social media actors sharing news items published online by professional news agencies  protesters have always deployed tactics to engage the media and use news media agencies  resources to amplify their reach  with the dual aim of mobilising new supporters and adding their voice to public  mediatised debate  when protest moves between a physical space and a virtual space  the interactions between protesters and media stop being asynchronous or post hoc and turn instantaneous  in this new media protest ecosystem  traditional media are still relevant sources of information and legitimacy  yet this dynamic is increasingly underpinned by a hybrid interdependency between traditional news and social media sources  in this paper we focus on an anti austerity government movement that arose in australia in early 2014 and was mobilised as a series of social media driven  connective action protest events  we show that there is a complex symbiotic interdependency between the movement and the traditional media for recognition and amplification of initial protest events  but that over time as media interest wanes  the movements  network becomes disconnected and momentum is lost  this suggests that the active role traditional media play in protest events is being underestimated in the current research agenda on connective action  
 identifying attributes of food system sustainability  emerging themes and consensus achieving food system sustainability is one of the more pressing challenges of this century  over the last decades  experts from diverse disciplines and intellectual traditions have worked to document the critical threats to food system sustainability and to define an appropriate agenda for action  nevertheless  these efforts have tended to focus selectively on only a few components of the food system or have tended to be framed in particular discourses  depending on the point of departure  what aspects of the food system are considered threatened  and what must be sustained  can differ greatly between perspectives  in this article  we draw from systems thinking and social ecological systems concepts to focus on the underlying process related attributes that could support a more sustainable food system  we then examine the support for specific system attributes in six different knowledge domains addressing sustainable agriculture and food  from this review  we identify five system attributes diversity  modularity  transparency  innovation and congruence that are repeatedly featured in the different knowledge domains as critical aspects of food system sustainability  we argue that in the face of considerable complexity and high uncertainty  these attributes can serve as a guide to conceptualizing food system choices adaptively and iteratively  
 ideology and resistance in young people s experiences of health under the  imperative of enjoyment  this article explores upper secondary school students  understandings and experiences of health in denmark  where public health promotions appeal to pleasure  health promotion thereby taps into capitalist society s imperative of enjoyment   which reproduces ideological fantasies about the fulfilment of desires through the consumption of health  based on qualitative empirical material produced through participatory and visual methods during fieldwork conducted in 2012  the analysis shows that relations between healthiness and pleasure are conflated and paradoxical  the students try to fit into society not only by being healthy  but also by enjoying healthiness  but if they fail pleasure  they fail healthiness and experience a loss of individual social value  although the enjoyment society  has the potential to produce individualisation and marginalisation  the students in this study actively attempt to subvert its double bind by insisting that collective experiences with peers constitutes the foundation of enjoyable healthiness  nevertheless  public health promotions that reproduce enjoyment as an imperative  even in the pursuit of health  risk reinforcing young people s resistance towards health  
 illuminating a dark side of the american dream  assessing the prevalence and predictors of mortgage fraud across us counties using novel county level data  the authors document that nearly 25  of residential mortgage loans originated between 2003 and 2005 in america contained one or more indications of mortgage fraud but also that rates were highly variable across counties  multivariate regression models reveal that rates of mortgage fraud were higher in areas with greater loan volumes  a larger share of loans originated by independent mortgage companies  elevated rates of preexisting property crime  and higher levels of black white racial segregation  it was less prevalent where government sponsored enterprises purchased a larger share of the loans sold in secondary mortgage markets  the findings are most consistent with classic and contemporary anomie theories and perspectives that highlight the geographic targeting of selected housing markets with loan products and tactics that provided fertile ground for mortgage fraud  the authors discuss the implications of these patterns for developing a more comprehensive understanding of contemporary spatial inequalities  
 immigrant integration policy for future generations  a cross national multilevel analysis of immigrant background adolescents  sense of belonging at school the present study examined whether an immigrant integration policy effort that is geared toward the educational inclusion of all adolescents may actually work toward the reduction of the gap between immigrant background and non immigrant students in their sense of social belonging at school  this study posited that a relatively lower sense of belonging at school among immigrant background adolescents may be a manifestation of systemic social exclusion that permeates the educational system of a given country  thus hypothesizing that a public policy approach may be effective as a systemic intervention  a series of hierarchical generalized linear modeling analyses of data from 52 446 children across 2 248 schools in 25 countries was conducted  the results suggested that government efforts to formulate and enforce educational policies for immigrant integration may have some positive effect on the social inclusion of immigrant background adolescents in school settings  this study has substantial significance as it provides an evidentiary base on the tangible impact of multicultural policies  
 immigration and economic crisis  an analysis of the impact in spain  2007 2013 this article illustrates the phenomenon of migration as a key for analyzing neoliberal as well as keynesian logic  the european socio economic frame of integration is defined as a four fold complex consisting of an employment regime  types of labor markets   forms of consumption  a system of social protection  and a type of socio political integration  it is shown that the articulation of these four levels produces virtuoso or perverse cycles of social integration  using official data  it can be seen that the spanish labor market has suffered structural changes since the post 2007 economic crisis  including alteration in work activities  occupations and the unemployment level of the labor force  deterioration for specific groups such as young people and immigrants  and increased risk of poverty  with the deepening of the crisis  immigrants have found themselves trapped in spain s network of unemployment  temporary employment  lack of stable employment prospects  irregular economics  increased risk of poverty  and a perverse cycle of exclusion that calls into question not only the effectiveness of european neoliberal policies but the entire european social model  
 immigration and the welfare state  a cross regional analysis of european welfare attitudes a growing body of research connects diversity to anti welfare attitudes and lower levels of social welfare expenditure  yet most evidence comes from analyses of us states or comparisons of the united states to europe  comparative analyses of european nation states  however  yield little evidence that immigration   measured at the country level   reduces support for national welfare state programs  this is not surprising  given that research suggests that the impact of diversity occurs at smaller  sub national geographic units  therefore  in this article  we test the hypothesis that immigration undermines welfare attitudes by assessing the impact of immigration measured at the regional level on individual level support for redistribution  a comprehensive welfare state  and immigrants  social rights  to do this  we combine data from the european social survey with a unique regional dataset compiled from national censuses  eurostat  and the european election database  13 countries  114 regions  and 23 213 individuals   utilizing multilevel modeling  we find a negative relationship between regional percent foreign born and support for redistribution as well as between regional percent foreign born and support for a comprehensive welfare state  objective immigration  however  does not increase opposition to immigrants  social rights  i e  welfare chauvinism   we discuss the implications of these results and conclude that traditional welfare state attitudes and welfare chauvinism are distinct phenomena that should not be conflated in future research  
 immigration  occupations  and native wages  long time trends in the us the effect of immigration on the absorbing country is a major issue fueling public and academic debates  a foremost question is immigrants  impact on the native population s earnings  using american data from 1970 to 2010  i examined the effects of immigrant proportion in a given occupation on natives  earnings  i estimated two different types of multilevel models  a cross sectional and a lagged dependent model of the effect of changes in immigrants  occupational share on natives  wage growth  the findings suggest that occupations abundantly populated by immigrants are low wage occupations  however  in most years the increase in immigrants  occupational share was not related to a decline in natives  wages  these combined results cast doubt on immigration affecting native wages  and suggest that the negative view of immigration might be overstated  
 impacts of cash transfer programs on rural livelihoods  a case study in the brazilian amazon estuary we conducted a large household survey in a region of the amazon estuary in brazil to investigate the dependence of small farming households on government cash transfers and to identify the main factors that lead to better livelihood outcomes  the study examined the factors that contribute to heterogeneous household livelihoods and patterns of dependence on cash transfer programs  multinomial logistic regression was used to evaluate household attributes affecting the level of dependence on cash transfers  results indicate that households engage in a diversity of livelihood strategies  and vary in dependence on cash transfers  lower levels of dependency are associated with higher levels of education and income from off farm activities as well as larger property sizes and holdings in the varzea  recognition of the causes and potential range of dependence on cash transfer programs adds decision making capacity for policy makers seeking avenues to reduce dependence and increase program effectiveness  
 improving farmers markets and challenging neoliberalism in argentina although typically invisible  neoliberal policies and ideologies are often at the root of why farmers markets struggle to offer affordable prices for consumers  sufficient income for farmers  and expand socially and environmentally sustainable food systems  argentinian ferias francas  a variation on farmers markets  offer a unique case to examine how they may be designed to alleviate these issues by challenging neoliberalism through legislative mechanisms  ferias francas emerged as an explicitly anti neoliberal  grassroots response to argentina s expansion of neoliberal agricultural policies that stimulated global agribusiness and displaced small scale farmers  organizers partnered with municipal  provincial  and national governments to develop legislation to support small scale farmers and to make the network of ferias competitive with global agribusiness  i ask  how can organizers expand farmers markets  potential to fulfill the social and environmental goals of agri food movements  given neoliberal capitalism s constraints and contradictions  i analyze feria legislation by situating it in its social and historical context  and comparing legislative mechanisms to core elements of neoliberalism in the economy and in the everyday mentalities of agri food activists  i find that mechanisms such as setting prices lower than neighboring supermarkets and establishing uniform prices for feria goods contest some aspects of neoliberalism  however  the ferias also reproduce neoliberalism  and are still subject to the price standards set under the global neoliberal agroeconomy  raising questions about their prospects for sustainability under neoliberal capitalism  this analysis of feria legislation makes neoliberalism s influence on farmers markets visible and highlights legislative mechanisms that address some of its harmful effects  
 in between leaving and being left behind  mediating the mobilities and immobilities of indonesian non migrants in this article  i consider how and why some non migrants partially inhabit migrant subjectivities  based on ethnographic fieldwork conducted in central java  indonesia  i describe the experiences of those who embarked on pre departure migration processes  but failed to leave the country  men were often victims of fraud  women typically ran away from the confines of training centres  when redirected away from the border spaces of airports and recruitment centres  they typically identify themselves and are perceived by kin and neighbours as former  transnational migrants  i analyse how migration infrastructure   intersecting institutions  agents and technologies   produces such subjectivities in between conventional migrant and non migrant categories  these positions in between leaving and staying illuminate the infrastructural conditions that enable  constrain and mediate transnational mobilities  these cases of non departure show the expansive social and spatial effects of migration infrastructure beyond the facilitation of transnational movement  such less considered  im mobilities of non migrants point to the diverse ways in which migration institutions and agents mediate the circulation of persons between and within national borders  
 in the theater of political style  touches of populism  pluralism and elitism in speeches of politicians up to date  the concept of political style is underdeveloped  obstructing a profound understanding of political performances  this article disentangles the components of political style by analyzing the concept systematically  it is argued that instead of one single style  it has to be regarded as a cooperation of three styles  rhetorical  social and ideological  while approaches to reviewing rhetorical and social style are available  it lacks a method to assess ideological style  in this article  such a method is provided in a set of tools based on critical discourse studies  it defines ideological style in five traits that can be styled in a populist  elitist or pluralist manner  as an example  an ideological style analysis of six speeches of us politicians donald trump  bernie sanders and hillary clinton is performed  the analysis shows trump having a full populist style in these speeches  sanders a populist pluralist style and clinton an elitist pluralist style  comparison of the three individual style profiles gives a clarification of otherwise unexplained differences and similarities between the three politicians

 in home firearm access among us adolescents and the role of religious subculture  results from a nationally representative study religious participation is linked to numerous positive safety outcomes for adolescents  scant attention  however  has been paid to associations between religious participation and safety risks among adolescents  using data from add health  n   18 449   a nationally representative school based sample of us adolescents  this study examines the relationship between adolescents  religious affiliation and easy access to firearms at home  regression analyses adjust for complex sampling design and compare easy firearm access at home among conservative protestant adolescents to adolescent firearm access in other religious traditions  conservative protestant adolescents have a substantially greater likelihood of easy access to a gun at home compared to adolescents of all other major religious traditions in the united states  recognizing differences in adolescent firearm access between subcultural groups can help public health interventions more effectively identify and address the needs of vulnerable populations  the paper s conclusion considers suggestions for effective policy and programmatic initiatives   c  2017 elsevier inc  all rights reserved  
 in visible conflicts  ngos and the visual politics of humanitarian photography this article examines the diverse factors shaping the involvement of non governmental organisation  ngo  with humanitarian photography  paying particular attention to co operative relationships with photojournalists intended to facilitate the generation of visual coverage of crises otherwise marginalised  or ignored altogether  in mainstream news media  the analysis is primarily based on a case study drawing upon 26 semi structured interviews with ngo personnel  international red cross red crescent movement  oxfam and save the children  and photojournalists conducted over 2014 2016  securing original insights into the epistemic terms upon which ngos have sought to produce  frame and distribute imagery from recurrently disregarded crisis zones  in this way  the article pinpoints how the uses of digital imagery being negotiated by ngos elucidate the changing  stratified geopolitics of visibility demarcating the visual boundaries of newsworthiness  
 income inequality  economic growth  and subjective well being  evidence from china cross national and longitudinal studies have previously shown mixed results on income inequality and life satisfaction  as income inequality is associated with other social trends that may affect life satisfaction differentially  this article examines the impact of income inequality on subjective wellbeing in china  where sharply rising inequality has been accompanied by rapid economic growth over the past decades  based on a series of chinese general social survey  cgss  data  we show that life satisfaction increased from 2003 to 2010  despite a dramatic rise in income inequality during the same period  cross sectional analysis of the cgss in 2005  matched with prefectural level statistics  reveals that the local economic growth rate has a positive effect  but local income inequality has a negative effect  on individuals  life satisfaction  provincial panel data analysis further confirms the negative effect of income inequality on life satisfaction at the aggregate level  our findings help to clarify the mixed results in previous studies and point to the importance of both economic and social policies in improving subjective well being in china s transitional economy  
 increased educational attainment among us mothers and their children s academic expectations existing research provides strong evidence that children with more educated parents have higher academic expectations for themselves  but has yet to consider how an increase in the education of lower educated mothers might alter the expectations of their children  in light of the historic increase in u s  mothers  pursuit of additional education  this study investigates this timely question using data from a nationally representative  intergenerational sample of u s  children and mothers participating in the national longitudinal surveys of youth  n mothers    3265  n children    8027   combining random and fixed effects procedures  the findings revealed that an increase in mothers  educational attainment is linked to an increase in their children s expectations to earn a bachelor s degree  increased maternal education did not  however  buffer against the risk that children will downgrade these expectations upon approaching the end of high school  these results have theoretical importance to traditional models of status attainment  which typically view parental education as a stable feature of family background  extend a small but burgeoning literature that explores whether and why increased maternal education improves the mobility prospects of their children  and speak to current two generation policy approaches that aim to leverage trends in mothers education to reduce inequality for future generations  
 indeterminacy and more than human bodies  sites of experiment for doing politics differently this article analyses research that has explored the potential of a focus on indeterminate bodies for decision making  policy and politics  drawing on different ways of conceptualising indeterminacy in scientific and policy domains it describes the loweswater care project  a participatory knowledge collective  that attempted to avoid converting the complexities of vital cyanobacterial bodies into a purely social or managerial set of questions around water quality  through a commitment to opening out the nature of things   participants in this collective honed new questions and avenues of inquiry around cyanobacteria and its relations  the loweswater care project was a kind of open  in haraway s sense  where questions and demands are put to bodies  and to the apparatus that allows us to sense them  in ways that do not shy away from the probabilistic character of entities and their relations  the implications of generating indeterminacies in this setting are explored for environmental decision making  policy and politics  
 indeterminate bodies  introduction indeterminate bodies organizes a number of theoretical and empirical studies around the concept and actuality of indeterminacy  as it relates to body and society  located within the struggle to apprehend different categories of body  in the volatile flows of late capital  indeterminacy is considered through such multiple incarnations as economy  contingency  inheritance  question  force  uncertainty  materiality and affective resistance to determination  while indeterminacy is often positioned as the trouble  or friction in subject object knowledge formation  framed as ontological or empirical challenge   it also engenders affects such that some subjects are both in and out of recognition  questions of indeterminacy overlap with work on imperceptibility  giving rise to interlocked questions about the modes of representation  categorization  inclusion  exclusion and sensibility in the production of bodies  we address the hesitancies  difficulties and necessities of working with and through indeterminacy in order open up new descriptions  visions and modes of political work  
 indeterminate subjects  irreducible worlds  two economies of indeterminacy lodged in an impasse between questions of environmental justice and modes of capitalisation in the green economy  indeterminacy is a vulnerable and porous relation  pollution activates a potentiality in the organism to be otherwise  to generate certain kinds of tumours  mini deaths or mutations  toxicity has an intermediary status that launches a mobility of effects that is often fragmented through sense organs  affirming forms of non identity in biopolitical relations  organisms are receptive to such bodily reconfigurations precisely because they are open to the material communication of the world  in contrast to the hidden labour of indeterminacy in capitalist modes of capture  this article crafts an analytics of indeterminacy as an interjection in the politics of environments  through dispersants in the gulf of mexico and military bees  two economies of indeterminacy are discussed  drawing on georges bataille s notion of political economy  i argue that what is required is an economy of radical inequivalence  an excessive engagement with the possibilities of indetermining forces to make fleeting marks  
 indian country poverty  place based poverty on american indian territories  2006 10 this article examines place based poverty in indian country  emphasizing that reservation characteristics are influenced by the system of federal indian policy that affects american indian self determination and antipoverty strategies within reservation boundaries  using data from the american community survey five year file  2006 10  i model poverty rates using multivariate  nested regression along key dimensions associated with american indian antipoverty strategies and place based poverty  the results indicate that rates of female headed households and opportunity structures  such as lack of work  contribute to higher rates of reservation poverty while gaming acts as a slight buffer against poverty  surprisingly  natural resource related occupations  thought to be associated with expropriation of tribal resources  was not associated with higher poverty  while self governance compacts  acting as a proxy for tribal autonomy  had no significant impact on poverty rates  as tribal governments seek to address poverty through strategies enabled by self determination policies  there is a critical need for more comprehensive and reliable data to understand how and whether tribal governments can effectively adapt federal policies to specific reservation conditions  
 individual wealth and subjective financial well being in marriage  resource integration or separation  economic wealth is mostly assumed to be a household level resource that is pooled by spouses in married couples  using comprehensive data on the individual wealth of both spouses in married couples from the german socio economic panel study  n   13 623 individuals   the author tests this assumption  to this end  the associations between individuals  wealth and their spouses  wealth with individuals  subjective financial well being are examined  results show that women s financial well being is equally associated with their own individual wealth and their spouses  wealth in older birth cohorts  in younger birth cohorts  women s financial well being is more strongly associated with their own individual wealth than with their spouses  wealth  for men from all birth cohorts  their own individual wealth is more strongly related to their financial well being than is their spouses  wealth  these findings suggest that wealth is not generally and fully pooled and that individual ownership matters within married couples in germany  
 individualism and marriage  ideal types for making sense of the relationship between self and sacrifice the question of how the individual and group relate is one that has long interested social theorists  changes in family form and structure in the contemporary west resituate this question in a contentious public debate regarding how the prevalence of new family forms may contribute or be deleterious to the well being of individuals and families  sociological discourse on marriage and the family generally tends to mirror this debate by dichotomizing individualism and commitment and self and marriage  resulting in an obfuscation of our understanding of the forms and styles in marriage  in order to clarify and advance this discussion  we show how individualism and commitment are mutually required in a modern world  we follow this by outlining a logically derived typology that  along with a committed individualist and a group conformer  includes two intermediate types  a self regulator and a relationship negotiator  we empirically demonstrate the utility of these types by showing how they correspond with the ways that interviewees talk about marriage in six local congregations  and we suggest various social factors that may particularly impact the development of local marriage cultures  these types provide a theoretical frame for understanding how individualism and commitment are intertwined and require each other  
 inequality frames  how teachers inhabit color blind ideology this paper examines how public school teachers take up  modify  or resist the dominant ideology of color blind racism  this examination is based on in depth interviews with 60 teachers at three segregated schools  one was race class privileged and two were disadvantaged  inductive coding revealed that teachers at each school articulated a shared frame to talk about race and class  legitimated advantage at heritage high school  trickle down dysfunction at bunker high school  and antiracist dignity at solidarity high school  each represents an inequality frame  a local meaning system that mediates the dominant race class ideology  arising from teachers  shared experiences of inequality in the school as workplace  the frames i observed responded to three organizational conditions that affected teachers  experiences of inequality  school demographics  material resources  and professional culture  variations in these conditions across schools provided opportunity spaces for teachers to either accept race class domination as common sense or to critique it  
 information and communication technology and ethnic conflict in myanmar  organizing for violence or peace  objective  in a country as historically conflict ridden as myanmar  will the reduced communication costs yielded by the recent expansion of mobile telephony create political affordances that make collective organization for peace or violence more likely to prevail  method  applying a random effects model of time series cross sectional data  we test the relationship shared by ethnic groups  increasing access to mobile telephony and their incidence of violent conflict against the state  by comparing differences in the effect across two distinct periods of time before and after mobile phones became widely available we can conduct robust tests of this relationship  results  the results of the analysis offer only marginal support for the prediction that increased access to mobile phones amplified groups  incidence of violence against the state  more often  the direction of the effect traveled in the opposite direction  suggesting that the spread of mobile phones possibly served as a pacifying force for certain ethnic groups  conclusions  within the context of myanmar  the expansion of mobile telephony has not encouraged greater violence and may instead serve as a pacifying force  
 inglehart s scarcity hypothesis revisited  is postmaterialism a macro  or micro level phenomenon around the world  inglehart s theory of postmaterialism hinged on the scarcity hypothesis  according to which the spread of postmaterialist values depends on the degree of individuals  and societies  existential security  rooted in macro level economic conditions  but does a country s level of economic development systematically shape individuals  existential security  and thus postmaterialism  in this article  the authors revisit this question by utilizing 2010 2014 world values survey data for testing whether the effect of existential security on postmaterialism varies by macro conditions across 59 countries representing 72  of the world s population  based on multilevel models  the authors find strong effects of individuals  socioeconomic conditions on postmaterialism  confirming one aspect of the scarcity hypothesis  but also find weak associations between the effects of those conditions by economic factors at the national level  while there is substantial cross national variation in the effect of individual scarcity  that variation cannot be accounted for by the macro conditions predicted by the theory  
 insights and directions for sociological approaches to saving  the case of a financial education programme for children in portugal the recent contexts of financial and economic crises have fostered discourses and initiatives for encouraging people to save  despite there being  for the sake of sustainability  a generalized support to educational measures for increasing savings from early childhood  a complete understanding of why and how people save has not yet been attained  the absence of sociological attention to the engagement of consumers in such financial decisions is particularly scant  this article takes the case study of a financial education programme for children to suggest future directions for the sociological investigation of savings  literature review and the analysis of a portuguese programme revealed a clear absence of sociological insights in financial education programmes  contents and procedures  however  sociological research has already come to relevant findings about social aspects and processes of financial decisions that allow for a better understanding of how consumers  and children in particular  learn about and behave in relation to money  consumption and savings  in our view  the study of savings should pay more attention to several adjoining  concurrent and complimentary practices encompassed in the consumption process  this article contributes not only to fill in the literature gaps identified by the study  but also to counter offer non judgemental research regarding current literature on the subject  
 integrated multi dimensional design a plea for a broader perspective in mixed methods research in political science while mixed methods designs can in principle combine a large variety of methods  the de facto standard in political science is currently a combination of case studies with regression analysis  to broaden this perspective  we introduce an integrated multi dimensional mixed methods design in which several methods are used to address different dimensions of one overarching research question  we demonstrate the usefulness of this approach in a case study on the changing legitimation of economic regimes  in this case study a combination of descriptive statistics  discourse network analysis and narrative analysis is used to answer the question whether the post 2008 financial crisis has led to a legitimation crisis of the current capitalist economic regime  
 intergenerational relations before and after offspring arrive  a within person investigation the birth of a child may re orientate the relations between adult children and their parents  however  the previous studies on the topic are both scarce and methodologically limited  the current study investigates whether younger adults  entry into parenthood  i e   the birth of the first child  is associated with increased contact frequency  emotional closeness  intimacy and conflict with their own parents  the participants are from the german panel analysis of intimate relationships and family dynamics  which is a prospective survey of younger adults with six annual follow up waves between 2009 and 2014  n   17 662 person observations from 4821 persons   within person regression with a focus on each individual s variation over time was used to detect changes in intergenerational relations  the contact frequency between daughters and mothers increased after the arrival of their first child  in contrast  the emotional closeness and intimacy between sons and mothers decreased after the birth of their first child  the results are discussed with reference to gender based differences in intergenerational relations   c  2017 elsevier inc  all rights reserved  
 intergenerational social mobility in spain between 1956 and 2011  the role of educational expansion and economic modernisation in a late industrialised country this article explores intergenerational class mobility patterns and the role played by education in spain using counterfactuals  both men and women born from 1926 to 1981 are analysed  meaning the study covers a period of profound economic and educational advances in a late industrialised country  the results suggest that  among the cohorts born in the 1970s  men have experienced a slight increase in social fluidity  while women have experienced a substantial increase that seems partially driven by their massively increased access to routine non manual positions independent of their social origins  inequality of educational opportunities and class returns to education have declined  whereas the direct effect of social origins  deso  has remained constant for men and has decreased considerably for women  the counterfactual analysis shows that the slight increase in social fluidity for men is mainly driven by educational expansion  for women  the deso and educational expansion account for a great share of increasing fluidity  therefore  certain assumptions made by the modernization theory and goldthorpe s theory of social mobility can be put into question  
 intergenerational transmission of parent child relationship quality  evidence from a multi actor survey intergenerational transmission is a long standing interest of social science research  however  little attention has been devoted to the study of transmission of relationship quality between several generations of family members  exploiting multigenerational multi actor data from the german family panel  pairfam   we estimate multilevel models to investigate whether  in three generation families  relationship quality between the middle generation and the oldest  that is  grandparent  generation predicts relationship quality between the youngest generation of adolescent children and the middle generation  our results reveal evidence of intergenerational transmission of emotional closeness  conflict  and ambivalence  transmission was more consistently observed when emanating from ties to grandfathers than from ties to grandmothers  a hypothesis concerning differences in the strength of transmission between east germany and west germany found no support  the paper concludes with a discussion of limitations and perspectives for future research   c  2017 elsevier inc  all rights reserved  
 international collaboration in social sciences and humanities  inclusion  participation and integration the generation of scientific knowledge now responds to a primordially collaborative schema that gradually transitions from the institutional to the international  social sciences and humanities in latin america have joined this trend  however  their international collaboration has been oriented toward an asymmetric schema in terms of inclusion  only one sector of countries has joined  while another significant group remains isolated  participation  interactions are concentrated by countries with more written science  and integration  it tends to a north south type of collaboration  the analysis of latin american international scientific dialogue considers the period of 2005 2015 and it is used redalyc  org database for its representation in the disciplinary and regional  starting from a universe of 10 332 interactions among researchers in the region  it is concluded that these trends of international collaboration are emerging as effects of the current system of communication and evaluation of science  
 international solidarity and ethnic boundaries  using the israeli palestinian conflict to strengthen ethno national claims in northern ireland while scholars have described vertical nation building narratives that genealogically anchor a specific group to a specific territory  smith 1981  eriksen 2002   i argue that  in addition to vertical strategies  expressions of international solidarity constitute horizontal nation building strategies  expressions of international solidarity can be used to maintain local ethnic boundaries and reinforce local divisions  by adopting an ally  expressions of international solidarity also designate an adversary  making the boundary between the two a possible incentive for solidarity  in northern ireland  some unionist and nationalist political entrepreneurs rely on expressions of international solidarity with israelis or palestinians  respectively  to make adversarial ethno national claims to the nation state  this study examines flags  graffiti  murals and political speech on display in northern ireland that advocate for either israelis or palestinians  through the concept of borrowed legitimacy   i acknowledge the strategic use of the ethnic boundary in expressions of international solidarity  
 internet enabled access to alternative food networks  a comparison of online and offline food shoppers and their differing interpretations of quality online food retail has the potential to broaden access to systems of food provision which promote social and environmental quality attributes  this possibility is explored using data from a survey of 365 consumers who purchased food either via internet retailers of local and organic food  or via farmers  markets  in vancouver  canada and melbourne  australia  survey results are analyzed using principal component and regression techniques and interpreted via the theoretical framework of conventions theory  key findings show that while online retailers of local organic food are not currently attracting more resource constrained consumers  they do appeal to a similar  although broader  array of quality conventions  this research provides new insights into the challenges and opportunities associated with increasing consumer access to alternative food networks  as well as adding to the small number of quantitative studies in the conventions theory literature  
 interpreting media content post conflict  communications of  travel  and  bosnia and herzegovina  in us newspapers  20 years post dayton this study looks at the role the media plays in how a destination is communicated over time post conflict   by considering how discourses longitudinally brand a destination  bosnia and herzegovina  bih  was the centre of a violent conflict in the early 1990s  the war ended with the signing of the dayton agreement  much of the conflict  and especially the siege of sarajevo  was captured by the media  the representation of the bosnian war established a negative imagination of the new country  resulting initially in a hesitancy to travel to a war torn destination  this paper suggests place repression  fading memory and destination redefining as a framework to analyse media content and brand a post conflict destination  in the years following the agreement  there was no discussion promoting travel to bih  after 2000  travel was still advised against but the narrative began to change and promote the destination by discussing the past and present situation  post 2000 content reduced significantly but stories promoting travel increased after 2003 with more extended narratives promoting travel and new opportunities for branding the destination  
 intersectionality and the role of white women  an analysis of divorce petitions from slavery research on sexual violence and rape during slavery often focuses on the dynamic between white men and black women  however  white women played an important intermediate role in the sexual violence of enslaved black women  analyzing divorce petitions submitted during slavery  the unique role of white women and their responses to sexual violence carried out by their husbands offer additional depth to the discussion of rape of enslaved black women  furthermore  this analysis adds to intersectionality theory with the concept of a web of intersectional incentives  tactics  and consequences that encourage the maintenance of oppression

 intimacy and intergenerational relations in rural china this article applies the concept of intimacy to examine relationships between adult children and their parents in rural china   an area which has been predominantly located in an obligatory framework  i reveal a qualitative difference in support between relationships built on intimate ties and those bound by duty and obligation  a unilateral emphasis on obligation based relationships can deprive both the parent and adult child generations of agency and autonomy  which can be disempowering for both  the complex relations between intimacy and obligation are the product of local socio economic circumstances and gender norms  although traditional patrilineal and patrilocal culture excludes married daughters from the filial discourse surrounding their own parents  they are often considered to have the most intimate relationship with their parents  paradoxically  the practices of intimacy between aged parents and their married daughters strengthen the natal ties that facilitate modifications to patrilocal and patrilineal customs  
 intraparty democracy and responsiveness to rival parties  policies objective  we address whether intraparty democracy conditions political parties  responsiveness to rival parties  policy shifts  method  we estimate parameters of a spatial econometric model of parties  policy positions in 11 established democracies  results  internally democratic parties respond to shifts in rival parties  policies  and internally undemocratic parties do not respond to rival parties  policy shifts  conclusion  we argue that this occurs because intraparty deliberation provides a channel through which rival parties influence their competitors  policies  because rank and file party members are influenced by deliberative processes more than party leaders and the policy goals of internally democratic parties  policies are heavily influenced by their party members deliberative processes lead democratic parties to respond to shifts in rival parties  policy positions  this work has important implications for our understanding of parties  election strategies  intraparty politics  and how policies diffuse between parties competing in the same election

 invoices on scraps of paper  trust and reciprocity in local food systems one of the many claims about the value of local food is that local food exchanges generate trust between producers and consumers  to what degree is this actually the case and how does such trust develop  drawing on interview and fieldwork data in one local food system in the northeastern u s   i show how local food participants  particularly farms and food retailers  build trust and reciprocity with one another in order to mitigate the challenges imposed by the conventional system  this trust and reciprocity builds primarily through three mechanisms  reliable  positive relationships  demonstrations of good will toward one another  and a shared understanding of the value of locally oriented food  through these mechanisms  local food operators are able to build a healthy  stable local food system  able to better resist the pressures of the conventional system in which it must continually operate  
 involving nonresident lithuanian fathers in child rearing  the negative impact of income inequalities and sociolegal policies using nationally representative data on nonresident fathers  this study examines father child contact and child support payments in lithuania  we focus on previously married and cohabiting fathers whose parenting rights and obligations are organized differently by lithuanian legislation  our findings demonstrate that previously cohabiting fathers  involvement in child rearing is more significantly associated with levels of individual income resources rather than family formation type  we argue that legal uncertainties linked to nonmarital fatherhood reinforce the inequalities of men s paternal rights and place previously cohabiting fathers  particularly with low socioeconomic resources  in disadvantaged positions  moreover  we argue based on international evidence that universal social policies to support fathers  social citizenship rights before separation and across household or family types  including greater individualization of lithuania s generous parental leave provisions  would encourage father child contact for low socioeconomic fathers following cohabitation dissolution and reduce traditional male breadwinning barriers to father child contact  
 is blindness contagious  examining racial attitudes among people of color with close interracial relationships are people of color with close relationships with whites more likely to embrace colorblind racial ideologies  cbri   using restricted data from waves 1 and 2 of the portraits of american life study  n   2 713   collected in 2006 and 2012  we test whether black  latina o  and asian respondents are more likely to express colorblind racial attitudes if they have an intimate partner or close friends who are white  we use ordinal logit models to examine seven cbri attitudinal items  controlling for the respondent s socioeconomic characteristics  immigrant generation  national origin  gender  age  characteristics of the city  and region  although black  latina o  and asian respondents are less likely to express cbri than whites are  respondents of color with close relationships with whites are more likely to minimize certain types of racism  even after controlling for other characteristics of the individual  we discuss the implications of these findings  considering the patterns of antiblack and anti immigrant attitudes among groups of color and placing them in the context of the more negative attitudes often expressed by whites  we also describe how other demographic patterns in these attitudes could shape future trends in attitudes and suggest possible interventions  
 is category spanning truly disadvantageous  new evidence from primary and secondary movie markets genre assignments help audiences make sense of new releases  studies from a wide range of market contexts have shown that generalists defying clear mapping to established categories suffer penalties in market legitimacy  perceived quality  or audience attention  we introduce an empirical strategy to disentangle two mechanisms  reduced niche fitness and audience confusion  causing devaluation or ignorance of boundary crossing offers  our data on 2 971 feature films released to us theaters and subsequently made available on dvd further reveal that consequences of category spanning are subject to strong moderating influences  negative effects are far from universal  manifesting only if  a  combined genres are culturally distant   b  products are released to a stable and highly institutionalized market context  and  c  offers lack familiarity as an alternative source of market recognition  our study provides ramifications as to the scope conditions of categorization effects and modifies some widely acknowledged truisms regarding boundary crossing in cultural markets  
 is communication a mechanism of relationship education effects among rural african americans  enhancing communication as a means of promoting relationship quality has been increasingly questioned  particularly for couples at elevated sociodemographic risk  in response  the current study investigated communication change as a mechanism accounting for changes in relationship satisfaction and confidence among 344 rural  predominantly low income african american couples with an early adolescent child who participated in a randomized controlled trial of the protecting strong african american families  prosaaf  program  approximately 9 months after baseline assessment  intent to treat analyses indicated that prosaaf couples demonstrated improved communication  satisfaction  and confidence when compared with couples in the control condition  improvements in communication mediated prosaaf effects on relationship satisfaction and confidence  conversely  neither satisfaction nor confidence mediated intervention effects on changes in communication  these results underscore the short term efficacy of a communication focused  culturally sensitive prevention program and suggest that communication is a possible mechanism of change in relationship quality among low income african american couples  
 is economic policy uncertainty related to suicide rates  evidence from the united states while it has long been recognised that periods of economic uncertainty  characterised by increased unemployment and lower economic activity  are associated with increased suicide rates  no study has examined the impact of policy related economic uncertainty on suicide mortality  the aim of this study is to examine the relationship between economic policy uncertainty and suicide mortality in the united states over the period 1950 2013   while controlling for several other socioeconomic determinants of suicide mortality  as well as age  and gender variations  the results of the analysis reveal that increased economic policy uncertainty is associated with increased suicide mortality of the youngest and the oldest segments of the male population in the united states  while the female population across all ages is found to be resilient to changes in economic policy uncertainty  
 is ethnic prejudice declining in britain  change in social distance attitudes among ethnic majority and minority britons most literature on racial prejudice deals with the racial attitudes of the ethnic majority and ethnic minorities separately  this paper breaks this tradition  we examine the social distance attitudes of white and non white british residents to test if these attitudes follow the same trends over time  whether they are driven by the same social processes and whether they are inter related  we have three main findings  firstly  social distance from other ethnic groups has declined over time for both white and ethnic minority britons  for the white majority there are both period and cohort elements to this decline  secondly  we see some evidence that social distance between the majority and minority groups is reciprocal  specifically  minorities who experience rejection by the white british feel a greater sense of distance from them  thirdly  we find that all groups share the perception of the same ethnic hierarchy  we see evidence of particularly widespread hostility towards muslim britons from all ethnic groups suggesting that muslims are singled out for negative attention from many british residents of all other backgrounds  including a large number who do not express hostility to other groups  
 it s been mostly about money  a multi method research approach to the sources of institutionalization although much has been written about the process of party system institutionalization in different regions  the reasons why some party systems institutionalize while others do not still remain a mystery  seeking to fill this lacuna in the literature  and using a mixed methods research approach  this article constitutes a first attempt to answer simultaneously the following three questions   1  what specific factors help party systems to institutionalize  or not    2  what are the links  in terms of time and degree  as well as the causal mechanisms behind such relationships  and  3  how do they affect a particular party system  in order to do so  this article focuses on the study of party system development and institutionalization in 13 postcommunist democracies between 1990 and 2010  methodologically  the article innovates in five respects  first  it continues the debate on the importance of mixed methods when trying to answer different research questions  second  it adds to the as yet brief literature on the combination of process tracing and qualitative comparative analysis  third  it constitutes the first attempt to date to use a most similar different outcome most different same outcome procedure in order to reduce causal complexity before undertaking a crisp set qualitative comparative analysis  third  it also shows the merits of combining both congruence and process tracing in the same comparative study  finally  it also develops a novel bipolar comparative method to explain the extent to which opposite outcomes are determined by reverse conditions and conflicting intervening causal forces  
 jackfruit seeds from jharkhand  being adivasi in assam this article examines how adivasis in assam assert their sense of belonging to the land  based on ethnographic fieldwork conducted along the foothills bordering assam and nagaland  i present the everyday lives of adivasi villagers in a militarised landscape and examine how adivasi belonging and identity are constructed in a political milieu where ideas of indigeneity and territoriality are deeply internalised  i look into how adivasi accounts highlight the weaving together of the histories of the tea plantations and social alliances with neighbours in the villages  i argue that these narratives are used to assert rights and claim an identity of belonging  specifically focusing on adivasi accounts situated outside the tea plantations in assam  this article seeks to contribute towards scholarship about everyday practices of belonging  memory and social relations in northeast india and beyond  
 jewish theology in germany  the co existence of secular and religious discourse how often do secular and religious discourses communicate and interrelate at points where they intersect in society  when the science of judaism  wissenschaft des judentums  evolved at the beginning of the nineteenth century  it intended  through both theological and secular studies  to demonstrate the general value of jewish culture and civilization  although denied a place in the public university system until after the shoah  jewish studies departments have since been established at various german universities  and  in 2013  the school of jewish theology of the university of potsdam was opened as the first jewish divinity school in the history of the german university system  with this  what was once a utopian dream became a reality  and both branches of the science of judaism  religious and secular  became undisputed parts of the german academic scene  using similar tools for differing aims  two prime examples of the intersection of the secular and religious in germany today are the proliferation of divinity schools at state universities  on the one hand  and the development of military chaplaincy in the armed forces  on the other  both of these  through contractual agreements  aim to regulate and facilitate religious pluralism within a secular state  while the one has already begun to take place  the other is currently under discussion

 just existing is resisting  the everyday struggle against the expansion of gm crops in spain the attempt to have coexistence between organic  conventional and genetically modified  gm  crops has generated unresolved frictions between agro food models based on different practices  values  worldviews and cultures  this article explores forms of everyday resistance that have emerged against the domineering power and spread of gm maize in spain  the gateway nation for gm crops in europe  drawing on multi sited ethnographic work and interviews  we describe six practices by which social actors throughout the agro food system are resisting the expansion of gm maize and forming some unlikely alliances  we conclude that a myriad of practical resistance actions are taking place  from actors in both alternative and conventional food systems  as they fight for their survival against the political power and uncontrolled biological spread of gm crops  these practices challenge the regulatory concept of the possibility of a harmonious coexistence between the systems and highlight how an everyday struggle is required for non gm maize actors to continue to exist

 justice concerns after school attacks  belief in a just world and support for perpetrator punishment among chinese adults and adolescents school attacks against children seriously threaten the belief that the world is a just place  in which good people get rewarded and bad people get punished  however  to what extent and in which way belief in a just world  bjw  plays a role in reaction to school attacks have not been investigated  especially in the chinese context  in which people are traditionally expected to prize harmony over justice  two studies examined how chinese people varying in bjw differ in supporting punishment for the perpetrators of school attacks in china in 2010  in study 1  general bjw among chinese adults predicted support for perpetrator punishment  and those who paid more attention to the crime news also reported a higher level of punishment support  study 2 revealed a similar pattern among chinese adolescents  whose previously measured higher general bjw predicted increasing support for perpetrator punishment  and this effect was mediated via personal distress  in summary  general just world belief facilitates punishment support among parents and adolescents in the chinese context

 keeping out and getting in  reframing emergency department gatekeeping as structural competence sociologists have tended to frame medical gatekeeping as an exclusionary social practice  delineating how practitioners and clerical staff police the moral boundaries of medicine by keeping out patients who are categorised as bad   deviant   or otherwise problematic  yet medical gatekeeping  understood more broadly  can include not only keeping patients out of particular clinical settings  but also redirecting them to alternative sources of care  in this article  i draw on qualitative analysis of audio recorded patient provider interactions in a united states emergency department  ed  to illustrate medical gatekeeping as a two step process of  first  categorising certain patient complaints as unsuitable for treatment within a particular setting  and second  diverting patients to alternative sites for care  i refer to these as the restrictive and facilitative components of medical gatekeeping to denote how each relates to patients  access to care  recognising that both components of medical gatekeeping are part of a coordinated organisational strategy for managing resource scarcity  by illustrating how ed providers reveal intimate knowledge of structural vulnerabilities in diverting socioeconomically disadvantaged patients with chronic back pain to clinical sites that are better equipped to provide care  i suggest that we rethink the emphasis on restrictive practices in sociological accounts of medical gatekeeping  
 knowing death well  intimate and contextual death competence among end of life laborers end of life workers  regardless of occupational status  work against a transformed culture of death and dying  against that backdrop of technological brinkmanship  segregation of aging and dying from other aspects of life  and a cultural denial of death s inevitability  end of life workers develop competence and expertise  however  that competence varies  shaped by the training and occupational status of its purveyors  based on three years of participant observation and interviews with end of life laborers  i identify two types of death competenceintimate and contextualthat develop at different levels of the occupational hierarchy  one situates death philosophically and morally  the other garners insight from the body to sustain elders  personhood in the face of diminishing capacities  these ways of knowing are valuable in a death denying culture  surfacing the less apparent expertise of nurse s aides also contributes to existing social theory about death competence and raises questions about occupational knowledge more generally  
 knowledge equity is social justice  engaging a practice theory perspective of knowledge for rural transformation social inequities are made possible by and compounded by knowledge inequity  accordingly  new and more vehicles are needed in which different and transformative knowledges can chart new possibilities  practices  and meanings for rural people  one way forward is to work toward an ecology of knowledges in which the need for many types of knowledge is recognized and different knowledges are respected  drawing on case study and photo voice research with women in rural ethiopia  this article uses a practice theory approach to explore the possibilities of knowledge dialogue among different types of knowledge and skill  recognizing the wide spectrum of deep knowledge and skill employed in local practice  and understanding how all knowledges are rooted in social context  actors can find common ground to dialogue through methods of praxis and narrative  
 labor and domination  worker control in a chinese factory china s export led manufacturing model has been built on extensive exploitation of its migrant workforce under a despotic labor regime  but the methods of control have shifted considerably during the past decade and a half  this article examines new modes of domination over chinese factory workers  based on fieldwork conducted while the author was living with workers at a foreign invested garment factory in southern china  the article shows how mechanisms to control the workers are embedded today not only in directly coercive practices but also in a new shop floor culture with affective personal ties and implicit bargaining in wage systems  against the scholarly literature of management controls that emphasizes rupture and discontinuity between labor regimes  this article argues that china s emerging labor regime  here referred to as conciliatory despotism  inherits despotic features of the labor regime exercised in the 1990s but adds new normative measures of soft control that seek to conciliate worker resentments  this hybrid form of management control represents a stage in china s evolving labor management relations in which workers possess more implicit power and can push management into greater concessions than previously  
 labor market disparities between african americans and afro caribbeans  reexamining the role of immigrant selectivity black immigrants from the caribbean have long attained greater labor market success than african americans  the most recent studies show that afro caribbeans have earnings that are approximately 16  greater than african americans and that afro caribbeans are as much as 21  more likely to be employed than african americans  the most prominent explanation for greater afro caribbean success is that  because they have chosen to migrate  afro caribbeans are positively self selected on characteristics that are key for success in the u s  labor market  proponents of immigrant selectivity argue that migrants have greater levels of both hard and soft skills than nonmigrants  using data from the national survey of american life the first social survey to provide a nationally representative sample of both african americans and afro caribbeans this study finds that afro caribbeans have greater hard skills than african americans but split the difference on two measures of soft skills  african americans and afro caribbeans are matched on john henryism  but african americans have greater personal mastery than afro caribbeans  contrary to expectations  controlling for differences in hard and soft skills does not provide for a meaningful reduction in labor market disparities between african americans and afro caribbeans  
 labor migration and the missing work of homemaking  three forms of settling for chinese canadian migrants much of migration theory has come to revolve around the category of the  labor migrant   without taking into account labor  like homemaking  that remains unrecognized by the market  drawing from qualitative interviews with thirty one chinese migrants in different stages of making a move from beijing to vancouver  we attempt to bring better visibility to how the labor involved in homemaking intersects with migration  defining homemaking as work in the pragmatic existentialist context of the stabilization of everyday routines  we uncover three themes to homemaking work  settling in  settling down  and settling for  discussion of these themes reveals two important issues for migration theory  settlement relies upon the work of homemaking and the work of homemaking in many cases motivates migration  for these reasons  the work of homemaking should be more carefully studied within the migration literature  
 landing a job  sinking a career  the trade off between occupational downgrading and quick reemployment according to unemployed jobseekers  career stage and job prospects a critical aspect of individual careers is the quality of jobs the unemployed match to at reemployment  the present study examines a trade off the unemployed face in occupationally segmented labor markets  quickly exiting unemployment via downgraded reemployment or holding out for a skill adequate job while remaining unemployed  we analyze how the likelihood of involuntary status downgrading relates to the relative availability of  best fit  vacancies at particular stages of a career  this study thus contributes to the broader literature on scar effects incurred from the experience of unemployment  another contribution is the construction of refined measures of accessible vacancies at the micro level  proportional hazard rate models are estimated using an inflow sample  2006 2014  of unemployed men with vocational education in switzerland  our results show that a higher relative availability of  best fit  vacancies lowers jobseekers  risk of taking up a lower prestige job than the one sought  career stage also matters for the trade off between the quality and speed of reemployment  with trial stage unemployed being most responsive to job prospects  
 language as a public good and national identity  scotland s competing heritage languages the preservation of one or several historically and culturally important languages may be a salient political issue in some polities  although they may not be used as an active means of communication  these languages can also serve a symbolic identitary function  these heritage  languages can be seen as public goods  and that even non speakers of these languages can have opinions regarding their importance to national identity  in the scotland example  while gaelic has been the focus of proactive government legislation and education initiatives  scots is still struggling for status as a recognised language  both languages are in some way constituent parts of scottish identity that at times may seem in competition with one another  using original survey data  we delve deeper into questions of language  identity and politics in scotland  first  we describe how public opinion is divided over the importance of gaelic and scots to scottish identity  second  we use attitudes towards these languages as a dependent variable looking at scottish identity and attachment  finally  we use these attitudes towards gaelic and scots as an independent variable in models for party identification in scotland  
 latino students and white migration from school districts  1980 2010 we use three decades of data from u s  school districts to assess the association between latino school age populations and net migration of non latino white residents  our results indicate that growing latino student populations are associated with declining net migration among whites  this pattern is particularly strong in non traditional latino districts  where the presence of latinos is historically recent  in districts that are spatially proximate to those with smaller latino populations  and in districts marked by relatively low internal segregation  these findings apply primarily to whites with the closest ties to public schools  school age children and  parent age  adults between the ages of 30 and 49  suggesting that whites  selective migration is linked to preferences for public schools with smaller latino student populations  
 legal medicine in france  an occupational group segmented between judicial expertise and medical specialty en   this paper questions forensic reports of victims of sexual violence and the relations between police officers  who ask for those reports  and the forensic doctors who write them  the analysis distinguishes two cases  when the report mentions the existence of lesions  and when it doesn t  this last case might disrupt the relations between forensic doctors and police officers  and highlights the existence of two different ways of seeing the victim among those two occupational groups  
 legality  racialization  and immigrants  experience of ethnoracial harassment in russia using data from a structured survey and in depth interviews in three russian cities  our study engages the scholarship on immigration legal regimes and racialization practices to examine the experiences of ethnoracially motivated harassment among working migrant women from kyrgyzstan  tajikistan  and uzbekistan in russia  the results of statistical analyses show that regularized legal status is associated with a significantly lower likelihood of experiencing harassment at the hands of law enforcement agents and other actors alike  regardless of legal status  however  the analyses reveal significant variations across the three migrant groups  with members of the group that is seen as racially most distinct from the host population having the highest odds of reporting harassment  the analysis of in depth interviews confirms and expands on these patterns  providing additional insights into the complex expressions and interplay of legality and race in migrants  everyday experiences  the study findings are situated within the cross national literature on migrants  legal and ethnoracial exclusion in receiving contexts

 lessons on the boundaries of belonging  racialization and symbolic boundary drawing in the french civic integration program national civic integration programs for non european migrants have become increasingly common across europe  while the official purpose of these programs is to facilitate migrants  entry into society  scholars argue that they may actually reinforce the boundaries that separate migrants from the national community  to address this potential paradox  i propose a theoretical framework that combines the concepts of racialization and symbolic boundaries and effectively locates integration programs in the long historical relationship between europeans and non europeans  in applying this framework  this article draws on an ethnography of the french civic integration program   the  reception and integration contract    and interviews with program staff  i find that the program represents the french nation as modern  secular  and striving towards gender equality  and immigrants as traditional with patriarchal gender relations and public religious practices that conflict with the values of the french republic  using these representations  the program discursively draws racialized boundaries between the french nation and participating migrants based on language  culture  and religion  while program personnel with immigrant origins challenge and blur these boundaries  they also often reinforce them and facilitate this process of racialization  overall  the essentialist and hierarchical representations within the program discourses appear to reproduce the historical contrast between european and non european and limit the possibilities for boundary crossing and entry into the nation  
 let people be people  everyday substance use in a public work site this article complicates the prevailing portrait of substance use as being incompatible with work  drawing on in depth ethnographic data of one informal economic zone collected over a four year period between january 2010 and january 2014  i expose the daily interactions through which substance use becomes compatible with work and the mechanisms by which drug and alcohol use become embedded in the local ecology of a public work site  to capture the ways in which people link their substance use to their experience of work  i utilize three concepts taking a break  maintaining a cycle  and tipping the balance each of which is suggestive of different patterned relationships between substance use and work in public  data indicate that people link their substance use to their work in different ways and with different consequences and that each of these patterned relationships becomes an interrelated part of a single social system  these findings add necessary nuance and complexity to substance use literature  which is more frequently focused on abject abuse and disorder  and provide a more complete understanding of the ways in which substance use practices become linked to urban economies  furthermore  they illuminate how participation in informal economic activity can play a variety of roles in the lives of people engaged in substance use practices  
 let s talk politics  which individual and classroom compositional characteristics matter in classroom discussions  deliberative democratic theory puts discussions at the centre of democracy  schools are places where young people can practise such discussions  in this article  we argue that these perceptions of deliberation in class are differential for different young people  individual student characteristics matter when making schools successful in creating an open discussion climate   using the international civic and citizenship education study  iccs  2009  we find that gender  self efficacy and socio economic background have an impact on the perception of such a climate  if students evaluate discussion opportunities differently based on background characteristics  alternate strategies should be developed to get everyone to deliberate  future research looking into the quality of discussions should take this into account  as boys or students with a lower ses  socio economic status  might need extra stimulation to perceive the classroom as a place to discuss public matters  also  schools and policymakers should be aware when deciding which civic education strategy should be followed to obtain the desired results  
 liberal intolerance in european education debates the reaction against non western immigrants and especially muslims has been analysed both in terms of an exclusionary civic nationalism and in terms of an assertive liberalism  similar to exclusionary civic nationalism  assertive liberalism purports to defend liberal democratic principles and society against illiberal principles and forces predominantly represented by muslims  this article argues that nationalism and liberalism are analytically distinguishable but difficult to disentangle empirically  it contends that a more detailed analysis of assertive liberalism can be obtained by subdividing it into four categories of liberal intolerance and demonstrates this by analysing six national debates on the accommodation of cultural and religious diversity in education  the analysis indicates that the nature of liberal intolerance understood as the combination of the four categories of liberal intolerance varies with the state tradition regarding religious neutrality of public institutions and the type of welfare state  but also that many liberal arguments for and against accommodation repeat themselves across national contexts  
 literacy as social  media  practice  refugee youth and native language literacy at school research indicates that immigrant and refugee students benefit from use of their native languages in education  nevertheless  what this means in practice has infrequently been examined by researchers  and teachers often struggle to find ways to use their refugee students  native languages as resources that encourage the development of the native languages as well as academic language and literacy in the new language  this small scale  exploratory project employed an innovative  five day critical media literacy curricular unit  and then examined how it served as a context for native language and english literacy development  participants were 14 adolescent newcomers to the u s  from somalia  kenya  djibouti  and ethiopia  all speakers of somali with limited or interrupted formal schooling experiences  participants had varying but mostly beginning levels of print literacy skills  yet as recent migrants  most used social media to interact with others locally and globally  in multiple languages  oral and written  as described here  our efforts to foster peer to peer somali language communication resulted in multilingual interaction across a range of social and academic purposes in the classroom  these research findings highlight how in class use of social media analysis can serve to achieve multilingual and  critical  literacy learning aims  
 liveable villages  the relationship between volunteering and liveability in the perceptions of rural residents in the dutch policy discourse it is increasingly thought that active citizenship will positively affect satisfaction with the living environment  this article challenges this assumption by examining whether and how volunteering in village life and individual perceptions of liveability are interrelated  through a series of hierarchical regressions  we found that having the opportunity to volunteer in village life is not a significant predictor of perceived liveability  moreover  by classifying rural inhabitants as non participants  nominal participants and active participants in volunteering in village life  we determined that active residents evaluate liveability less positively than the other two groups  accordingly  determinants other than volunteering and active citizenship are better able to predict perceived liveability  although the specific variables differ for each group of rural inhabitants  this suggests that governments overestimate both the willingness of rural residents to volunteer and the benefits of becoming active in village life  
 liveness redux  on media and their claim to be live increasingly media are asserting themselves as live  in television  this has been an important strategy and recently it has been employed by new media platforms such as facebook  periscope and snapchat  this commentary explains the revival of live media by exploring the meaning and operations of the concept and argues the continued relevance of the concept for the study of social media  traditionally  there have been three main approaches to the live in academic writing  i e  liveness as ontology  as phenomenology and as rhetoric   each has its particular shortcoming  this paper proposes that it is more productive to understand the live as a construction that assists to secure media a central role in everyday life  
 living near to attractive nature  a well being indicator for ranking dutch  danish  and german functional urban areas while nature is widely acknowledged to contribute to people s well being  nature based well being indicators at city level appear to be underprovided  this study aims at filling this gap by introducing a novel indicator based on the proximity of city residents to nature that is of high amenity  high amenity nature is operationalized by combining unique systematic data on people s perceptions of what are the locations of attractive natural areas with data on natural land cover  the proposed indicator departs from the usual assumption of equal well being from any nature  as it approximates the  actual  subjective quality of nature near people s homes in a spatially explicit way  such indicator is used to rank 148  cities  in the netherlands  denmark  and germany  international comparability of the indicator is enhanced by the use of a definition of cities as functional urban areas  fuas   which are consistently identified across countries  results demonstrate that the average  nearness  of fua populations to high amenity nature varies widely across the observed fuas  a key finding  that complements insights from existing city level indicators  is that while populations of fuas with higher population densities may live relatively far from nature in general  they also live  on average  closer to high amenity nature than inhabitants of lower density fuas  our results may stimulate policy debates on how to combine urban agglomeration with access to natural amenities in order to account for people s wellbeing  
 living on the periphery of youth  young people s narratives of youth life in rural areas drawing on theoretical perspectives regarding the importance of place and belonging to a place in understanding young people s lives as well as broader processes of social change and continuity  this article explores conceptions of youth as experiencedand narratedby young people living in rural areas  the article analyzes how discourses on urbanism and youth can be traced in young people s narratives about their communities and their own lives as young people  how these discourses seem to frame the young people s narratives and how they rearticulate these discourses through their accounts  davies  2000   in the article  we thus also focus attention on the cracks and opposing discourses that can be identified in the young people s narratives  and how they influence their relationship with their local area  
 local breeds   rural heritage or new market opportunities  colliding views on the conservation and sustainable use of landraces in this research  finnish actors engaged in the conservation and sustainable use of local breeds on different levels and sectors were interviewed to find out how breeds are valued by different stakeholders and what kinds of policies and practices are preferred in their conservation and sustainable use  and which also gives rise to some ethical concerns  four storylines based on sustainable use vs  conservation and service based vs  production based dimensions were derived from the research data  the research revealed a broad diversity of perceptions of the aims and means of conservation and sustainable use  some stakeholders brought up different possibilities regarding the different means of in situ conservation  yet  many were strictly in favour of conservation and against sustainable use  moreover  in questions of ownership  stakeholders differed in their opinions  the colliding views diversify the conservation and sustainable use of landraces but simultaneously constitute a challenge to finding common aims and means to it  communication between stakeholders should be improved to enable actors  at the implementation level  to make long lasting commitments regarding the conservation and sustainable use of local breeds  furthermore  animals should be regarded as conservation actors  in addition to people and organisations  
 location  libation and leisure  an examination of the use of licensed venues to help challenge sexual violence anti rape campaign messages have increasingly targeted men in order to educate them on the law of  sexual  consent  the 18 24 age demographic are at increased risk of experiencing sex offences  with over half of these crimes involving alcohol consumption  the interactions which culminate in alcohol involved rape often commence in night time venues  making intuitive sense for prevention campaigns to be based within licensed establishments  the night time economy  however  comprises venues where people go to drink  have fun  take time out  and which are characterised and criticised for their promotion of sexism  this article therefore asks  how useful are licensed spaces in promoting rape prevention discourses amongst young men  to this end  the article analyses 41 students  discussions  across six focus groups  regarding a rape prevention campaign that ran in one english city and that directed its prevention advice at males  in doing so  we argue that environments which incite narratives of loss of control and hypersexuality compromise the ability to counter sexual offending  we also argue that the presence of sexually violent advertising within licenced spaces undermines considerably the call to end gendered violence  
 long term consequences of youth volunteering  voluntary versus involuntary service despite the renewed interest in youth volunteering in recent years  there remain major gaps in our knowledge of its consequences  drawing data from the national longitudinal study of adolescent to adult health  we examine the long term effects of youth volunteering on the civic and personal aspects of volunteers  lives  our results suggest that youth volunteering has a positive return on adult volunteering only when it is voluntary  and that net of contextual factors neither voluntary nor involuntary youth service has a significant effect on adult voting  regarding personal outcomes  our findings indicate that the psychological benefits of youth volunteering accrue only to voluntary participants  whereas both voluntary and involuntary youth service are positively associated with educational attainment and earnings in young adulthood  taken together  these results lend support to the case for youth volunteer programs  though the civic benefits of these programs appear to be less dramatic than generally suggested   c  2017 elsevier inc  all rights reserved  
 long term private renters  perceptions of security and insecurity many developed economies  especially in liberal welfare regimes   have experienced a substantial growth in private rental housing  bound up with this dynamic is the rising incidence of long term private renting  private renting for ten years or more   regulation of the private rental sector in liberal welfare regimes is light and post the written agreement residents are subject to constant de jure insecurity  drawing on a questionnaire survey and in depth interviews  the primary focus   this article investigates the impacts of perpetual de jure housing insecurity on long term private renters in diverse housing markets  low   medium  and high rent  in sydney and melbourne  the results indicate that de jure insecurity does not necessarily translate into de facto insecurity  long term private renters typically respond to perpetual de jure insecurity in one of three ways   incessant anxiety and fear  lack of concern  and concern offset by economic social capital and traded off against locational preference  
 longitudinal factor analysis of public expenditure composition and human development in brazil after the 1988 constitution the way public policies are managed in brazil has changed since the 1988 federal constitution  this study aimed to identify how changes in the structure of public expenditure composition at brazilian federal states influenced local human development in these states  the states  public expenditures were categorized according to their nature as spending indices whereas human development was measured through a human development index  hd   to verify the relationships between these variables  an accounting social theoretical model was created and estimated through latent growth modeling  lgm   the lgm measurement period comprised five administration cycles of the brazilian states  1988 2011   variables were measured on data of the second year of state government term  their mean initial values and growth rates were recorded  results show that  influenced by policies of centralized regulation promoted by the federal government  only the social spending growth rates had statistically significant effect on the human development growth rate  although not considered of great magnitude  among mean initial values  the most significant was that of minimum spending  sim   which denotes the direct impact of the fiscal accountability law  lei de responsabilidade fiscal  in portuguese  on human development improvements  the mean initial value of economic spending also showed a positive and significant effect on hd growth rate  
 love thy self  how belief in a supportive god shapes self esteem previous research raises the question of self esteem as a fundamental human need  but also indicates that self esteem is an inherently social product  is religious involvement influential and does it depend on beliefs about god  in this research  we examine the associations between multiple dimensions of religious involvement and self esteem  and specifically focus on the belief in a supportive higher power   divine support   as a central influence in this relationship  analyses of a national probability sample of adults from the us  2004 general social survey  reveal two central findings   1  divine support helps to explain a positive association between religious involvement and self esteem   2  divine support strengthens that association  these findings contribute to the growing discussion about beliefs about god especially as an engaged  involved  and influential force in everyday life and the association with different components of the self concept  our observations underscore the need for more research on the intersection of beliefs and practices in shaping various facets of personal functioning  
 making and breaking party leaders  an informational theory of temporary and lasting impacts of prime minister debates in spain objective  in this project  we develop an informational theory that identifies which prime minister debates are the most meaningful in terms of shifting spanish public opinion  we argue that debates immediately following the installation of new leaders  because they shine light on leadership traits  and debates occurring in times of crisis  because voters can judge both the leader s ability to remedy the problems and their policy proposals  will have the largest short and long term effects  methods  we use seemingly unrelated regression to explore the impacts of 15 spanish state of the nation debates from 1998 to 2016 on vote intention for partido popular  pp  and the partido socialista obrero espanol  psoe   result  debates following the installation of new party leaders often produce sizable improvements in vote intention  but the most meaningful debates occur during economic crises  conclusion  parliamentary debates are valuable opportunities for party leaders to shift public opinion in their favor  a fact that is not lost to them considering the time and energy devoted to crafting strategies  and the media s fascination with providing extensive coverage of the debates  this study has important implications for the study of dynamic processes  such as vote intention   and the link between parties  strategic communications and voting behavior  
 making it count  breadth and intensity of extracurricular engagement and high school dropout previous research suggests that extracurricular engagement reduces the likelihood of high school dropout  particularly among traditionally at risk populations such as racial and ethnic minorities and students from low income families  using social bond theory  we examine how the breadth and intensity of extracurricular engagement are related to the likelihood of dropout among a nationally representative sample of students over three years of schooling  using logistic regression models  we use data from the education longitudinal study of 2002 to examine how extracurricular participation relates to the potential of dropping out by accounting for known correlates and potential selection biases  we find a significant positive relationship between engagement in extracurricular activities  both in number and distribution over different types of activities  and a reduced likelihood of dropout  this relationship is particularly strong in the case of athletic involvement among african american students and for students who simultaneously participate in both athletic and academic fine arts activities  implications of these findings are discussed in light of current policy trends toward the elimination of extracurricular programming and the assessment of student participation fees  
 making strategic choices  how and why indian groups advocated for federal recognition from 1977 to 2012 how and why do groups employ law strategically in different venues  this article combines theoretical and methodological insights from sociolegal and interest group studies to investigate how and why nonfederally recognized indian groups used administrative and legislative strategies for federal recognition from 1977 to 2012  by detailing the circumstances leading indian groups to employ varying strategies  it provides a more nuanced understanding of the dynamic interplay among the goals  motivations  and constraints influencing groups to use administrative and legislative processes over time  
 malawi s energy needs and agroforestry  adoption potential of woodlots rapid urbanization and population growth have resulted in increasing demand for fuelwood and higher rates of deforestation in malawi  agroforestry fuelwood technology  aft  offers a sustainable approach to addressing this problem  adoption levels  however  remain low due to several factors  this study explores the influence and interactions among these factors based on analyses of data collected from a large scale extension effort using binary regression and interaction tests  the results show aft adoption throughout the country is influenced positively by factors such as farming groups and education  further  labor availability and landholdings are important in the relatively less fertile south  while increased levels of individual income were found to mediate positive influences on adoption  environmental governance was found to moderate negative influences  based on our results  we suggest closer monitoring of lead farmers  targeted training  promotion of environmental governance  and increased emphasis on due diligence during extension planning  
 man thou art dust  rites of passage in austere times in response to recent calls for further cross disciplinary research on austerity and a deeper sociological understanding of the impact and aftermath of the economic crisis on individuals and societies  this article builds on extant austerity literature through an exploration of its effects on european men  informed by theories of liminality and rites of passage  this qualitative investigation examines the experience of austerity from the perspective of 11 men through the three liminal stages of separation  transition and reaggregation and investigates its impact on their identity  responsibilities and expectations  our findings reveal the negative experiences of alienation and outsiderhood alongside positive experiences of communitas  solidarity and comradeship  the study provides a nuanced understanding of modern male europeans and their rites of passage  through austere times  
 managing boundaries  the role of non profit organisations in russia s managed democracy this article examines russian human service non profit organisations  npos  to investigate the nature of civil society in a managed democracy  specifically the focus is on emerging vertical ties between npos and ruling and governing elites  drawing on qualitative data collected from health and education npos in three industrial regions  we find that in establishing such vertical ties the role of organisations and individuals within is changing   they have moved away from ignored outsiders towards accessing the circles of power and being tasked with managing the boundary between the state and civil society  in exploring these arrangements this article highlights that in the post soviet space  npos and the state are closely intertwined resembling co optation  as a result the democratisation potential of human service npos is constrained  in discussing these insights we also draw parallels to contexts in which the state has outsourced welfare service to human service npos  
 managing risk and patient involvement in choosing treatment for cancer  an analysis of two communication practices drawing on conversation analyses of oncology consultations collected in italy  the article examines the communication practices used to recommend treatments  we found that the oncologist formulates the treatment recommendation  tr  for high risk patients in terms of a mandatory  choice and for low risk patients as an optional  type of decision  in the first case the doctor presses to reach a decision during the visit while in the second case leaves the decision open ended  results show that high risk patients have less time to decide  are pressured towards choosing an option  but have more opportunities for involvement in tr during the visit  low risk patients instead have more time and autonomy to make a choice  but they are also less involved in the decision making in the visit time  moreover  we document that tr is organised through sequential activities in which the oncologist informs the patient of alternative therapeutic options while at the same time building a case for the kind of treatment she he believes to be best for the patient s health  we suggest that in this field risk plays a key role in decision making which should be better understood with further studies and taken into account in the debate on shared decision making and patient centred communication  
 managing  making sense of and finding meaning in advanced illness  a qualitative exploration of the coping and wellbeing experiences of patients with lung cancer coping plays an essential role in maintaining the wellbeing of patients with cancer  a number of different coping responses and strategies have been identified in the literature  the value and relevance of meaning based coping theory has also been emphasised  including antonovosky s sense of coherence  soc  theory  ten patients with advanced lung cancer were interviewed up to three times  a total of twenty in depth interviews were carried out  fully transcribed and data were analysed following a methodology of interpretative phenomenological analysis  three broad domains were identified to categorise the core life concerns of participants  making sense of and managing one s illness  maintaining daily life and relationships and confronting the future  within these domains multiple coping themes are identified  which to varying degrees help to maintain patient wellbeing and quality of life  this article considers the relevance of soc theory for understanding the coping experiences of patients with advanced cancer  and identifies resources and factors likely to support patient coping  with implications for health and social care services  
 mapping social quality clusters and its implications comparative studies of social quality  sq  are intricately entangled with social indicators for conducting the theoretical analysis of social reality  thus  how to utilize and compare the data of social indicators constitutes a crucial issue for sq comparisons  since social quality studies possess a strong synthetic feature of analysis  the convenient method of indicator studies by listing score ranking by country seems insufficient to meet the research needs  this study will explore a new way of performing sq comparisons through a measure of mapping that compiles a different sq profile and elucidates its clustering effect  through utilizing world value surveys  we present data on sq related issues from this database and analyze them through a new technical design  in this way  we identify three sq clusters and providing some explanations about the rationale of this classification  through which the particular method of sq analysis and their policy implications are demonstrated  
 margins of freedom  a field theoretic approach to class based health dispositions and practices pierre bourdieu s theory of practice situates social practices in the relational interplay between experiential mental phenomena  habitus   resources  capitals  and objective social structures  fields   when applied to class based practices in particular  the overarching field of power within which social classes are potentially made manifest is the primary field of interest  applying relational statistical techniques to original survey data from toronto and vancouver  canada  we investigated whether smoking  engaging in physical activity and consuming fruit and vegetables are dispersed in a three dimensional field of power shaped by economic and cultural capitals and cultural dispositions and practices  we find that aesthetic dispositions and flexibility of developing and established dispositions are associated with positioning in the canadian field of power and embedded in the logics of the health practices dispersed in the field  from this field theoretic perspective  behavioural change requires the disruption of existing relations of harmony between the habitus of agents  the fields within which the practices are enacted and the capitals that inform and enforce the mores and regularities of the fields  the three dimensional model can be explored at  
 marital status and perceived discrimination among transgender people despite calls for increased attention to the experiences of transgender people  scientific understanding of the stigma and discrimination this population experiences is limited  the authors integrate minority stress and marital advantage perspectives to assess marital status differences in transgender related perceived discrimination among transgender people in multiple life domains  the workplace  family  health care  and public accommodations  they analyze one of the first and most comprehensive large scale samples of transgender people in the united states  n 4 286   the national transgender discrimination survey  they find that married transgender respondents tend to report lower levels of perceived discrimination than their cohabiting and previously married transgender counterparts  married transgender respondents do not  however  report lower levels of perceived discrimination than their never married counterparts  once all covariates are accounted for  these marital status differences appear primarily among transwomen but not transmen  economic resources account for some  but not all  of these differences  
 market driven production of biospecimens and the role of nhs hospital led biobanks biobanks are vital for biospecimen production in research  despite the regulatory  recruitment and commercial difficulties they face  we conducted interviews with clinicians  researchers  volunteers who recruit biobank participants  regulators and nhs managers about the integration of a biobank into an nhs hospital  we show that medical waste collected for biomedical research acquires its socio ethical and economic value from the level of integration  both technologically and organisationally  of the biobank into the nhs hospital  there is extensive investment in a range of intellectual and commercial relationships and labour among stakeholders involved in the production of biospecimens  it is not only the boundaries of research  clinical care and commercialisation of biospecimens that blur but also those of volunteerism and citizenship  hospital led biobanks provide an opportunity to study the intertwining of biomedical innovation and healthcare  
 marking time in ethnography  uncovering temporal dispositions in this paper  we reflect on how time is appraised  organized  and managed by a group of researchers conducting an ethnography of 12 low income families  we develop the concept of temporal dispositions  perceptions and preferences around time that in turn shape temporal practices  the concept of temporal dispositions encapsulates individuals  background and training  agency and reflexivity  and the dynamic nature of ongoing social life and interactions through which temporal meanings may change or take on new symbolic weight  overlaid upon each of these are larger social structures and power relations that affirm some temporal dispositions and stigmatize others  we conclude by considering the implications for ethnographic fieldworkers  we argue that analyzing the many ways researchers and participants navigate and perceive time offers insight into unspoken temporal assumptions  ideologies  and inequalities  
 marriage  work  and racial inequalities in poverty  evidence from the united states this article explores recent racial and ethnic inequalities in poverty  estimating the share of racial poverty differentials that can be explained by variation in family structure and workforce participation  the authors use logistic regression to estimate the association between poverty and race  family structure  and workforce participation  they then decompose between race differences in poverty risk to quantify how racial disparities in marriage and work explain observed inequalities in the log odds of poverty  they estimate that 47 7  to 48 9  of black white differences in poverty risk can be explained by between group variance in these two factors  while only 4 3  to 4 5  of the hispanic white differential in poverty risk can be explained by these variables  the findings underscore the continued but varied association between racial disparities in poverty and labor and marriage markets  clear racial differences in the origin of poverty suggest that policy interventions will not have uniformly effective impacts on poverty reduction  
 marxism  mediation  historiography  writing about 1857 what are the methods and goals of radical history  how can marxist historiography  charged with producing radical histories  contend with the postmodernist challenge that knowledge is always mediated  that only fragments are recoverable  not totalities  working through concepts and methods associated with postcolonial literary studies and subaltern studies  the article analyzes a document in the british colonial archives from the time of the 1857 revolt in india that challenges both nationalist and imperialist histories of its most famous rebel  lakshmibai  queen of jhansi  understanding mediation and the limits of knowledge   the fissures and conflicts among colonial officials  the ambiguity of the queen s intentions   are crucial to understanding this file  and the 1857 revolt itself  but marxist historiography must also link that text   mediated and complex as it is   to the world outside of the archive  and seek explanatory frameworks and adequate truths in the effort to produce radical histories  
 maternal risk anxiety in belfast  claims  evaluations  responses this article considers the social logic of maternal anxiety about risks posed to children in segregated  post conflict neighbourhoods  focusing on qualitative research with mothers in belfast s impoverished and divided inner city  the article draws on the interactionist perspective in the sociology of emotions to explore the ways in which maternal anxiety drives claims for recognition of good mothering  through orientations to these neighbourhoods  drawing on hirschman s model of exit  loyalty and voice types of situated action  the article examines the relationship between maternal risk anxiety and evaluations of neighbourhood safety  in arguing that emotions are important aspects of claims for social recognition  the article demonstrates that anxiety provokes efforts to claim status  in this context through the explicit affirmation of non sectarian mothering  
 measuring five dimensions of religiosity across adolescence this paper theorizes and tests a latent variable model of adolescent religiosity in which five dimensions of religiosity are interrelated  religious beliefs  religious exclusivity  external practice  private practice  and religious salience  research often theorizes overlapping and independent influences of single items or dimensions of religiosity on outcomes such as adolescent sexual behavior  but rarely operationalizes the dimensions in a measurement model accounting for their associations with each other and across time  we use longitudinal structural equation modeling with latent variables to analyze data from two waves of the national study of youth and religion  we test our hypothesized measurement model as compared to four alternate measurement models and find that our proposed model maintains superior fit  we then discuss the associations between the five dimensions of religiosity we measure and how these change over time  our findings suggest how future research might better operationalize multiple dimensions of religiosity in studies of the influence of religion in adolescence  
 measuring german fathers  involvement in childcare in fatherhood research  there is an ongoing question of how to measure fathers  engagement in childcare  recent studies mainly use  1  the amount of time spent on childcare and or  2  the use of paid parental leave as core indicators of paternal involvement  to examine how these two indicators of fathers  engagement have to be understood differently  this study juxtaposes the determinants of these indicators  also differentiating between absolute and relative  i e   compared to their partner  measures  four negative binomial regression models are conducted with german socio economic panel data on 712 fathers with a child born between 2007 and 2013  the results indicate that there are distinct relationships behind the four different measures of fathers  engagement  fathers  absolute and relative time for childcare is mostly explained by other time use measures and a couples  employment participation  with regard to fathers  parental leave use  the absolute rather than the relative measures might be more suitable to explain fathers  constraints to take up parental leave that are aligned to their work situation  
 measuring multiple discrimination through a survey based methodology this paper focuses on the concept of multiple discrimination and its measurement through survey methods  the study was designed as a quasi experimental comparison of survey mode effects on the quality of discrimination measurement  the traditional  face to face  survey  the conventional self completed mode and cawi  finally deleted due to its non comparability   consistent with our hypothesis  some support was obtained for the social desirability bias and survey mode effects  1  self administration of questionnaires favours the declaration of discriminatory attitudes and personal experiences of discrimination  2  the effect of privacy is greater in direct indicators of discriminatory attitudes  3  perceptions and experiences of discrimination are more frequently reported by highly educated respondents  nevertheless  contrary to our expectations  less educated respondents are also affected by survey mode and continue to be underrepresented in self completed methods  the current research aims to serve as a basis for further research in this area   c  2017 elsevier inc  all rights reserved  
 media and the politics of the sacral  freedom of expression in tunisia after the arab uprisings in 2011  calls for dignity  led the mantra for change in the arab uprisings  degage    clear out    was hurled against tunisia s president ben ali and his fellow arab dictators  coercive paradigms that robbed citizens of agency and censored their convictions  during the exceptional politics that ensued  tunisia s liberated media exemplified the independence the revolution had achieved  yet  how free expression was constituted grew increasingly contentious as the media s lens projected ambiguities in practices surrounding religious and political norms   what harald wydra terms sacral symbolisms    within the popular imaginary  this implicated interpretations of what was publicly acceptable and dignified and what was not  the media s engagement with freedom of expression and its significations went through three stages  first  degage   or freedom from   was celebrated as an erasure of humiliation  the disharmony of competing symbolisms took on new import  however  as the second aspect of constructing dignity  freedom to   became a contested political and cultural space  mediation of free expression became a site of power politics and appropriation  creating red lines  that curtailed certain liberties to secure others  thereby recasting the contention as freedom for whom   this third stage  in train  remains a realm of mediated uncertainty  
 media imperialism beyond the anglo saxon axis  or negotiated hybridity  neo orientalist telenovelas and transnational business in brazilian television since the beginning of the millennium  several brazilian telenovelas have been partially produced abroad  incorporating in their storylines protagonists from different ethnic and religious backgrounds  exotic customs  foreign jargon  and attractive tourist locations in middle eastern and south east asian countries  this article aims to contribute to the debate regarding the asymmetries in media contents flow from central to developing countries  through analyzing the production of brazilian transnational telenovelas broadcasted during 2001 2012  rejecting the media imperialism thesis as formulated in the 1960s and 1970s  as well as the more optimistic approaches pointing to the erosion of persistent asymmetries in the production and reception of television contents  this study examines the economic  cultural  and political forces driving the production and consumption of television contents outside the anglo saxon axis  pointing to the cooperation  conflicts  and negotiations between television producers  national audiences  international publics  and private actors  
 memes as reasonably hostile laments  a discourse analysis of political dissent in oman in this article  i investigate how political dissent is linguistically constructed and mitigated in memes that are circulated nationally on whatsapp in oman  i do so by drawing upon insights from relational approaches to face  the theorization of communicative strategies as polysemous and ambiguous  and research pertaining to the islamic practice of lamenting  the data consist of a representative set of memes collected in the summer and fall of 2015 as part of an ethnographic project on social media and arab identity  i theorize memes as cultural tools that take the form of reasonably hostile  lament narratives  which enable citizens in oman to engage in democracy while saving face  to create lament memes that voice dissent while mitigating face attacks  omanis draw upon various communicative strategies  they use repetition  code choice  hashtags  and different genres  they juxtapose emojis with text  and they manipulate the production and participation frameworks of texts  collectively  these strategies  which function via intertextuality  allow the concerns to be aired  but indirectly and playfully  the article demonstrates how political dissent is negotiated and mitigated through memes  the agency of social media users  and the validity of conceptualizing memes as cultural tools  
 metabolic rift or metabolic shift  dialectics  nature  and the world historical method in the flowering of red green thought over the past two decades  metabolic rift thinking is surely one of its most colorful varieties  the metabolic rift has captured the imagination of critical environmental scholars  becoming a shorthand for capitalism s troubled relations in the web of life  this article pursues an entwined critique and reconstruction  of metabolic rift thinking and the possibilities for a post cartesian perspective on historical change  the world ecology conversation  far from dismissing metabolic rift thinking  my intention is to affirm its dialectical core  at stake is not merely the mode of explanation within environmental sociology  the impasse of metabolic rift thinking is suggestive of wider problems across the environmental social sciences  now confronted by a double challenge  one of course is the widespread and reasonable sense of urgency to evolve modes of thought appropriate to an era of deepening biospheric instability  the second is the widely recognized but inadequately internalized understanding that humans are part of nature  
 micro aggressions  single mothers and interactions with government workers  the case of australia s child support bureaucracy this article analyses single mothers  experiences of australia s child support bureaucracy  shifting the focus beyond problematic individual interactions to the discourses that shape them  drawing on data from semi structured interviews with 37 australian single mothers  i argue that women s interactions with department of human services   child support  dhs cs  are expressions of gender focused micro aggressions  these are interactions that express and reinforce social hierarchies and power differentials in sometimes subtle and often taken for granted ways  i argue these interactions are structured by the dominant gendered welfare discourse that constitutes the welfare mother and legitimates masculine financial discretion  thus  any attempt to address client concerns about the failings of dhs cs  and by extension other government bureaucracies  must extend beyond training  and administrative processes  and engage with the more challenging strategies of socio cultural change  
 microbial suicide  towards a less anthropocentric ontology of life and death while unicellular microbes such as phytoplankton  marine algae  have long been considered immortal unless eaten by predators  recent research suggests that under specific conditions entire populations of phytoplankton actively kill themselves  their assumed atemporality is being revised as marine ecologists recognize phytoplankton s important role in the global carbon cycle  drawing on empirical research into programmed cell death in marine microbes  this article explores how  in their study of microbial death  scientists change not only our understanding of microbial temporality  but also reconstruct the relationship between life and death  biological individuality and assumptions about a natural teleology associated with bounded biological systems and genetic programmes  reading this research together with a derridean deconstruction of the limit between human and other animals with respect to death  this article explores how the deconstruction of individuality from within biology may suggest alternatives to our anthropocentric notion of time and embodiment  
 migrant family visits and the life course  interrelationships between age  capacity and desire migrant visits to the country of origin play a crucial role in transnational family cohesion and migrant well being  the research on them so far has focused primarily on the relationship between migrant integration and transnational engagement  in this article  i extend the discussion by adding a life course perspective to carling and hoelscher s  2013  framework for studying transnational activities  which incorporates capacity and desire  i explore whether age has an independent effect on migrants  family visits and how it relates to socio economic resources  migration status and transnational ties  using data from a survey of peruvian migrants around the globe  n 7 741   i show that migrants  stage in the life course has a partial effect on their propensity to travel through the interrelationship between age  capacity and desire  the findings show that the capacity and desire of migrants to visit their country of origin are particularly strong after reaching retirement age  suggesting a favourable combination of resources at later stages in life  however  whether this expresses a positive approach to ageing  or is a strategy to balance transnational family obligations and to postpone return decisions  remains open for future research  
 milieus and mixed methods describing and explaining religion and secularity in switzerland in the literature on religion and secularity  scholars often use mono method strategies  either quantitative or qualitative  in order to identify broad social groups    milieus  or  social aggregates  and thus gain better understanding of the great diversity of religious beliefs and practices in a given population  this paper identifies different validity problems of such studies and claims that mixed methods may be used in order to better address these problems  by combining representative surveys with semi standardized interviews  large scale groups  e  g  milieus  can be described and some of their inner workings explained in a more valid way  the article shows the steps of such a mixed methods research strategy  arguing for  a  a common central question in a realist philosophical framework  b  nested qualitative and quantitative samples with relatively large n on the qualitative side   c  an integrated data collection on the level of items and leading questions   d  abductive iterative data analysis  and  e  an addressing of validity issues with the help of mixed methods  two nested mixed methods studies are used to exemplify these research strategies  one on religion and spirituality in switzerland and one on the  evangelical milieu  in switzerland  
 millets  milk and maggi  contested processes of the nutrition transition in rural india the nutrition transition a process of dietary change that describes the shift to calorie dense  higher fat and protein diets from cereal based ones is happening in india  this paper argues that relatively little is known about the nature of nutrition transition in india  this is a result of both a lack of adequate and timely data and a consequence of national and state level statistics  which render an incomplete and potentially misleading picture of how these processes are unfolding in local contexts  this may be especially true in india where very little ethnographic research has documented the dual edges of nutrition transitions  analyzing data collected from the kumaon hills  uttarakhand in 2013  this paper suggests the ways in which aspects of the nutrition transition have developed unevenly over space and time  in particular  while new types of calorie dense foods have infiltrated these rural  remote areas  the process has been uneven and fraught with contestation due to preexisting social practices  more troubling is the evidence that though incomes are rising  the predicted increases in high value  protein rich foods may actually be declining  this paper concludes by arguing that the widely influential nutrition transition literature needs look to ethnographic and in depth qualitative methods to form better policies relevant to the contingencies of dietary and epidemiological change  
 mind the gap  financial london and the regional class pay gap the hidden barriers  or gender pay gap   preventing women from earning equivalent incomes to men is well documented  yet recent research has uncovered that  in britain  there is also a comparable class origin pay gap in higher professional and managerial occupations  so far this analysis has only been conducted at the national level and it is not known whether there are regional differences within the uk  this paper uses pooled data from the 2014 and 2015 labour force survey  n 7 534  to stage a more spatially sensitive analysis that examines regional variation in the class pay gap  we find that this class ceiling  is not evenly spatially distributed  instead it is particularly marked in central london  where those in high status occupations who are from working class backgrounds earn  on average  10 660 pound less per year than those whose parents were in higher professional and managerial employment  finally  we inspect the capital further to reveal that the class pay gap is largest within central london s banking and finance sector  challenging policy conceptions of london as the engine room  of social mobility  these findings suggest that class disadvantage within high status occupations is particularly acute in the capital  the findings also underline the value of investigating regional differences in social mobility  and demonstrate how such analysis can unravel important and previously unrecognized spatial dimensions of class inequality  
 mixed methods   state of the art and current issues while mixed methods research is already much advanced and institutionalized in textbooks  handbooks and its own journal on an international level  the german language debate on mixed methods lags behind  thus  this introductory paper starts with outlining the history and key concepts of mixed methods designs as well as the current state of the international debate  next  we explain the aims and concept of this special issue as well as the crucial arguments of the single papers in the overall context of the special issues  namely  the debate in this special issue of the kolner zeitschrift fur soziologie und sozialpsychologie circles around the following four topics  philosophical  methodological and methodical foundations of mixed methods research  mixed methods designs and mixed methods sampling  modes of combining data and issues of validity  and process oriented analysis  longitudinal analysis and evaluation  based on the observations that  firstly  both the international social science research community and social problems are globalizing and  secondly  that social research itself is changing  especially by the increasing relevance of social media and big data  the paper concludes with suggestions for future research  
 mixed methods sampling as a means of constituting a diffuse and heterogeneous field an example from the classification of fears of the future in dystopian feature films problems in defining the research field and in generalizing emerge in both quantitative and qualitative research  with the analysis of  fears of the future in dystopian feature films   a multi stage sampling strategy is presented to point out these difficulties as well as to illustrate one possible way of dealing with them  particularly  in heterogeneous  rapidly changing and diffuse fields of research conducting mixed method studies can compensate for the weaknesses of quantitative and qualitative research logics  therefore  further research should address issues of field delineation  sampling and generalization in greater detail  
 model ambiguities in configurational comparative research for many years  sociologists  political scientists  and management scholars have readily relied on qualitative comparative analysis  qca  for the purpose of configurational causal modeling  however  this article reveals that a severe problem in the application of qca has gone unnoticed so far  model ambiguities  these arise when multiple causal models fare equally well in accounting for configurational data  mainly due to the uncritical import of an algorithm that is unsuitable for causal modeling  researchers have typically been unaware of the whole model space  as a result  there exists an indeterminable risk for practically all qca studies published in the last quarter century to have presented findings that their data did not warrant  using hypothetical data  we first identify the algorithmic source of ambiguities and discuss to what extent they affect different methodological aspects of qca  by reanalyzing a published qca study from rural sociology  we then show that model ambiguities are not a mere theoretical possibility but a reality in applied research  which can assume such extreme proportions that no causal conclusions whatsoever are possible  finally  the prevalence of model ambiguities is examined by performing a comprehensive analysis of 192 truth tables across 28 qca studies published in applied sociology  in conclusion  we urge that future qca practice ensures full transparency with respect to model ambiguities  both by informing readers of qca based research about their extent and by employing algorithms capable of revealing them  
 molecularisation and metaphor this article explores the molecularisation of medicine thesis by investigating reports on genetics and molecular medicine in the new england journal of medicine  while there has indeed been a large increase in the number of references to molecules in the context of genetics over the last few decades these are mostly embedded in a framework of explanatory metaphors  namely  gene  expressivity  penetrance  regulation and pathways  as most of these metaphors are drawn from the social world it would appear that the molecularisation thesis   that social life is becoming dominated by the molecular   needs to be tempered by the ways in which understanding of that molecular world is itself a reflection of social life  
 more structural holes  more risk  network structure and risk perception among marijuana growers this study examines the relationship between network structure and risk perceptions  we use self report data on 359 illicit marijuana growers and their personal co worker networks  our results show that growers with more structural holes in their co worker network perceive higher risk of apprehension from law enforcement  we argue that this result is facilitated by two mechanisms  1  the amount and quality of information available to growers about risks and detection  which uses guidance from stafford and warr s  1993  concept of vicarious deterrence  and  2  the trust inherent in their network and the growers  self awareness of their own network position  which relies on coleman s  1988  and burt s  2005  ideas of network closure as a protective factor   c  2017 elsevier b v  all rights reserved  
 motherhood  employment  and the dynamics of women s gender attitudes this article presents an investigation of the dynamics of women s gender attitudes from the perspective of women s conflicting employment and child rearing responsibilities  it examines the independent and joint effects of motherhood and employment on gender attitudes using combined data from the british household panel survey and the understanding society panel study  the results of fixed effects models show no evidence supporting a direct influence of either motherhood or employment on women s attitudes toward a traditional division of labor  however  changes in attitudes are observed when motherhood and employment statuses are considered jointly  specifically  women are less traditional after the transition to motherhood than before only if motherhood is combined with full time employment  by contrast  women are more traditional after the transition to motherhood than before only if motherhood coincides with their withdrawal from the labor force  these associations remain robust after considering feedback from earlier attitudes  all the findings suggest that the emergence and realization of incompatibility between women s employment and child rearing responsibilities reshape women s gender attitudes during the transition to motherhood  
 multi dimensional deprivation in the us this paper presents a comprehensive analysis of multidimensional deprivation in the u s  since the great recession  from 2008 to 2013  we estimate a multidimensional deprivation index by compiling individual level data on several well being dimensions from the american community survey  our results indicate that the proportion of the population that is multidimensional deprived averages about 15 percent  which exceeds the prevalence of official income poverty  lack of education  severe housing burden and lack of health insurance were some of the dimensions in which americans were most deprived in  though deprivation increased during the recession  it trended towards a decline between 2010 and 2013  unlike the official and the supplemental poverty measure which did not show any decline  the deprivation index better reflects the economic recovery since the recession  overall  the prevalence of deprivation was higher in the southern and the western states and among the asian and the hispanic population  importantly  there was not much overlap between individuals who were income poor and those who were multidimensional deprived  in fact  almost 30   of individuals with incomes slightly above the poverty threshold experienced multiple deprivations  our analysis underscores the need to look beyond income based poverty statistics in order to fully realize the impact of the recession on individuals  well being  
 multiracial identities  single race history  contemporary consequences of historical race and marriage laws for racial classification this work interrogates the role of the law as an  actor  in the spatial patterning of racial classification  laws governing racial intermarriage represent key ways that rigid distinctions between groups were codified  critically  there is a great deal of state variation in these laws  we draw on a unique data set that combines samples from the 1990 and 2000 census  5 percent ipums  and the 2009 2011 estimates from the american community survey with information on state specific legal bans against intermarriage  results from multilevel logistic and multinomial analyses indicate that a past of legal regulation is associated with a lower likelihood of a  mixed  classification for the offspring of black white interracial unions  particularly in the 2009 11 period  our results provide evidence that place specific institutional legacies are imprinted on the classification choices made even in the midst of expanding options   c  2017 elsevier inc  all rights reserved  
 muslim women s evolving leadership roles  a case study of women leaders in an immigrant muslim community in post 9 11 america based on three years of ethnographic fieldwork in a multi ethnic immigrant muslim congregation in a midwestern city in the united states  this article scrutinizes the intricate process through which women use traditional gender roles and expectations to legitimate and operationalize women s leadership  this study found that de facto congregationalism has made it possible for muslim women to translate their traditional  responsibilities for food preparation and socializing children into greater visibility and voice in both the mosque and broader society  this study provides an in depth examination of the nuanced processes of women s empowerment in american muslim congregations  
 my neighbour  the criminal  how memories of the 1991 1995 conflict in croatia affect attitudes towards the serb minority this paper investigates how croats view the minority serb population in croatia  it is based on focus groups  dyads and interviews conducted in croatia in 2014 and 2015  serbs constitute the other  to croatian identity  which is defined primarily through language and religion  the analysis finds that the predominant war narrative related to the 1991 1995 conflict  one of defence against a larger serbian aggressor  influences both of these notions of identity  as well as perceptions of the serb minority in the state  participants displayed contradictory attitudes in a discourse that featured many key facets of the war narrative  most respondents agreed that serbs should be equal members of croatian society  but they also did not believe cyrillic signs should be put up in vukovar  the introduction of bilingual signs both reduced trust in government institutions and was interpreted as a continued threat against the croatian people and state  
 narratives of the nation in the olympic opening ceremonies  comparative analysis of beijing 2008 and london 2012 this paper examines the ways in which nationalism and the narratives of the nation were constructed in the olympic opening ceremonies in beijing 2008 and london 2012  the ritual of the opening ceremony represents a concentration of features  qualities and messages that combine the local and global  the culturally specific and universal  in a complex production  using textual analysis of the telecast of the above two opening ceremonies  the study found that the beijing 2008 opening ceremony used a grand narrative of progress  emphasising the unified identity of chineseness  while privileging the official narrative of the nation and one collective identity  in contrast  the london 2012 opening ceremony highlighted the fragmented but diversified identity of britishness  transpiring social inclusivity  cultural hybridity and multiculturalism  this may be related to the rise of different type of nationalism in the context of increasing globalisation  the beijing opening ceremony represented the sinocentric chinese new nationalism  whereas the london 2012 counterpart  up to a point  highlighted civic based multicultural nationalism  
 national service and the all volunteer force  a response to hauser s  why america should restore the draft  in  midlife crisis  the all volunteer force at forty   we illustrated the regional and partisan imbalance in today s all volunteer force  avf   and we argued that restoring the draft is neither an effective nor a practicable policy solution to this problem  in response  colonel hauser has argued for restoring the draft  substantially increasing the number of u s  ground forces and reinvigorating congressional foreign policy making  in this article  we question the practicability of colonel hauser s proposals  and we argue that a restored draft would not improve national character  facilitate sounder foreign policy decisions  or reduce costs relative to an avf  
 national trauma and the fear of foreigners  how past geopolitical threat heightens anti immigration sentiment today this paper introduces a historical  macro political argument into the literature on anti immigration sentiment  which has mainly considered individual level predictors such as education or social capital as well as country level factors such as fluctuations in labor market conditions  changing composition of immigration streams  or the rise of populist parties  we argue that past geopolitical competition and war have shaped how national identities formed and thus also contemporary attitudes toward newcomers  countries that have experienced more violent conflict or lost territory and sovereignty developed ethnic  rather than civic  forms of nationalism and thus show higher levels of anti immigration sentiment today  we introduce a geopolitical threat scale and score 33 european countries based on their historical experiences  two anti immigration measures come from the european social survey  mixed effects  ordinal logistic regression models reveal strong statistical and substantive significance for the geopolitical threat scale  furthermore  ethnic forms of national identification do seem to mediate this relationship between geopolitical threat and restrictionist attitudes  the main analysis is robust to a wide variety of model specifications  to the inclusion of all control variables known to affect anti immigration attitudes  and to a series of alternative codings of the geopolitical threat scale  
 nationalism in the united states and canadian primetime broadcast coverage of the 2014 winter olympics the cbc s and nbc s primetime broadcasts of the 2014 winter olympics were analyzed to determine differences between the media treatment of home nation and foreign athletes  the cbc results showed that canadian athletes represented 48 5  of total athlete mentions and constituted all of the top 20 most mentioned athletes  nbc results showed that american athletes represented 43 9  of their total mentions and 65  of the top 20 most mentioned athletes  the cbc was more likely to attribute canadian athletic successes to commitment and intelligence  and non canadian successes to strength  the cbc was more likely to discuss the emotions and background of non canadians and make neutral other comments about canadians  nbc was more likely to attribute american failures to experience  comparisons between the networks revealed 30 significant differences in the manner of depicting home athletes compared to athletes from other nations  
 nature gender relations within a social ecological perspective on european multifunctional agriculture  the case of agrobiodiversity we view agrobiodiversity as a social ecological phenomenon and  therefore  an example of nature gender relations within agrarian change  including social  economic  political and technical changes in agriculture and rural areas  as a result of the industrialization of agriculture  nature gender relations in the field of agrobiodiversity have become characterized by separation processes such as conservation versus use or subsistence versus commodity production  we argue that the sustainable development paradigm  as currently implemented in european common agricultural policy through the concept of multifunctionality  does not necessarily overcome separation tendencies and lead towards integration  despite its claim to bring together different ecological  economic and social needs  in our paper we critically reflect this observation and develop a theory based analytical framework at the interface of nature and gender relations  for analytical purposes we distinguish between three different agrarian structures  pre industrialized  industrialized and multifunctional  and focus on the development of two separation tendencies within them and their effects on agrobiodiversity  concerning nature  we discuss the effects of separating agrobiodiversity conservation and use  with regard to gender  we discuss the separation of subsistence and commodity production  against this background  we claim for new rural economic rationalities characterized by processes whose qualitative  material and value dimensions maintain agrobiodiversity  
 navigating the new  transplanted self  how recipients manage the cognitive risks of organ transplantation the physiological risks of organ transplantation are well documented  but more poorly understood are the sociological ways in which organ recipients redefine themselves in reaction to physiological risks and social changes accompanying transplantation  this article analyses transplantation as a procedure that is not only physiologically risky but also poses risk to the social identity of the recipient  and explores how transplant recipients cognitively navigate transplantation surgery from waiting for to recovering after a transplant  it builds on previous sociological exploration of risk as a socially constructed process mediating experiences of health and illness with a focused contribution on explaining how individuals navigate risks posed to their social identities by major biophysical transformations  this article pointedly analyses narratives of fourteen organ recipients and the four dominant phases of identity management that emerged to create what we have coined as the new transplanted self   indicating the varied ways the individual social self emerges in response to the social risks of transplantation  we conclude that a better understanding of the recipient experience will contribute to improved care in the transplantation field  
 navigating the tensions and agreements in alternative food and sustainability  a convention theoretical perspective on alternative food retail concerns about the unsustainability of the conventional food system have promoted interest in alternative food networks  afns   which are typically conceptualized through their differences from conventional food networks  real life afns  however  tend to show some similarities to the conventional food system  this hybridity has caused some criticism  but also  increasingly  calls for a more open examination of afns  indeed  afns can be seen as relational to and shaped by the prevailing food system  for example the expectations the conventional system has promoted among consumers  in this paper  through a multiple case study of nine alternative food retailers  we examine the negotiation of acceptable practice in afns and the challenges encountered in trying to do things alternatively  we employ convention theory  which encourages a view of action as socially negotiated and situational  and acknowledges plural legitimate notions of worth in guiding and justifying actions  our findings show a plurality of ideals in the domain of afns and a complex navigation between the retailers  own expressed ideals and considerations and perceived consumer expectations  the retailers  justification of actions highlights several areas of tension in afn practice  helping also to understand the challenges in adopting sustainable practices  while responding to consumer expectations sometimes involved adopting more conventional practices  the retailers also challenged consumers on certain issues  our findings also show how even market oriented afns may take radically alternative courses of action  the study supports the broader argument for examining all food networks in an open way  focusing on actual sustainability outcomes  
 negative case selection  justifications and consequences for set theoretic mmr the combined usage of qualitative comparative analysis  qca  and process tracing  pt  in set theoretic multi method research  mmr  holds great potential for reaching valid inferences  established views of case selection after qca hold that studying negative cases provides lessons about the causes of an outcome in a limited set of circumstances  in particular  recommendations focus on negative cases only if they contradict the analysis or if suitably similar positive match cases exist to leverage comparisons  by contrast  i argue that set theoretic mmr can gain from studying negative cases even when these conditions do not hold  first  negative cases can give insights into why an outcome fails to occur  second  they can help guard against theoretical inconsistency between explanations for the outcome and its absence  third  they can ensure that the mechanisms producing the outcome and its absence are not too similar to be logically capable of resulting in different outcomes  following these arguments  i recommend that studies of negative cases in set theoretic mmr focus on failure mechanisms in carefully bounded populations  search for theoretical inconsistency among mechanisms  and focus in part on the mechanism proposed to produce the outcome  
 negligible connections  the role of familiar others in the diffusion of smoking among adolescents how is the delinquent behavior of adolescents influenced by their peers  previous studies in criminology have primarily focused on the effects of friendship networks on delinquency  but what is less examined is the influence of weaker and often negligible relationships on behavior  in this paper  we explore the effect of familiar others  namely those socio demographically similar peers who are not connected through friendships  on the behavioral diffusion of smoking among adolescents  using data from the national longitudinal study of adolescent to adult health  we show that  even after controlling for the behavior of friends  the smoking behavior of familiar others has a significant longitudinal effect on adolescents  likelihood of smoking tobacco and marijuana  the results have important implications for expanding our understanding of the social diffusion of adolescent behavior through contextual mechanisms  
 negotiating norms  girls  pornography and sexual scripts in finnish question and answer forum drawing on 91 pornography related submissions sent by young finns to a moderated question and answer forum on sexual health  this article explores the personal narratives of adolescents on pornography use  special attention is given to the submissions by girls to explore the widely circulated narratives on the sexualization of adolescence more precisely  in focusing on these accounts of sexual exploration  learning and the pursuit of pleasure  the article examines how girls  interests in sexually explicit media can be reflexively understood in the context of everyday sexual practices that are already socially constructed and negotiated  the material reveals that finnish girls depict themselves as invested with substantial agency  competence and volition despite the occasional gender specific anxieties that their encounters with pornography have created  
 neighborhood co offending networks  structural embeddedness  and violent crime in chicago neighborhood disparities in crime are a persistent feature of u s  cities  scholars have documented that both local structural conditions and characteristics of spatially proximate communities influence neigh borhood crime rates  previous studies on neighborhood inequality in crime  however  are limited by their focus on identifying average spillover effects between pairs of spatially contiguous neighborhoods  and have neglected to consider how the broader social organization of the city influences local outcomes  this study examines the role of neighborhood level criminal networks in shaping the distribution of crime throughout cities  employing arrest records and survey data from the project on human development in chicago neighborhoods  we construct a neighborhood level co offending network for chicago for 2001  we use this network to investigate how a focal neighborhood s homicide rate is influenced by its structural embeddedness within the larger inter  neighborhood co offending network  results indicate that a neighborhood s embeddedness increases the local homicide rate  even after controlling for the neighborhood s internal propensity toward crime and accounting for unobserved spatial processes   c  2017 elsevier b v  all rights reserved

 neoliberal penality and state legitimacy  politics of amnesty in turkey during the akp period general amnesty is an extraordinary policy mostly used in the aftermath of civil wars or regime transition to maintain political stability  in turkey  however  amnesties have historically been used to resolve the chronic problems of the criminal justice system  this radically changed after the justice and development party  akp  came to power in 2002  which has taken a sharp anti amnesty position  this shift should be understood as part of akp s neoliberal orientation in criminal justice policies that has increased the dose of punitiveness  emphasized individual responsibility of offenders  and enhanced the organizational efficiency of institutions  central to this neoliberal penal orientation is the party s neopopulist ideology constructed on an image of a strong state that  i  is capable of dealing with structural problems without having to recourse to extraordinary measures   ii  no longer sees criminals as victims of fate   iii  prioritizes victims  rights  our analysis contributes to the mounting literature on neoliberal penalty in two ways  first is by bringing the question of why states forgive at center stage when most work focuses exclusively on how and why states punish  second is by paying closer attention to how developing country governments with limited financial  logistical  and administrative resources manage the tensions and contradictions that neoliberal penal policies bring forth  our arguments are based on official reports  in depth interviews with legal professionals  and descriptive statistics on the criminal justice system  
 network closure and integration in the mid 20th century american mafia criminal networks are thought to be biased toward decentralization and security rather than integration and efficiency  this article examines this tradeoff in a large scale national criminal network spanning more than 700 members of 24 distinct american mafia families operating in the mid 20th century  producing a novel network image of the american mafia as a set of highly differentiated yet intertwined islands of criminal activity  the analysis uncovers a small world structure that allowed both for strong intragroup closure and high intergroup connectivity  this balance reflected a division of network labor in which integrative bridging connections were disproportionately concentrated among a small number of criminals  furthermore  the criminals who held such bridging ties tended to be either low  or high status but not of middling status within their respective organizations   c  2016 elsevier b v  all rights reserved  
 networking in the shadow of the law  informal access to legal expertise through personal network ties civil legal problems are common in everyday life  but the costs of obtaining legal representation create barriers to legal action and contribute to disparities in access to justice  some individuals  however  may have informal access to legal assistance through personal network ties with lawyers  enhancing their responses to justiciable problems  in this study  we draw from theories of social capital and network formation to examine the distribution and mobilization of network based legal expertise  using nationally representative survey data  we find that network based access to lawyers is widespread  and most people who have ties to lawyers expect to informally mobilize legal assistance when facing a problem  but people who are most likely to afford formal legal representation are also most likely to have informal access to lawyers  thus  while informal access to lawyers may shape responses to legal problems  it may also exacerbate inequalities in experiences with civil justice events  
 networks of non participation  comparing  supportive    unsupportive  and  undecided  non participants in the uk student protests against fees and cuts as a topic in its own right  political non participation is under studied in the social sciences  while existing approaches have tended to focus on the gaps between engagement patterns and public policy  or the rational disincentives to an individual s participation  less attention has been paid to the explanatory power of socio cultural factors  taking its lead from studies by oegema and klandermans and norgaard  this article uses recent student protests in the uk as a case study for exploring non participation  drawing on survey and interview data  findings indicate that whereas network access and collective identification are commonly seen as helping produce and sustain political participation  networks of collective dis identification might help to produce and sustain political non participation  
 new faces in rural places  patterns and sources of nonmetropolitan ethnoracial diversity since 1990 much of the research on ethnoracial diversity in nonmetropolitan america consists of case studies describing how the arrival of hispanics has transformed a particular community  to complement this work  we examine the dimensions and sources of diversity for a sample of 10 000 nonmetro places  we identify two dimensions of diversitymagnitude and structureand draw hypotheses about their changes and correlates from the spatial assimilation and locational persistence perspectives and relevant scholarship  our analysis of 1990 2010 decennial census and american community survey data documents a pervasive upward trend in diversity magnitude  however  places tend to follow parallel rather than identical diversity trajectories and to retain the same type of racial ethnic structure in 2010 that they exhibited 20 years earlier  fixed effects regression models show that ethnoracial diversity gains are most likely in nonmetro communities with plentiful economic opportunities  fewer old residents  and growing total  foreign born  and correctional populations  these correlates hold for micropolitan and rural places and across census regions  though our results largely conform to locational persistence logic  we find that spatial assimilation still has some merit  underscoring the importance of incorporating multiple theoretical models into a segmented change approach to nonmetropolitan diversity  
 new interest in wild forest products in europe as an expression of biocultural dynamics in europe  interest in wild forest products is increasing  such products may be interpreted in a biological sense as deriving from autonomously growing forest species or in a biocultural sense as reflecting dynamics in human living with biodiversity through re wilding of earlier domesticated species  in this article i elaborate the idea that the new interests reflect biocultural dynamics  first  i identify these dynamics as involving both domestication and re wilding and characterize these processes as involving biological  environmental  and cultural dimensions  next  i present a comparative review of two approaches to re wilding forest production in the netherlands  meat production from new types of natural grazing systems  and food production from plants re introduced to the wild  the first approach is based on the stimulation of naturally occurring ecological processes and the second on the stimulation of new forms of experiencing bio cultural heritage  the examples demonstrate that the new interests in wild forest products involve both a return to earlier stages of domestication in an ecological sense and a new phase of acculturation to evolving socio cultural conditions  
 new technological interventions in conservation conflicts  countering emotions and contested knowledge new technologies have increasingly featured in environmental conservation conflicts  we examined the deployment of imaging devices such as sonar equipment and cameras to survey the fal estuary in cornwall  uk  due to heavy use of these waters  there have been several disputes coalescing around protected marine features  including the estuary s rare maerl beds  a comparison of two cases  scallop dredging and docks development  showed technical instruments being deployed to produce information about the marine environment as evidence to inform decision making  the use of imaging devices stimulated political action and was regarded as a move away from emotion based decision making towards desired objectivity  simultaneously  however  the process of deploying these devices was challenged and there was recognition that the resultant information could be used to construct the estuary as a politically charged space  thus  rather than clarifying and resolving contentious issues  technological interventions generated new baselines for knowledge contestation and amplified ongoing battles for credibility and authority  
 no cultural revolution  continuity and change in consumption patterns in contemporary china one globalization paradigm argues that developing countries will increasingly resemble western societies  although influenced by western trends  i argue that global consumerism will not make most chinese abandon traditional values and adopt a different and totally western consumer culture  this article  which is based on empirical evidence  stresses the role of culture and how it affects people s strategies toward economic decision making  i explore the changing values before and after the opening up policy  and how they influenced consumption patterns in different eras  the cultural revolution  1966 1976  in china was a campaign designed to pursue a purer form of communism and led to a distinctive set of cultural values and ideologies  resulting in unique consumption patterns   status goods  during this period were based on a person s  revolutionary background  and loyalty to chairman mao  rather than on individual consumption preferences  after the opening up policy  consumer behavior moved closer to the patterns found in western capitalist societies  but the mechanisms that drive this consumption are quite different  chinese traditional values were challenged but did not disappear  and the impact of the cultural revolution also had a profound influence on those who lived through it  contemporary chinese consumers selectively choose certain cultural values from a range of options in order to legitimize their spending decisions

 no longer raising eyebrows  the contexts and domestication of botox as a mundane medical and cultural artefact cosmetic enhancement technologies have been subject to extended sociological and feminist critique  but botulinum neurotoxins  botox  have been sidelined in this discussion  this has occurred despite botox s popularity and accessibility as a non surgical cosmetic procedure  while botox shares many similarities with cosmetic enhancement technologies such as cosmetic surgery  we argue that the fields and the socio spatial organisation of botox   where botox is performed and by whom  which we collectively call contextual botox   not only differentiate it from other cosmetic enhancement technologies but expose how botox has gone beyond normalisation to become hypernormalised  a domesticated  mundane technology that has largely disappeared into the flows and routines of everyday life  in addition  botox is a distinct medical and social practice that is multifaceted  being determined by the contexts in which it is found and the forms of cultural capital therein  it is for these reasons  in addition to being the most popular form of cosmetic enhancement  that botox should be critically scrutinised  
 no rest for the wicked  the consequences of incarceration for sleep problems about one in every five americans suffers from inadequate sleep  a key indicator of physical and mental well being  using data from the national longitudinal study of adolescent health  we investigate the association between incarceration and two related sleep problems  short sleep duration and symptoms of insomnia  we find that relative to those who have not been incarcerated  those with a history of incarceration have an elevated risk of short sleep duration and insomnia symptoms  these associations persist even after controlling for a host of potential confounders  including prior sleep problems  additionally  the associations do not differ significantly across race  
 non economic quality of life and population density in south africa the purpose of this study is to investigate the relationship between population density and non economic quality of life  popular opinion has generally been that population density can be seen as beneficial for economic growth  as it allows for greater productivity  greater incomes and can be translated into higher levels of quality of life  recently though  growing evidence tends to suggest the exact opposite in that increases in productivity and incomes are not translated into better quality of life  as economic or income variables have always played a significant role in this research  questions regarding the relationship between population density and non economic quality of life has largely remained unanswered  in this light  the paper utilises a panel data set on the eight metropolitan cities in south africa for the period 1996 2014 to determine the relationship between population density and non economic quality of life in the south african context  in the analyses we make use of panel estimation techniques which allows us to compare changes in this relationship over time as well as adding a spatial dimension to the results  this paper contributes to the literature by firstly studying the aforementioned relationship over time and secondly conducting the analyses at a sub national level in a developing country  our results show that there is a significant and negative relationship between population density and non economic quality of life  based on our findings policy measures to encourage urbanisation should not be supported if the ultimate outcome is to increase non economic quality of life  
 non gmo vs organic labels  purity or process guarantees in a gmo contaminated landscape since 2010  demand for non gmo food products has grown dramatically  two non gmo labels dominate the market  usda organic and the non gmo project verified  the project   however  the non gmo status of organic is not obvious from the label and many consumers are unaware of this  as sales of products carrying the project s non gmo label have exploded  concern has increased among some organic proponents that demand for non gmo threatens the organic market  in response  both sides are seeking to build legitimacy and authority for their label by emphasizing the value of their standards for determining a food product s non gmo status within a gmo contaminated agrifood system  drawing on in depth interviews with key informants with knowledge of non gmo standards and labels  we examine the knowledge systems  discourses and actors that proponents of the project and usda organic privilege in their effort to legitimize their standards  here  the project emphasizes its application of technoscientific norms  especially thresholds and testing  which they argue provide the best means for preventing gmo contamination and helping consumers find  relative  non gmo  purity   in contrast  proponents of organic favor a process standard that excludes gmos  arguing that non gmo  purity  is unrealistic in today s agrifood system that is widely contaminated by gmos and where mandatory testing would unnecessarily harm organic producers  we conclude that tensions between the two groups are unlikely to be easily reconciled since these two distinct marketing labels rely on different knowledge and verification claims to vie for consumers and increase market share  
 nonparametric multiple imputation for questionnaires with individual skip patterns and constraints  the case of income imputation in the national educational panel study large scale surveys typically exhibit data structures characterized by rich mutual dependencies between surveyed variables and individual specific skip patterns  despite high efforts in fieldwork and questionnaire design  missing values inevitably occur  one approach for handling missing values is to provide multiply imputed data sets  thus enhancing the analytical potential of the surveyed data  to preserve possible nonlinear relationships among variables and incorporate skip patterns that make the full conditional distributions individual specific  we adapt a full conditional multiple imputation approach based on sequential classification and regression trees  individual specific skip patterns and constraints are handled within imputation in a way ensuring the consistency of the sequence of full conditional distributions  the suggested approach is illustrated in the context of income imputation in the adult cohort of the national educational panel study  
 norwegian national day oratory  constructing and reconstructing a national we national day speeches play an explicit part in defining national identities  in this article  we examine how mayors in norwegian municipalities reflect on norway s increased diversity in their 17 may speeches  national day speeches in norway are supposed to focus on unity  not conflict  yet  what have they become in the context of diversity  in applying theoretical perspectives on nations  rituals and language to data consisting of a selection of speeches  our analysis identifies themes that structure a typical 17 may speech  we explore the use of plural pronouns in the speeches and how they make norwegian national identity more or less accessible for people with minority backgrounds  by including ethnic minorities in national day rhetoric  the speakers negotiate who belongs in the norwegian community in a less directly political way than in everyday life  yet  whilst the genre is celebratory  the national day speeches also echo different political attitudes towards diversity and integration  
 nostalgia  myth  nationalism  the postcolonial nostalgia for  british  cyprus this study opens up a vista onto the notion popular among a growing number of turkish cypriots that the british colonial period brought modernist enlightenment to turkish cypriots  having been subject to heavy turkish immigration from 1974  the turkish military intervention into the island  onwards as well as the  dictating  turkish nationalism by turkish authorities over the native politics and value system  turkish cypriots have harkened back nostalgically to the british colonization for the universal standards of  metahistoric  civilization  in doing so  turkish cypriots structured a nostalgic nationalist movement called cypriotism  an  identity of difference  that stands in opposition to the so called  backward  immigrants to the island from turkey and turkish nationalism  using postcolonial nationalist theory this study critically analyses the constructions of nostalgic nationalism in local turkish cypriot media in the light of historic landmarks and milestones  
 not such smart tourism  the concept of e lienation the concept of alienation was adapted to tourism by maccannell who identified it as a key feature of modernity and a strong driver of tourism where tourists seek to reconnect to authentic places and selves  meanwhile the post modern world has witnessed a revolution in information and communication technology  ict  especially in the realm of smart tourism where its advocates talk eagerly of the internet of everything  such a totalising prospect demands serious review and this article fills a critical gap by conceptualising the idea of e lienation as a specific form of alienation in ict enabled tourism  it combines philosophic questions of meaning  sociological theory and empirical research to demonstrate the meanings of e lienation  its dimensions  causes  consequences and strategies of resistance   c  2017 elsevier ltd  all rights reserved  
 now or never  smoking cessation discussions in the face of serious illness sociological research on medical discussions of lifestyle suggests that smoking patients may be seen as knowingly causing their medical problems  therefore  it may be interactionally problematic for doctors to raise the issue of smoking cessation in relation to patients  serious health problems  while a serious illness can be expected to bring to the fore the relevance of smoking cessation advice  it may also give rise to questions about patients  right to treatment  this study uses conversation analysis to explicate how patients and doctors manage issues of responsibility in smoking cessation discussions in the face of a serious medical problem that strongly correlates with smoking  the findings show that whilst ill health can be referred to in a confrontational manner  it can also give smoking cessation a now or never  status that downplays patients  responsibility for not having quit before  based on these findings  the paper concludes that for warranting further smoking cessation advice  how doctors and patients verbalise the link between smoking and a serious medical problem matters more than whether they do so  
 observing environmental destruction stimulates neural activation in networks associated with empathic responses the negative impacts of environmental disruption disproportionately affect marginalized and underprivileged communities  thus  the degree to which society is complicit in allowing unchecked environmental destruction to occur has important social justice applications  although decades of research have sought to understand factors which determine acceptance of environmental destruction  most of this research has been based on self report surveys  in the present work  we used neuroimaging techniques to examine the neural correlates of environmental concern  to do this  we compared responses to observing suffering dogs with responses to observing suffering ecosystems  our results extend previous findings which had shown largely overlapping neural response patterns to observing animal and human suffering  critically  we found activation in regions previously identified as active in empathy processes in response to viewing harm to ecosystems  i e   without any animals present in the images   we also found relative differences in response patterns between the two types of stimuli  witnessing harm to environments  vs  dog suffering  led to reduced activation in some regions  but similar activation in others  we discuss these findings in terms of their potential implications for behavioral interventions and possibilities for continued neuroimaging research examining neural responses to environmental ecosystems and other nonhuman entities  
 observing facts and values  a brief theory and history not acknowledging the history and metaphysics of the fact value distinction has led to confusion about the difference between the normative and the cognitive  and disputes on whether there are ways to move from one side  facts  to the other  values  one solution is to recognize values as more objective than facts  and thus blur the common way of drawing this distinction  the origin of the distinction between facts and values appears in the space between them  when and where it is uncertain whether an observation becomes fact or value  once values turn into subjective beliefs  the entire distinction collapses  and modernity begins to end  
 observing others  anger and guilt can make you feel unfairly treated  the interpersonal effects of emotions on justice related reactions drawing upon emotions as social information theory  we propose that others  emotions can influence individuals  justice judgments  outcome satisfaction  and behaviors even when individuals are not unfairly treated themselves and in the absence of explicit information about the fairness of others  treatment  study 1 demonstrated that individuals make inferences about the outcome favorability and procedural justice encountered by others based on others  expressions of guilt and anger  which also influence individuals  judgments of others  overall justice and outcome satisfaction  studies 2 and 3 demonstrated that others  emotions can influence individuals  own judgments of procedural justice and overall justice  specifically  individuals perceive lower levels of justice when another person expresses guilt or anger relative to no emotion  moreover  others  emotions influence individuals  outcome satisfaction and behaviors  i e   helping intentions and retaliation   these effects are mediated by individuals  own justice judgments  i e   procedural and overall justice   theoretical implications related to the role of emotions as antecedents to justice judgments  the social function of emotions  and the impact of emotions on third party observers are discussed  
 occupy the government  analyzing presidential and congressional discursive response to movement repression i examine the role of occupy wall street in shifting presidential and congressional discourse on economic fairness and inequality  using data from 4646 presidential speeches and 1256 congressional records from 2009 to 2015  i test different mechanisms  including repression  media coverage  public opinion  and presidential agenda setting by applying a novel combination of web scraping  natural language processing  and time series models  i suggest that movement success can be measured in its ability to shape discursive opportunity structures  and i argue that the role of the president should be at the forefront of social movements research  ultimately  i demonstrate  1  that the repression of occupy protesters not only predicts media coverage but also increases discursive opportunities through president obama and congress   2  that media coverage of occupy predicts presidential discourse   3  that the president s rhetorical shift increases congressional response  and  4  that this change persists after the movement faltered   c  2017 elsevier inc  all rights reserved

 old wine  new bottle  comparing interpersonal bullying and cyberbullying victimization this study uses a large nationally representative sample to compare and contrast interpersonal bullying and cyberbullying by asking the following questions   a  how does the prevalence of cyberbullying victimization compare with the prevalence of interpersonal bullying victimization   b  how does the relationship between demographic predictors and cyberbullying victimization compare with the relationship between these predictors and interpersonal bullying victimization  and  c  how does the relationship between cyberbullying victimization and avoidance behaviors compare with the relationship between interpersonal bullying victimization and avoidance behaviors  findings demonstrate that interpersonal bullying victimization is far more prevalent than cyberbullying victimization  results also illustrate differences in the relationships between demographics and bullying victimization  finally  students who are a victim of either form of bullying are more likely to engage in school avoidance behaviors  these results highlight the need for comprehensive and preventive programs that can reduce the negative consequences of bullying victimization  
 on authoritarianism  a review essay a product of the nineteenth century age of isms  authoritarianism describes a worldview that promotes the establishment of a hierarchical relation whereby one person or group dominates and governs another without recourse to either physical force or persuasion  authoritarianism is the advocacy of authority as a source or origin that compels voluntary obedience without question  a person has authority if he or she can command someone to do something without having to do anything other than issue a command  which is to say that the person who obeys recognizes the authority of the person who commands as legitimate or correct  the word authority comes from the latin  auctoritas  which cicero employs to characterize the distinctive influence of the senate in ancient rome  power is with the people  authority with the senate  whereas power  potestas  is political and relies on force or persuasion to command obedience  authority enjoys unequivocal obedience as a source beyond the contested realm of politics

 on estimating achievement dynamic models from repeated cross sections despite the increasing spread of standardized assessments of student learning  longitudinal data on achievement data are still lacking in many countries  this article raises the following question  can we exploit cross sectional assessments held at different schooling stages to evaluate how achievement inequalities related to individual ascribed characteristics develop over time  this is a highly policy relevant issue  as achievement inequalities may develop in substantially different ways across educational systems  we discuss the issues involved in estimating dynamic models from repeated cross sectional surveys in this context  consistently with a simple learning accumulation model  we propose an imputed regression strategy that allows to link two surveys and deliver consistent estimates of the parameters of interest  we then apply the method to italian achievement data of fifth and sixth graders and investigate how inequalities develop between primary and lower secondary school  
 on the advancement of therapeutic penality  therapeutic authority  personality science and the therapeutic community in this article i examine the advancement of therapeutic penality in the uk  a penal philosophy that reimagines prison policy  practices and environments utilising psychological knowledge  adopting a historical approach  i show how modern therapeutic penality is linked to the emergence of personality science in the nineteenth century and the development of the democratic therapeutic community  dtc  model in the twentieth century  i outline how at the turn of the twenty first century a catalytic event generated a moral panic that led the british government to mobilise psychological knowledge and technologies in an attempt to manage dangerous people with severe personality disorder  tracing subsequent developments  i argue psychological ways of talking  thinking and acting have obtained unparalleled salience in domains of penality and  in turn  radically transformed the conditions of imprisonment  
 on the character and production of  active participation  in neuro rehabilitation  an actor network perspective the importance of patients  active involvement in neuro rehabilitation after acquired brain injury has been consistently emphasised in recent years  however  most approaches fail to show how active participation  is practically enacted  focusing on individualised explanations of patient choice and behaviours  or notions of inherent patient traits  using actor network theory  ant  as a sensitising concept  we investigated neuro rehabilitation practices  asking how participation is shaped through biological and socio material specificities  how rights to knowledge and expertise are constructed  and how a body acclimatises and adjusts within an order of participation and transformation  we analysed video recorded fieldwork extracts  examining the work of adjusting  testing and transforming  the construction of competence and incompetence  and material and social processes involved in the division of the body and its re composition  our findings show how an ant sensitised approach provides a critical understanding and context specific characterisation of active participation   produced through the association of heterogeneous actors at any one time  such specificity and the distribution of work suggest that efforts to account for optimum therapy dosages   and clinical attention to establishing individually located levels of self efficacy  or motivation  are misdirected  the performance of active participation   rather  should be re imagined as a product of diverse  mutually attuned entities  a virtual abstract of this paper can be viewed at  
 on the international review for the sociology of sport  the field of play  and six years of more  more than less  in this editorial essay  editor in chief lawrence wenner reflects on his six year tenure editing the international review for the sociology of sport and the sociology of sport as a scholarly field of play  thanks are given to the many in the sociology of sport community who have supported the irss and contributed to its success  consideration then turns to the imprimatur of the irss and a series of identity struggles evident in the scholarly community  using the framing of the naming of the irss  the essay poses that the irss is more than each of the constituent parts making up the journal s title  in considering how the irss is more than international  arguments are advanced that most socio cultural studies of sport tend to focus on local  regional  and national sporting experiences and that the irss might be better characterized as multinational or multi vocal in its orientation  in considering how the irss is more than a review  arguments are advanced that the irss has always gone beyond featuring critical articles  a chief technical characteristic marking publications as reviews  in considering how the irss is more than sociology  arguments are advanced that the socio cultural study of sport has always necessarily reached beyond sociology in engaging a host of disciplines  related consideration is given to the current status of socio cultural inquiry about sport  sociology  the sport sciences  and management  in considering how the irss is more than sport  arguments are advanced about the how the socio cultural study of sport has always had boundaries that blur with the study of physical activity that engages fitness  health  and recreation  finally  the essay closes with consideration of physical cultural studies and poses that it is deficient as an alternative characterization of the scholarly community  
 on the reflexivity of crises  lessons from critical theory and systems theory the main aim of this article is to offer a sociological concept of crisis that  defined as the expected yet non lineal outcome of the internal dynamics of modern societies  builds on the synergies between critical theory and systems theory  it contends that  notwithstanding important differences  both traditions concur in addressing crises as a form of self reproduction of social systems as much as a form of engagement with the complexities and effects of such processes of reproduction  in order to make our comparison exhaustive  this article explores critical and systems theories  notions of crisis at three levels   1  their conceptual delimitation of crises   2  their methodological proposals to empirically observe crises  and  3  their normative attempts to contribute to their resolution  as crises remain a distinctive structural feature of the social world and a rich source of knowledge about it  reflexivity must be seen as a crucial form of engagement with the negative expressions of social life itself  
 otherwise than being with  levinas on heidegger and community in this article i argue that levinas can be read as a critic  not just of heideggerian being  but also of being with  after pointing out that the publication of the black notebooks only makes this criticism more interesting to revisit  i first of all discuss passages from both earlier and later writings in which levinas explicitly takes issue with heidegger s claim that there is no self outside of a specific socio historical community  i then explain how these criticisms are reflected in levinas s own account  arguing that levinasian subjectivity and alterity are precisely defined by their not belonging to a larger unity  to the extent that they partake in a multi personal collectivity  this does not take the form of a traditional community  in the final section  i look into a different and seemingly opposing argument levinas makes against heidegger  on the basis of the latter s reflections on death  he argues that dasein is anti social rather than overly immersed in the socio historical  arguing that this rests on a misreading of being and time  i use this opportunity to raise questions about levinas s interpretation of heidegger and his  otherwise than being with  more generally  for levinas s account runs into several problems as well  yet as i will conclude  this in fact offers a valuable insight  not just for the present day reception of heidegger  but also for thinking community today  it indicates that a radical break with human situatedness does not automatically fare better than a firmly enrooted account of  co existence  
 overeducation  skills and wage penalty  evidence for spain using piaac data the literature on educational mismatches finds that overeducated workers suffer a wage penalty compared with properly educated workers with the same level of education  recent literature also suggests that individuals  skill heterogeneity could explain wage differences between overeducated and properly matched workers  the hypothesis is that overeducated workers earn less due to their lower competences and skills in relative terms  however  that hypothesis has been rarely tested due to data limitations on individuals  skills  the aim of this paper is to test the individuals  skill heterogeneity theory in spain using microdata from piaac  because it is one of the developed countries supporting the highest overeducation rates and where its adult population holds the lowest level of skills among a set of developed countries  our hypothesis is that the wage penalty of overeducation in spain is explained by the lower skill level of overeducated workers  the obtained evidence confirms this hypothesis but only to a certain extent as skills only explain partially the wage penalty of overeducation  
 overlapping crime  stability and specialization of co offending relationships dyadic analyses of relationships between criminals have mostly ignored the multiplex nature of criminal ties  this study attempts to provide a more complete assessment of co offending networks by incorporating the different types of crime that relate individuals with each other  drawing on a large dataset of arrests in quebec between 2003 and 2009  we focus on co offending stability and specialization and illustrate how co offending networks based on different types of criminal activities overlap  we portray a pattern of co offending  which extends debate of criminal specialization versatility to the dyadic level  our study illustrates the ways in which the frequency and spectrum of crime include a relational component  more generally  the article emphasizes the need to consider the semantics of network ties  and further  the association between different types of networks  which ultimately offers a reassessment of social structure   c  2017 elsevier b v  all rights reserved  
 overseeing criminal justice  the supervisory role of the public prosecution service in china the chinese public prosecution service  the procuracy  is modelled on the soviet union system and has been accorded the controversial function of supervising other legal institutions in the criminal justice system  drawing upon my own empirical data on the prosecution of crime in china  this article critically examines the way the power of supervision operates from an internal perspective  it argues that the power of supervision has been used as an institutional asset to secure the interests of the procuracy by analysing its oversight of police investigations and court decisions  the way prosecutors perceive themselves  and the efficacy of the supervision in a comparative context  the current status of the procuracy dictates that it is unable to undertake the role of supervision to safeguard the criminal process  
 parental incarceration and the transition to adulthood the growing literature on the intergenerational consequences of incarceration generally neglects to consider how paternal and maternal incarceration structures offspring s transition to adulthood  a fundamental life course stage that has become increasingly unequal  in this article  the authors use data from the national longitudinal study of adolescent to adult health to explore the relationship between parental incarceration and both subjective  e g   respondent feels older compared to others his or her age  and behavioral  e g   respondent is a parent  indicators of adulthood transitions among respondents younger than age 24  n 10 937   the results suggest that both paternal and maternal incarceration is positively associated with the number of subjective and behavioral adulthood transitions  the results also suggest that parental incarceration is associated with some individual indicators  especially subjective indicators  of adulthood  taken together  these findings highlight that the high incarceration rate in the united states has transformative intergenerational consequences  
 parental modeling and deidentification in romantic relationships among mexican origin youth this study investigated youth s modeling of and deidentification from parents in romantic relationships using two phases of data from adolescent siblings  mothers  and fathers in 246 mexican origin families  each parent reported his and her marital satisfaction and conflict  and youth reported on parent adolescent warmth and conflict at time 1  youth s reports of modeling of and deidentification from their mothers and fathers and three romantic relationship outcomes were assessed at time 2  findings revealed that higher parental marital satisfaction  lower marital conflict  and higher warmth and lower conflict in parent adolescent relationships were associated with more modeling and less deidentification from parents  moreover  higher deidentification was linked to a greater likelihood of youth being involved in a romantic relationship and cohabitation  whereas more modeling was linked to a lower likelihood of cohabitation and older age of first sex  discussion underscores the importance of assessing parental modeling and deidentification and understanding correlates of these processes  
 parents as researchers  collaborative ethnography with parents this article describes a series of studies of young children s experience of place in which parents acted as co researchers  collecting and analysing data  this approach to research resulted in an emphasis on sensory engagement and embodied experience  for both adults and children  as my own young daughter accompanied me during this research  the boundaries between parent and researcher were further blurred  as research progressed  parents became increasingly critical of pathologising discourses about parenting  and stated more strongly the expertise they possessed in their own children  collaborative research with parents opened up new possibilities for understanding the perspectives of very young children  by drawing on the expertise parents have  
 participatory skepticism  ambivalence and conflict in popular discourses of participatory democracy in recent years researches have focused on the preferences of ordinary citizens towards democratic deepening  asking  do people want more institutional participation  the present work analyzes how different classes of people envisage a participatory democracy and its problems  supported by qualitative research based on 16 focus groups conducted in spain between 2011 and 2013  it is shown that skepticism plays a central role in the views of participatory democracy  doubts surrounding its viability  negative expectations on the responsiveness of governments and  overall  distrust of the capacities of ordinary citizens  contribute to skepticism  in some groups these beliefs lead to a rejection of participatory reforms  in other groups  participants harbor hopes and positive prospects  for them  the key point is faith in education as a shortcut to political equality  
 partisan strength  political trust and generalized trust in the united states  an analysis of the general social survey  1972 2014 the literature on political parties suggests that strong partisan identities are associated with citizens  effective interaction with the political system  and with higher levels of political trust  traditionally  party identity therefore is seen as a mechanism that allows for political integration  simultaneously  however  political parties have gained recent attention for their role in promoting societal polarization by reinforcing competing and even antagonistic group identities  this article uses general social survey data from 1972   2014 to investigate the relationship between partisan strength and both political and generalized trust  the findings show that increases in partisan strength are positively related to political trust  but negatively related to generalized trust  this suggests that while partisan strength is indeed an important linkage mechanism for the political system  it is also associated with a tendency toward social polarization  and this corrosive effect thus far has not gained sufficient attention in literature on party identity   c  2017 elsevier inc  all rights reserved  
 paths to success of israeli immigrants from different countries of origin this study is a case study of paths of success across different immigrant groups in the same national context  it investigated dimensions of immigrants  success and explored paths of success of immigrants from different countries of origin  two main dimensions of immigrants  success were outlined  economic success and psychological well being  when the latter included  sense of belonging  and  life satisfaction   an instrument measuring both dimensions of success was developed  the study was based on data from the 2011 immigrant survey completed by a representative sample of the immigrant population in israel  including 2927 immigrants from the former soviet union  asia   africa  europe   america  and ethiopia  structural equation modeling were used to generate the model of immigrants  success  the main paths of success were outlined  the path of the low skilled visible minority contrasted with the path of other  more highly skilled groups of immigrants who resembled the local majority population to a greater degree  understanding factors shaping the success of immigrants from different countries of origin might be used by policymakers to foster immigrants  economic and psychological well being  
 pathways to adolescents  flourishing  linking self control skills and positivity ratio through social support this study focused on the ability to experience a high ratio of positive to negative emotions in 807 israeli adolescents aged 12 to 15 years  50  girls   while considering possible gender differences  we tested a model positing that adolescents  self control skills would link to their positivity ratio and indirectly through perceived social support from parents and classmates  parental support was significantly higher than classmate support  and girls scored significantly higher than boys on self control skills and on both support sources  self control skills linked directly with positivity ratio and indirectly through parents  and classmates  support  with no gender differences found for the overall model  the study highlights the importance of prevention and treatment programs designed to impart adolescents with prosocial self control skills  to improve their perceived availability of social support and consequently to increase their positivity ratio during this intense developmental period  
 pathways to professionalism  quality improvement  care pathways  and the interplay of standardisation and clinical autonomy care pathways are a prominent feature of efforts to improve healthcare quality  outcomes and accountability  but sociological studies of pathways often find professional resistance to standardisation  this qualitative study examined the adoption and adaptation of a novel pathway as part of a randomised controlled trial in an unusually complex  non linear field   emergency general surgery   by teams of surgeons and physicians in six theoretically sampled sites in the uk  we find near universal receptivity to the concept of a pathway as a means of improving peri operative processes and outcomes  but concern about the impact on appropriate professional judgement  however  this concern translated not into resistance and implementation failure  but into a nuancing of the pathways as realised in each site  and their use as a means of enhancing professional decision making and inter professional collaboration  we discuss our findings in the context of recent literature on the interplay between managerialism and professionalism in healthcare  and highlight practical and theoretical implications  
 patterns of time use across the life span in korea  a latent class analysis and age and gender differences the purpose of this study was to gain an understanding of time use and the patterns of time use across the life span using a socioemotional selectivity theory  the data used for this study were from the  korean time use survey   which is collected every 5 years by statistics korea  kostat   the data collected in 1999  2004  and 2009 were used to analyze the patterns of time use using latent class analyses and to observe the differences of time use by age and gender  the results were summarized as follows  based on the analyses of nine behavior classifications  after sleep and personal care  korean allocated more time in daily activities to relationship and leisure time  followed by education  paid work  and household management  with the order differing between each age group and gender  three different classes of time use were classified at each age group  education centered time use was revealed to be mainly in the young  paid work centered in the middle aged  and relationship and leisure centered in older adults  we find significant gender differences  men s patterns of time did not change markedly across the 3 years  while women s patterns have shifted  meanwhile  in the age 65 and older group  paid work appeared alongside as well as leisure among most prominent activities  were appeared as dominant forms of time use  this phenomenon is closely related to reflecting high rates of elderly poverty in korea  further discussions concerning the time use by age and gender were provided and countermeasures for changing time use in later life were discussed  
 paying with change  the purposeful enunciation of material culture recent work in cultural sociology has called attention to constraints imposed by material objects on interpretive processes  but is unclear as to how actors use such constraints to produce new meanings  in this article  we use novel newspaper data of people attempting to pay with large amounts of small cash and coins as a form of protest to highlight the material conditions under which actors are able to convey an alternative meaning of an object to an audience  we use computational linguistic and quantitative methods to examine when changes in the meaning of money are more likely to lead to emotionally charged media reception  we find that emotionally charged media reception is more likely when  typically  actors consciously attend to money and yet do not have to put in much cognitive work to assign meaning to it in the setting where the protest is attempted  we conclude by considering the implications of the study for broader projects within cultural sociology  economic sociology  organizational theory  political sociology  and social movement studies  
 peer mentoring and intercultural understanding  support for refugee background and immigrant students beginning university study this study explored the effects of the equity buddies program  an intercultural cross level mentoring course designed to link more advanced university students  as mentors  with first year refugee background or immigrant students  it was designed to address the needs of refugee background and immigrant students as they transitioned into university culture  the data included mentors  written reflections  log books  and a brief demographic survey  through the processes adopted in the course  it was found that cross cultural pairing influenced mentors  intercultural understandings  enabled cross cultural relationships to develop and provided opportunities for students to interact with people of other cultures and religions  mentors changed their views of others   of immigrants  of refugees  and also of anglo australians  they experienced increased personalised understanding or gained a widened perspective of their mentees who were of cultures different from their own  mentors stated that over time their interactions evolved into either a mutually rewarding friendship or a comfortable relationship within a learning community that valued collective learning  it is proposed that increased intercultural understanding emerges from an increased emphasis on the creation of meaningful  transactional relationships among culturally diverse students within a supportive academic environment  
 peers and fertility preferences  an empirical investigation of the role of neighbours  religion and education individual fertility preference is influenced by observed social norms  the present paper investigates the effect of the observed fertility of peers on a woman s fertility preference  we explore the role of two peer groups  neighbourhood peers and religious peers  data from the national family health surveys  1992 1993  1998 1999 and 2005 2006  in india is employed for empirical estimations using a multinomial logit model  we find that both neighbourhood and religious peers have a significant impact on individual fertility preferences  but their relative importance changes with family size  an increase in peer fertility increases the probability of preferring more children  we further examine the roles of education and wealth as transmission channels between the fertility norms of peers to the fertility preferences of the women and find that education plays an important role in moderating peer influences  these findings can serve as vital inputs in formulating family planning and gender policies  
 people  patches  and parasites  the case of trypanosomiasis in zimbabwe understanding the socio ecology of disease requires careful attention to the role of patches within disease landscapes  such patches  and the interfaces between different socio epidemiological systems  we argue  have important implications for disease control  we conducted an interdisciplinary study over three years to investigate the spatial dynamics of human and animal trypanosomiasis in the zambezi valley  zimbabwe  we used a habitat niche model to identify changes in suitable habitat for tsetse fly vectors over time  and this is related to local villagers  understandings of where flies are found  fly trapping and blood dna analysis of livestock highlighted the patchy distribution of both flies and trypanosome parasites  through livelihoods analysis we explored who makes use of what areas of the landscape and when  identifying the social groups most at risk  we conclude with a discussion of the practical implications  including the need for an integrated  one health  approach involving targeted approaches to both vector control and surveillance  
 people centered liberalism  an alternative approach to international state building in sierra leone and liberia efforts to build stable states in africa have often been conditioned by ideological and policy debates about the right approach for enhancing freedom and social wellbeing  since independence  african countries have experimented with unorthodox variants of liberalism and socialism  however  neither of these has enhanced african states  this article examines the shift from orthodox neoliberalism in the international approach to state building in africa and raises questions about the feasibility of an international development approach that fuses neoliberalism with a human development approach  the article advances the notion of people centered liberalism as the latest approach to international state building in war torn african countries  it uses the internationally driven postwar reconstruction plans for sierra leone and liberia to demonstrate people centered liberalism  
 perceived civil rights and moral competence in iranian adults civil rights theories upon which this study is based are the conviction  social change and culture s constraints theories of civil rights  whilst moral competence has been considered from the perspective of moral intelligence  moral competence and dual aspect theories of morality  the purpose of this study was to investigate the relationship between perceived civil rights and moral competence  to analyze the role of perceived civil rights in the prediction of moral competence  and to investigate the role of gender on these constructs in a sample of iranian adults  the randomly selected sample consisted of 400 adult participants  m   190 and f   210  from the cities of abadeh  bavanat  eghlid and khorambid  the north of fars province  iran  a demographic questionnaire  the perceived civil rights scale  pcrs  and the moral competency inventory  mci  were used in this study  findings showed that perceived civil rights and its subscales had significant relationships to the mci and its subscales  the personal space subscale of perceived civil rights predicted 18   of the total of the moral competency s variability in this sample  it was also found that males had higher scores on the free confession and testimony subscale of perceived civil rights  whilst females had higher scores on the standing up for rightness subscale of moral competency  
 perceiving reconciliation  child care policies and gendered time conflicts in recent decades  many studies have examined gender related differences in paid employment and the reconciliation of family and employment  considering perceptions of time conflicts with regards to work at home and leisure activities  this article contributes to a more encompassing understanding of attitudes toward reconciliation problems  special attention is given to the role of external child care services  the use of an original data set from 60 swiss municipalities and hierarchical multiresponse regression models enable an analysis of the various aspects of time conflicts simultaneously  and a consideration of how different policy contexts shape these attitudes  this study provides evidence that the communal provision of external child care is related to gender specific perceptions of time conflicts  most interestingly  men seem to be affected most strongly by communal policy conditions  whereby the provision of external child care is related to systematically higher levels of time conflicts  
 perception or reality  the relationship between stereotypes  discrimination  and the academic outcomes of african american male college athletes the current study examined the degree to which stereotypes and racial discrimination affected the academic outcomes of african american male college athletes  furthermore  the ability of athletic identity and racial identity to moderate this relationship was examined  participants  n   168  were recruited from 13 predominately white institutions across the united states  results indicated a tipping point by which negative stereotypes and discrimination moved from having a positive effect to a negative effect on the academic achievement  in addition  certain dimensions of athletic and racial discrimination were found to moderate the relationship between stereotypes and discrimination and academic outcomes  findings are discussed in relation to theoretical and practical significance

 performing the national territory  the geography of national day celebrations the nation is a relatively abstract imagined community that is visualised through a variety of symbols as well as communicative and performative practices  in this paper  we explore how the national territory  one of the foundations of the nation state  is performed on national day celebrations and brings the nation into being  drawing on ethnographic research on national days in burkina faso  cote d ivoire and ghana  we show how the state s internal administrative divisions and ethnic differences are at once made explicit but also subordinated to the nation  moreover  we show how in such celebrations  potentially disruptive or competing affiliations such as ethnicity and regional loyalties are re imagined  both the rotation of the central celebration and its replication all over the national territory carry the nation into the regions and integrate the regions into the nation state  the co memoration  turns participants and spectators from locals into national compatriots and thus not only performs nationality but also performs the relationship among nation  state and citizen  set within a particular territory  
 personal collections as material assemblages  a comparison of wardrobes and music collections this article takes the case studies of music and clothing collections in the home to explore the possibilities for developing comparative research into everyday consumption by focusing upon personal collections  drawing on two empirical research projects  it challenges dominant understandings of collections as  special  or separated off from daily practices by considering music and clothing collections as the site for everyday consumption practices as well as the locus of memories  collections are reframed as  assemblages  to explore the diverse materialities and temporalities that constitute the collections  agency is distributed through the assemblage which allows for a problematisation of notions of individual consumer choice as the article explores the logics of the collections themselves  focusing upon  collections  paves the way for comparative work on different genres of consumption and to explore the diverse materialities of things and their relationalities  it widens our understanding of consumption to incorporate the use of things both in the enactment of daily life and which are kept or stored  
 personal memories of participants of the croatian war of independence based on the analysis of in depth interviews of oral history with 50 participants of the croatian war of independence  this article aims to analyze  comprehend and explain meanings which these 50 participants attribute to the croatian war of independence  the article examines the construction of the personal memories of those social actors who did not have political power during the period of war  and the central focus is placed on the social and cultural circumstances that influence the construction of personal wartime narratives  the article discusses and ultimately concludes that the personal narratives are largely witness to the previously planned  aggressive and genocidal nature of serbian politics led by slobodan milosevic which served as the cause and start of the croatian war of independence  furthermore  personal narratives reveal the large scale destruction of croatian cities during the war  urbicide and culturocide   and the distancing of interpersonal  inter  national  relationships as a consequence of the war  ultimately  although multilayered in their narrative explications  the personal narratives of people who experienced the croatian war of independence are compatible with the concept of the croatian war of independence as an aggression towards croatia  with the aim of destruction of the croatian national identity and conquest of croatian territory  
 peter berger s  many altars  and the theology of religions my notes on peter berger s recent publication  berger 2014  come in two parts  in part one  i will address a couple of conceptual ambiguities surrounding the so called  secularization theory   in part two  i will deal with berger s argument that religious diversity undermines religious certainties and in that sense fosters secularization  as i will point out  theologians are not only well aware of this situation  they are discussing it as part of the so called  theology of religions   and they have identified a solution that avoids what berger rightly characterizes as the two impasses of fundamentalism and relativism  
 philosophy for making peace with children  an incentive for creativity banking pedagogy has always enjoyed a privileged position at schools  however  current societies demand alternative pedagogical models  which promote  on the one hand  greater participation of children  and on the other  dialogues to prompt reflection on topics alien to the contents of the classic school curriculum  according to a descriptive methodology that is based on critical analysis  freire s liberation pedagogy is retaken in this text with the objective of proposing a philosophy for peace making with children in order to stimulate their critical  ethical and creative thinking on questions related to peacebuilding and peaceful conflict transformation  so  philosophy for making peace is understood as a liberation pedagogy that maintains most of the characteristics of the community of philosophical enquiry thought by lipman and in which creativity has an essential role  
 place attachment and empowerment  do residents need to be attached to be empowered  within resident attitude research  place attachment and empowerment are two of the most prominent non economic constructs used to explain residents  attitudes toward tourism  this research explores the relationship between the two and whether residents  perceptions of place identity  place dependence and nature bonding affect perceptions of being empowered through tourism  the relationship is tested within the rural destination of choczewo  poland  results reveal that place identity  place dependence  and nature bonding directly influence residents  perceptions of psychological and social empowerment through tourism  however  only place dependence predicts residents  ability to feel politically empowered through tourism  results from this study extend the model of residents  attitudes toward tourism by explaining how societal factors such as resident bonding with the socio physical environment enable residents to become more empowered through tourism development   c  2017 elsevier ltd  all rights reserved  
 placeholders and changemakers  women farmland owners navigating gendered expectations gendered expectations are central to the continuation of agricultural land tenure systems that concentrate land and power in the control of men  these expectations about how land should be used and by whom are communicated through cultural narratives and maintained through social interactions  through analysis of qualitative data collected through in depth interviews with women farmland owners in iowa  this article identifies a pivotal person without whom the success of these stories is in jeopardy  the placeholder  in this article  i identify how cultural narratives place two gendered expectations on women in the placeholder position   1  that women landowners maintain farmland through the continuance of its use and preexisting land agreements with tenants or co owners  and  2  that women landowners defer their authority as landowners to men  further  i identify the changemaker as an emerging character within cultural narrativesone who refuses to fit the expectations of placeholder and whose behavior may or may not be accepted by the community  finally  i find that alternative social networks provide enabling environments for changemakers as sites of potential narrative revisions or shifts  
 placing  home  and  family  in rural residential mobilities this article aims to examine rural population residential movements through a mobilities perspective to provide an inclusive analysis of the diverse processes of movement that  re produce rural places beyond the dominant counter urbanisation narrative  we seek to contribute to the literature in two ways  firstly  we examine a sample of rural residents who have moved house within a 10 year period to examine the full range of actually existing residential mobilities  including counter urbanisation  lateral in migration and local mobility within an irish context  we suggest that counter urbanisation provides only a partial explanation of rural mobility accounting for 44 per cent of our recent movers   moreover  within the counter urbanisation group  approximately a half of this group were originally from a rural context suggesting a more nuanced return to roots  movement rather than a stereotypical urban rural movement  secondly  we explore two relatively new dimensions of rural mobilities   the importance of the actual house characteristics to where respondents moved to and the pull of family networks as key mobility factors  in the irish context explored in this article  we argue that rather than a search for greenspace and idyllic landscapes  decision making is often driven by a desire for more private space  internal and external  and the presence of existing family networks  
 plastic naturecultures  multispecies ethnography and the dangers of separating living from nonliving bodies a jellyfish surrounds a plastic fragment  merging the synthetic material with its body  a water agency poster warns of dangerous plastic bottle fish  in the mediterranean  marine organisms take shelter on and under synthetic materials  these are the denizens of a growing realm marine ecologists call the plastisphere   where sea life and plastics meet  building upon multispecies ethnography  science and technology studies interrogations of nature culture divides and the practical work of classification  this article explores the indeterminacy   the very plasticity   of the category of species  as it is engaged in seriousness and irony  with living and nonliving bodies  first  i draw on participant observation at a nonprofit marine institute laboratory in california to trace the travels of plastic creatures through attempts to disentangle them in the pursuit of scientific knowledge  here volunteers sort tiny plastic bits from animal ones under the microscope  enacting material boundaries as they decide what gets counted as life  not plastic  and what does not  plastic   second  i follow movements of plastic creatures through public education campaigns  paying particular attention to assumptions about belonging and agency enacted with assumptions about whether and when plastic species should or should not meet  i argue that the danger  of plastic relationships lurks not in associations but in the very categories used to know and live with forms of plastic and forms of life  in the kinds of belonging that emerge with kinds of materials  and in the failure to recognize the impossibility of their separation  
 pluralism in the mind and the structure of cognitive minorities in his book the many altars of modernity peter l  berger  2014  called for the replacement of secularization theory  which in his view no longer has much relevance today  with a theory of  religious  pluralism  such a theory must encompass two levels  the level of the mind and the level of society  in this paper i will focus on the level of mind and explain some of the conceptual linkages with the level of society which berger only touches upon in his book  the paper s main purpose  however  is to sketch out a framework in which berger s ideas on  pluralism in the mind  could be investigated empirically  i will argue to focus on  cognitive minorities   that is  on groups of people whose understanding of the world differs significantly from that of their social environment  as concrete cases i suggest a comparative study of a religious group  evangelical protestants  in a strongly secularized city  leipzig  germany  and a group of skeptics and seekers  unitarians  in a city characterized by evangelical religiosity  dallas  texas   with the help of these settings   that is my thesis   it will be possible to investigate what berger formulated as the central issue in his pluralism theory  how is it possible for people to integrate religious and secular worldviews in their minds  more or less simultaneously   
 policing the nation  acculturation and street level bureaucrats in professional life assimilation of migrants is assumed to happen through acculturation  which is depicted as neutral  unintended and invisible  in most accounts the role of social actors is pushed into the background  and the conditions that shape and determine the direction of the acculturation are ignored  a further critique of the acculturation concept is that the content of the conveyed culture is not disclosed nor are the outcomes hinted at  we argue that the concept of norm images redresses these criticisms by eliciting the cultural content and specifying the role of actors  that is  professionals  in the conveyance of culture  using the example of the amsterdam police force  we demonstrate that police officers impose crucial elements of the dutch nationalistic discourse  specifically language and loyalty  on migrant citizens and migrant colleagues alike  thus these police officers operate as reproducers of the social order cemented by dutch nationalism  
 political memoirs and intimate confessions  analysing four us gay liberation gay rights militants  memoirs the us gay liberation and gay rights movements of the 1960s and 1970s are a contested historical and sociological terrain  we analyse the narrative reconstruction of militant identities in the memoirs of four gay movement militants   martin duberman  amy hoffman  karla jay  arnie kantrowitz  the article focuses on the way authors account for the interplay between their self discovery through sexuality and through militancy  we endeavour to fully appreciate the interaction of the personal and the social in order to gauge the degree to which confessions about sexuality take on a meaning that escapes authors  control  or whether that meaning is a reflection of the authors  agency  after a brief summary of how the authors tell about their sexual history  the article analyses the four authors  distinctly different genders  generations  and political options as pertinent variables for comparison among the memoirs  
 political tolerance and religion  an age period cohort analysis  1984 2014 using data from the 1984 2014 general social survey  we employ cross classified random effects models to examine age period cohort changes in political tolerance by religion  incorporating religious belief  belonging  and behavior into the analyses  the results show large cohort and period based changes in political tolerance of the various religious traditions  the results also suggest that the primary driver of changes over time in political tolerance is best attributed to period effects  not cohort replacement  although there is some evidence of a cohort effect among roman catholics  finally  our results demonstrate that aggregate data analyses can lead to noticeably different results and thus can mask substantial differences between groups  
 popular hazards and policy rhetoric popular hazards are common activities that involve some risks of harm  such as driving a car  possessing or shooting a gun  drinking alcohol  or smoking marijuana  in each of these cases  many millions of americans engage in the activity  but only a small fraction of them harm themselves or other people  because the activity is so common  the number harmed may be substantial  although more serious harms tend to be much more infrequent than less serious harms  social policy debates almost always focus on some particular popular hazard  yet we can see rhetorical similarities parallel arguments in how advocates frame what are understood to be very different social issues  thus  discourse about legalizing recreational marijuana use tends to invoke claims that are quite similar to those opposing further gun control  the category of popular hazards allows us to recognize parallels in policy debates about seemingly unrelated social issues  focusing on the underlying policy issue balancing popularity and hazardousness encourages considering alternative ways to construct social policies  
 portraying poverty  the economics and ethics of factual welfare television since 2013 there has been an explosion of a new genre of factual programming on british television that centres on the everyday lives of people claiming benefits  the emergence of factual welfare television  fwt  has coincided with intensifying public and political debates about poverty and the british welfare state  and has proved a deeply controversial and contested genre  while programme makers have argued that fwt fulfils a public service mandate to inform audiences  critics have accused producers of making inaccurate  provocative and unethical television  sociological enquiries into fwt have focused on the representations within these programmes and audience reception  arguing that these contribute to hardening anti welfare sentiment  this article presents a complementary and urgent line of enquiry into fwt  locating it squarely within the conditions of its production by including questions of cultural labour  diversity in the workforce  and increasing competition and deregulation within broadcasting  we argue that market logics governing broadcasting discipline cultural workers and contribute to the production of reductive and stigmatising representations of social class and poverty  in doing so  we offer new insights into relationships between television production  representation and   consequently   consumption  
 positive emotions and spirituality in older travelers this paper explores the potential of travel to generate self transcendent positive emotions and contribute to the spirituality of travelers  senior travelers are chosen as the target group for this research as spirituality and focus on emotions are salient characteristics of older adults  sixteen depth interviews are conducted with experienced travelers aged 60 85  content analysis reveals that travelling generates three categories of self transcendent positive emotions including awe of natural beauty and man s harmonious relationship with nature  awe of manmade heritage and artistic beauty  admiration of other people and appreciation of kindness  respondents also describe how travelling positively influences their spirituality by giving a positive meaning to their lives and nurturing their reflection on the meaning of life   c  2017 elsevier ltd  all rights reserved  
 post authoritarian state formation in argentina  transitional justice as the accumulation of symbolic power looking at the transitions to democracy in latin america during the late 20 th  century  a number of scholars observed that human rights and transitional justice had become the central legitimizing axis of the new  post authoritarian order  but the question of how human rights and transitional justice measures became such powerful sources of legitimacy in the first place was left unexplored  in this article i use bourdieu s concept of symbolic capital along with mara loveman s explanation of the accumulation of this capital to explain how transitional justice came to function as a form of post authoritarian state formation in argentina  
 power relations in employment disputes this article reconceptualizes the operation of power relations in employment disputes  we draw on foucault s theory of neo liberal governance to inform our analysis of empirical data exploring how low income workers make decisions about whether to engage with the employment tribunal system  particular focus is placed on the ways the state governs employment disputes to achieve ideologically driven objectives  we conclude  first  that power relations in employment disputes operate across a range of institutions and individuals  and that the state s role is powerful and ongoing  secondly  that power relations operate to shape not just the objective context that workers find themselves in when experiencing an employment dispute but also workers  subjective moral codes about appropriate courses of action to take  and thirdly  that despite the powerful influence of the state  workers continue to hold non economic values that guide their perception of the appropriate basis for relations between employers and workers  
 precarious workers and collective efficacy scholars of contemporary capitalism have argued that the rise of flexible accumulation and precarious employment has left workers disillusioned and adrift  experiencing an erosion of solidarities and human bonds  in contrast  this study uncovers a sense of collective efficacy where existing scholarship would lead us to least expect it  among workers who are  structurally  among the most marginal and vulnerable  the case examined is a chicago living wage campaign  which for three long years mobilized workers laboring outside of traditional employment relationships  why would a sense of collective efficacy emerge when participants  ability to make change had remained in doubt for years  why would workers who lack structural power come to feel so efficacious  drawing on in depth interviews with campaign participants  i argue that their understandings of power arose from their experience of collective action  the case sheds new light on our understanding of identity and subjectivity under contemporary capitalism  
 premarital cohabitation and marital dissolution in postreform china the author uses cohabitation data from the 2010 chinese family panel studies to analyze the association of premarital cohabitation with subsequent divorce of first marriage  after balancing selection factors that influence premarital cohabitation through propensity score matching  the author uses cox proportional hazards models to examine the selection  causation  and diffusion perspectives on the relationship between premarital cohabitation and marital dissolution  the results show that premarital cohabitation is positively associated with divorce for those married in the early reform period  1980 1994  when cohabitation was uncommon  however  this relationship disappears for those married in the late reform period  1995 2010  when cohabitation became more prevalent  the findings suggest variation in the link between premarital cohabitation and divorce across different marriage cohorts and provide strong evidence for the diffusion perspective in postreform china  supplemental sensitivity analyses support the robustness of the conclusion  
 pressured into a preference to leave  a study on the  specific  deterrent effects and perceived legitimacy of immigration detention immigration detention is formally not a punishment  but governments do use it to deter illegal residence  this study examines whether and how immigration detention affects detainees  decision making processes regarding departure  thereby possibly resulting in de facto specific deterrence  semistructured face to face interviews were conducted in the netherlands with 81 immigration detainees  and their case files were examined  evidence is found for a limited  selective deterrence effect at the level of detainee s attitudes  most respondents considered immigration detention a painful and distressing experience  but only a minoritymostly labor migrants without family ties in the netherlandsdeveloped a preference to return to their country of citizenship in hopes of ending their exposure  including repeated exposure  to the detention  in line with defiance theory  we find that eventual deterrent effects mostly occurred among detainees who also attributed some measure of legitimacy to their detention  among some detainees  the detention experience resulted in a preference to migrate to a neighboring european country  
 producing space  cultivating community  the story of praguea   s new community gardens this paper aims to fill the gap in literature concerning community gardens in post communist countries by focusing on the situation in prague  czechia  it introduces prague s newly emerged community gardens and presents the results of a first representative survey of these gardens  information was gathered about eleven of the sixteen larger community gardens and the data were collected by semi structured interviews with the managers of the particular gardens  the paper compares the czech community gardens as representatives of civic agriculture forms in post communist countries with their counterparts  mainly those in the north america  and stresses their similarities and differences  the results show that the new community gardens reflect much of what can be seen elsewhere in terms of spatial and organizational design  as well as reasons for starting them  motivations for participation and some of the challenges experienced  however  in contrast to many community gardens in the usa  canada and uk that focus on food and nutrition provision  in prague the community is more of a priority than food and the other mentioned benefits  the paper shows that different activities  events and functions make gardens important hubs of their communities and potential tools of further community involvement and social change  
 producing the product  a case study of law and its absence in this article  we seek to develop socio legal studies through a rupturing of the ideas behind the social and the legal  ideas that are most often presumed to exist and are used to explain that which is already there  the ubiquity of law and the omniscience of society have become givens  we use a product called shared ownership as a case study  arguing that the product was given life by a legal document  the lease  which itself represented the translation of a range of different perspectives and audiences  albeit not the consumer   and which  itself  has been translated  most notably in a 2008 high court decision  that decision counterintuitively found that the lease had created an assured shorthold tenancy  albeit a long one  but  despite its threat to the product  has been largely ignored  we discuss the processes of  and reasons for  the translation through which that ignorance has been induced  
 promoting dialogue between history and socio legal studies  the contribution of christopher w  brooks and the  legal turn  in early modern english history although history  legal history  and socio legal studies significantly overlap in concerns  methods  values and history  and a common tradition  these commonalities are frequently overlooked  in seeking to promote greater dialogue between these disciplines  this article examines their complex interaction  arguing that the work of socio legal scholars  historians  and legal historians would benefit from greater cross fertilization  it focuses on the legal turn  in recent history writing on early modern england  particularly christopher w  brooks s ground breaking analysis of the nature and extent of legal consciousness throughout society  and the central role of law and legal institutions in the constitution of society  it then outlines some areas of common interest and  having highlighted the increasing convergence between history  legal history  and socio legal studies  concludes that greater dialogue would enhance our understanding of the role of law in society  and of society  and would be of more than mere historical interest  
 promoting sustainable hotel guest behavior  a systematic review and meta analysis unsustainable patterns of tourist behavior produce a massive environmental burden  nevertheless  it is unknown which behavioral strategies can be implemented to foster resource efficient behavior in customers of leisure and travel services  this article aims to identify and summarize the evidence about the interventions which have been tested to promote sustainable hotel guest behavior  electronic searches were performed in the main databases from inception to september 2016  papers deemed eligible for inclusion were experimental field studies  reporting factual changes in guest behavior  the final sample was composed of nine papers comprising 13 studies in a total of 5 859 hotel stays  results showed that all included interventions targeted towel reuse  five different types of interventions were identified including environmental appeals  messages prompting commitment for conservation  donation to charity  social norms  and nudges  only the last two forms of interventions  social norms  effect size  es     0 25  95  confidence interval  ci      0 39   0 12   p    004 and nudges  es    0 43  95  ci     0 72   0 13   p    009  showed significant positive effects in promoting towel reuse  particularly regarding social norms  our work shows an effect weaker than reported in previous meta analyses but consistent  low between study heterogeneity  in producing modest increases in the levels of towel reuse  
 prospect theory and civil military conflict  the case of the 1976 korean axe murder incident this article investigates the potential use of prospect theory to understand civil military disputes over the use of force  specifically  i argue that distinct realms of responsibility can lead civilian and military authorities to inhabit different frames of reference when confronting the same crisis  this divergence in perspective causes each to asses risk in fundamentally disparate ways and ultimately produces competing policy recommendations  to illustrate this theory  i analyze the case of the 1976 korean tree cutting incident  during this crisis  american military authorities define the situation narrowly as pertaining to the korean peninsula  whereas the civilian leadership viewed it as part of a global challenge to american resolve  as a result  each party weighed the risks of escalation differently and promoted conflicting policy prescriptions  
 prosperity enhancing institutions  towards a comprehensive composite index institutions that potentially have a positive impact on economic performance rarely exist outside of a system of institutions  rather they are embedded in the institutional order of a country  it is thus imperative to investigate the composition of such prosperity enhancing institutional orders  this paper proposes a measurement of bundles of institutions that channel the positive effect of democratic institutions on economic prosperity  we construct composite sub indices measuring the political  economic and societal institutional quality as well as an overall index combining these bundles of institutions  index data is available for 148 countries between 1995 and 2010  we obtain scores summarizing the level of prosperity enhancing institutions that the respective countries exhibit with regard to their overall institutional setting and to the three bundles of institutions  and we grade the countries accordingly  since the indices allow for inter temporal comparisons  we can highlight a country s achievements in institutional development  amongst other aspects of country comparisons  and we show their value as a tool in the analysis of determinants of economic prosperity  the proposed indices are a step towards a more systematic international comparison of democratic institutional settings  
 protective or harmful  exploring the ambivalent role of social identification as a moderator of intergroup stress in sojourners living outside one s home country may be stressful  and having strong social ties should help deal with this stress  however  social ties may be protective or harmful depending on whether the social group they evoke belongs to the host  or the home country context  the current study examines how social identification with different groups may either buffer or aggravate the negative effects of two stressors  perceived discrimination and symbolic threat  on sojourner adaptation  two hundred and twenty international students sojourning in nine different countries responded to an online questionnaire  as expected  adaptation was negatively predicted by both stressors  moreover  high identification with the group of international students attenuated the negative effects of perceived discrimination on psychological adaptation  while home country identification aggravated the negative effects of symbolic threat on sociocultural adaptation  
 psychosocial outcomes in home based cardiovascular rehabilitation programmes exercise based cardiac rehabilitation has been introduced in medical practice many years ago  initially only as center based rehabilitation  it is part of the activities for the secondary prevention of cardiovascular diseases and has been effective in reducing cardiovascular morbidity and mortality  cardiac rehabilitation programs are commonly used in patients who have had an ischemic event or a myocardial revascularization procedure and in patients with heart failure of various etiologies  however  participation rate in center based rehabilitation programs is low  especially by the elderly or women  and depending on the variability of the symptoms of cardiovascular disease  alternative models are mainly based on telerehabilitation techniques and are grouped under the name of home based rehabilitation  our study aimed at reviewing the main randomized clinical trials published from january 2012 to december 2016  selected from the medline  web of science and science direct databases that compared home based with center based rehabilitation or usual care  and were focused on psychosocial outcomes  in the studied articles  the mental and social components were assessed by completing upon enrollment and at various times during reassessment quality of life questionnaires  questionnaires for depression and anxiety and self perceived stress  several studies highlight the superiority of home based rehabilitation in hemodynamically stable patients who wanted to resume their social and professional activities  the outcomes are generally similar in terms of increasing exercise capacity and superior in terms of quality of life  reducing anxiety and depression  or socio professional reintegration  
 public expenditure preferences in spain  self interest or values  this article analyses the factors that condition the public expenditure preferences of citizens in spain  it focuses on the role that individuals  economic motivations  ideology and values play in forming these preferences  two theories were selected for this purpose  self interest theory and symbolic predispositions  an empirical analysis showed that demographic and economic characteristics such as citizens  ideology and values influence how specific demands for public spending are articulated  in addition  the best predictors of the preferences in each public spending programmes are identified  the conclusion is that the impact of self interest and symbolic predispositions varies significantly depending on the nature of the different public policies  
 purpose and perceptions of family social location among rural youth purpose is a concept receiving increasing attention in the developmental sciences  making sense of your place in the world and finding meaninga process fundamental to purposesupport positive development in adolescence and beyond  using traditional ethnographic strategies  this article examines the development of purpose among a small group of youth growing up in wallowa county  oregon  specifically  we emphasize the differing ways that young people from high  average  and low purpose groups make sense of themselves and their experiences within the context of rural life  we find that how young people make sense of their family s social location has critical implications for purpose development  
 purposeful sampling in international comparative mixed methods research an example for the analysis of norms and practices of the household division of labour the paper motivates a mixed design for investigating the gender division of labour at the life course transition to parenthood and describes how the design has been realised  the focus is on the sampling strategy which aims to combine two longitudinal methods  each method is applied in international comparative perspective  the sampling is crucial  for both facilitating the comparison and integrating the research findings  the complementary research design aims at systematically linking social structure to the re production of gendered divisions of labour and its subjective meanings for dual earner parents  context related analysis of qualitative interviews in an explicit comparative design  combined with an analysis of structural patterns of action shows that the agency of expectant parents rises with congruence of dominant gender ideologies and family policies  
 putting ourselves in another s skin  using the plasticity of self perception to enhance empathy and decrease prejudice the self is one the most important concepts in social cognition and plays a crucial role in determining questions such as which social groups we view ourselves as belonging to and how we relate to others  in the past decade  the self has also become an important topic within cognitive neuroscience with an explosion in the number of studies seeking to understand how different aspects of the self are represented within the brain  in this paper  we first outline the recent research on the neurocognitive basis of the self and highlight a key distinction between two forms of self representation  the first is the  bodily  self  which is thought to be the basis of subjective experience and is grounded in the processing of sensorimotor signals  the second is the  conceptual  self  which develops through our interactions of other and is formed of a rich network of associative and semantic information  we then investigate how both the bodily and conceptual self are related to social cognition with an emphasis on how self representations are involved in the processing and creation of prejudice  we then highlight new research demonstrating that the bodily and conceptual self are both malleable and that this malleability can be harnessed in order to achieve a reduction in social prejudice  in particular  we will outline strong evidence that modulating people s perceptions of the bodily self can lead to changes in attitudes at the conceptual level  we will highlight a series of studies demonstrating that social attitudes towards various social out groups  e g  racial groups  can lead to a reduction in prejudice towards that group  finally  we seek to place these findings in a broader social context by considering how innovations in virtual reality technology can allow experiences of taking on another s identity are likely to become both more commonplace and more convincing in the future and the various opportunities and risks associated with using such technology to reduce prejudice  
 putting the world in orders  plurality in organizational evaluation sociologists have shown that external evaluation stimulates convergent organizational behavior  yet many evaluative practices are superficial or susceptible to manipulation  when does external evaluation lead to convergence in organizational fields  organizations regularly and increasingly experience fragmented social orders based on orthogonal notions of value  or so called plurality  i propose that the plurality of evaluative landscapes  that is  the universe of rankings  ratings  and awards in an organizational field  compromises the potential homogenizing influence of any single evaluative practice  plurality in the evaluative landscape weakens the causal channels through which evaluative practices influence organizational behavior  because evaluative activities are responsive to social conditions  plurality is suggested to be highest when organizations face multiple audiences  when the meaning of value is contested  and when access to evaluation is unregulated  neoinstitutional organizational theory and the sociology of valuation  both of which inform this article  would benefit from a more integrated account of evaluative landscapes  
 puzzling evidence on voter turnout in this empirical analysis of voting patterns in five countries on days when one or more national referenda were held  voter turnout appears to decline in the number of concurrent referenda  in contrast to standard theories  predictions and regardless of method used to hold constant the quality of the referenda  multiple concurrent referenda imply quantity discounts  as one may vote on more ballots in one visit to the polling station  they should also draw more voters due to the wider range of interests attracted when more issues are up for vote  yet  none of this seems to happen in the data  more recent developments  such as rule utilitarian and information based theories of voting  fare similarly poorly in light of the evidence presented in this article  a social theory of voting does better  
 quadrilateral relationship between information and communications technology  patent applications  research and development expenditures  and growth factors  evidence from the group of seven  g 7  countries the quadrilateral relationship between information and communications technology  ict   patent applications  research and development expenditures and specific growth factors examine to formulate the broad based growth policies in the context of group of seven  g 7  countries  over the period of 1995 2013  the ict variables are explained by internet users  mobile cellular subscriptions and high technology exports  while research and development  r d  variables include r d expenditures and researchers in r d  patent data is used to evaluate the amount of innovation undertaken in the g 7 countries and it comprises residential patent applicants and non residential patent applicants  finally  the study used three growth factors including gdp per capita  foreign direct investment  fdi  inflows and gdp per unit use of energy for appraising the growth reforms in the g 7 countries  the results show that there is a significant and positive relationship between high technology exports and growth factors  while there is a negative relationship between residential patent applicants and per capita gdp  and fdi inflows   non residential patent applicants  increases gdp per capita while it decreases energy efficiency  residential patent applicants  significantly increases energy efficiency in the region  there is a negative relationship between r d expenditures and gdp per capita  and energy efficiency   while researchers involved in r d activities significantly enlarge the per capita gdp and energy efficiency in the g 7 countries  the results of variance decomposition analysis confirmed the importance of ict over the next 10 years period  the study concludes that r d expenditures and innovation required strong policy vista in order to amplify the growth factors in the region  
 quality of life and social justice in romania  measuring quality of life starting from the main components dimensions of the quality of life  the paper aims an analysis the role and the place of social indicators  objective and subjective ones  in achieving life satisfaction of the romanian population during transition  thus  the study focuses on the main factors with a decisive impact on the quality of life  the national economy  social state  community  and individuals  performance in romania compared with the european standards  the paper underlines that despite the fact that within both national and european official statistics the range of  objective  indicators for the quality of life are at the forefront of attention  see living standard  income  employment  etc    the specific proper indicators for the quality of life are the subjective ones  in fact  quality of life involves par excellence an evaluative structure  first  it supposes a set of indicators of state which record the actual characteristics at a given moment for all life dimensions  and second  a set of evaluation criteria in relation to which we may assess this state  from this perspective  the paper analyses some recent researches and statistical data of the national and international surveys related to individual general satisfaction with life  it is estimated based on subjective indicators regarding the overall positive experience life has as outcome  and the perceived quality of the basic components of life  in addition  the paper focuses on social policies in the period of romanian transition with the great impact in life satisfaction  from this point of view  the evaluation process of social inclusion of vulnerable groups in post communist romania is relation with the main indicators of social justice  therefore  as a conclusion  an analysis of the real state of the quality of life must take into account next to objective indicators of state  essential for the living conditions  also the subjective ones  in fact  they capture the reaction perception of the population about the given socio economic context  the subjective well being   subjective indicators emerge much more frequently in academic research analyses  sometimes  as a rule  researches focused to happiness as an individual general satisfaction with life indicator  the human condition emerges thus as basic milestone and dimension for the quality of life

 quantifying transformation of qualitative data in quantitative data in mixed methods studies the challenge in data analysis often lies in taking account of the multi dimensionality and complexity of the data and at the same time discovering patterns  which requires reduction and simplification  quantitizing qualitative data can serve as an additional step during data analysis to broaden the perspective and collect complementary views  examples from research illustrate how information gathered during one data collection can generate different types of data or how qualitative data can be transformed to be analysed statistically  practicalities of integrating qualitative and quantitative analyses are illustrated to offer good practice examples for transformation designs  qual    quan   with the methodological reflection of research practice i evaluate consequences for the field of mixed methods research  in which the statistical analysis of codes created during an interpretive phase plays a minor role  
 race and determinations of discrimination  vigilance  cynicism  skepticism  and attitudes about legal mobilization in employment civil rights what factors affect whether ordinary citizens believe that workplace decisions involving african american employees rise to the level of discrimination  when do observers believe targets of possible race discrimination should consider mobilizing the law  we use a factorial design vignette study administered to a nationally representative sample of 2 087 ordinary people to address these questions  the vigilance hypothesis predicts that minorities will be more likely to perceive discrimination than whites  our analysis partially confirms this  african americans perceive anti black discrimination at higher rates than do whites and latinos  while latinos do not show a significant difference from whites  where respondents believe discrimination occurred  we analyze what influences whether respondents might recommend legal mobilization  the cynicism hypothesis suggests that people of color may be less likely to favor using law  we find  however  that african american and latino respondents express more confidence in civil litigation  compared to whites  further  african americans express the strongest support for legal mobilization  recommending that a friend contact an attorney   while whites and latinos do not differ in mobilization recommendations  
 race in an epigenetic time  thinking biology in the plural the notion that biological memories of environmental experiences can be embedded in the human genome and even transmitted transgenerationally is increasingly relevant in the postgenomic world  particularly in molecular epigenetics  where the genome is conceptualized as porous to environmental signals  in this article i discuss the current rethinking of race in epigenetic rather than genetic terms  emphasizing some of its paradoxical implications  especially for public policy  i claim in particular that   i  if sociologists want to investigate race in a postgenomic world they should pay more attention to this novel plastic and biosocial view of race  and  ii  there are no reasons to believe that an epigenetic view will extinguish race  or that soft inheritance claims will produce a less exclusionary discourse than genetics  hard heredity   quite the opposite  the ground for a re racialization of social debates and the reinforcement of biological boundaries between groups are highlighted in the article  
 race  online space and the feminine  unmapping  black girl thinspiration  a major component of the online pro eating disorder culture   pro ana  and  pro mia   is what is referred to as  thinspiration  or  thinspo   which consists of images  slogans and videos aimed at inspiring the pursuit of extreme thinness  more recently  there is a specific kind of thinspiration  labeled online as  black girl thinspiration   that seeks to inspire black women to reject fuller figured body shapes as beautiful and responsible  through the application of a spatial analysis  i contend that pro eating disorder environments are spaces where women attempt to de mark their racialized bodies through hard work  will power and mastery over their desires  theorizing from critical race and feminist postmodern perspectives  this article disrupts the white hegemony and privilege of the thin ideal  this disruption is achieved through unmapping how modern capitalism  sexism  and racism operate in unison to produce women who starve  purge  abuse laxatives and hate their bodies  while highlighting the tremendous violence embedded in these practices  
 racial identity and the quality of life among blacks and whites in the us social identity theory and research on mental health among racial minority groups suggest that a stronger  more positive racial identity will be related to a higher subjective quality of life  we investigate how ingroup closeness  ingroup evaluation  and ingroup bias are associated with happiness  positive affect about life  and generalized trust for blacks and whites  using partial proportional odds models  data came from the 1996 2014 general social surveys  n   6553   ingroup closeness and more favorable ingroup evaluation had mostly positive associations with the quality of life dimensions  contrary to what social identity theory would predict  ingroup bias was either unrelated or negatively related to them  racial identity functions somewhat differently for blacks and whites  ingroup evaluation and ingroup bias were related to greater positive affect about life for blacks but lower positive affect about life for whites   c  2017 elsevier inc  all rights reserved  
 racial ethnic patterns of kindergarten school enrollment in the united states enrollment into unequal schools at the start of formal education is an important mechanism for the reproduction of racial ethnic educational inequalities  we examine whether there are racial ethnic differences in school enrollment options at kindergarten  the start of schooling  we use nationally representative data from the early childhood longitudinal study birth cohort  ecls b  to model whether parents seek information about their child s school before enrolling  whether parents move to a location so that a child can attend a certain school  or whether parents enroll their child in a school other than the assigned public school  results indicate that enrollment patterns differ greatly across race ethnicity  whereas black families are the most likely to seek information on a school s performance  white families are the most likely to use the elite option of choosing their residential location to access a particular school  these differences persist when controlling for socioeconomic status and sociogeographic location  kindergarten enrollment patterns preserve the advantages of white families  perpetuating racial ethnic disparities through multiple institutions and contributing to intergenerational processes of social stratification  research should continue to examine specific educational consequences of housing inequities and residential segregation  
 racism in trump s america  reflections on culture  sociology  and the 2016 us presidential election despite much positive change in the post civil rights era  u s  notions of racism and white supremacy remain powerful elements of american culture  the adaptability and enduring power of these forces can be seen in the emergence of a new historical epoch best describe as the era of laissez faire racism  prevalent attitudes among white americans  certain theoretical arguments and hypotheses in american sociology  as well the election of donald trump rest upon the on going operation of racism  in particular  i attribute trump s electoral success to three critical dilemmas of race that defined contours of the 2016 presidential election   1  worsening economic inequality in the presence of rapidly changing ethno racial demography   2  intensified political partisanship in the presence of well institutionalized racially coded campaign strategies and rhetoric  and  3  the failure of the clinton campaign to simultaneously champion the interests of working and middle class families and galvanize the previously powerful multiracial obama coalition  i speculate on how to forge more effective multiracial coalitions in the future  
 racism without hatred  racist humor and the myth of  colorblindness  critical race scholars contend that the current period of  race relations  is dominated by a  color blind  racial ideology  scholars maintain that although individuals continue to hold conventional racial views  today people tend to minimize overt racial discourse and direct racial language in public to avoid the stigma of racism  this essay identifies racist humor as a discourse that challenges such constraints on public racist discourse  often derided as  political correctness   in ways that reinforce everyday and systemic forms of racism in an ostensibly color blind society  while humor research generally highlights the  positive  aspects of social humor and celebrates the possibilities of humor to challenge and subvert dominant racial meanings  the  negative  aspects of racist humor are often overlooked  downplayed  or are viewed as extreme and fringe incidents that occur at the periphery of mainstream society  moreover  race scholars have largely ignored the role of humor as a  serious  site for the reproduction and circulation of racism in society  i contend that in a post civil rights and color blind society  where overt racist discourse became disavowed in public  racist humor allows interlocutors to foster social relations by partaking in the  forbidden fruit  of racist discourse  in this article  i highlight the  re circulation of racist jokes across three social contexts  in mass market joke books  on the internet  and in the criminal justice system   to illustrate that racist humor exists not in a bygone past or at the margins of society but is widely practiced and circulated today across various social contexts and institutions in an ostensibly color blind society  
 radius of trust  gradient based conceptualization and measurement the radius of trust   the width of one s cooperation circle   has been widely cited by scholars from various disciplines as a key factor in the production and maintenance of public good  however  the vagueness in its conceptualization  measurement  and analysis obstructs efficient communication between empirical works  impeding the accumulation of scientific knowledge  this study develops a conceptualization of trust radius as the gradient in the level of trust in specific individuals across social ties of differing strengths  along with this conceptualization  a new measurement scheme is constructed  which  relative to previous measures  is empirically easy to implement and theoretically valid in displaying individual level variations in trust radius  highlighting trust radius  distinction from generalized trust and affinity with specific trust  and accommodating the differing tie strengths within one s trust network  finally  this measurement scheme is well integrated in a multilevel modeling framework to study the determinants of trust radius  which is illustrated by two examples   c  2017 elsevier inc  all rights reserved  
 randomized sequential individual assignment in social experiments  evaluating the design options prospectively many randomized experiments in the social sciences allocate subjects to treatment arms at the time the subjects enroll  desirable features of the mechanism used to assign subjects to treatment arms are often  1  equal numbers of subjects in intervention and control arms   2  balanced allocation for population subgroups and across covariates   3  ease of use  and  4  inability for a site worker to predict the treatment arm for a subject before he or she has been assigned  in general  a trade off must be made among these features  many mechanisms that achieve high balance do so at the cost of high predictability  in this article  we review methods for randomized assignment of individuals that have been discussed in the literature  evaluating the performance of each with respect to the desirable design features  we propose a method for controlling the amount of predictability in a study while achieving high balance across subgroups and covariates  the method is applicable when a database containing the subgroup membership and covariates of each potential participant is available in advance  we use simple simulation and graphical methods to evaluate the balance and predictability of randomization mechanisms when planning the study and describe a computer program implemented in the r statistical software package that prospectively evaluates candidate randomization methods  
 rangeland fire protection associations in great basin rangelands  a model for adaptive community relationships with wildfire  widespread concern with the negative impacts of wildfire on human communities has spurred calls to foster more resilient and adaptable forms of community coexistence with fire  however  numerous institutional barriers work to perpetuate maladaptive individual and collective behaviors in many communities  here we examine a unique institutional model in the remote u s  west in which rural community members play active roles in responding to wildland fire under state sanctioned rangeland fire protection associations  our findings drawn from case studies of four associations in idaho and oregon suggest that the rangeland fire protection association model presents opportunities to leverage the motivations  skills  and knowledge of ranchers to inform effective fire response and create opportunities for learning and adaptation  at the same time  this model of coproduction presents challenges to the integration of formal and informal institutions  
 rank optimal weighting or  how to be best in the oecd better life index   we present a method of rank optimal weighting which can be used to explore the best possible position of a subject in a ranking based on a composite indicator by means of a mathematical optimization problem  as an example  we explore the dataset of the oecd better life index and compute for each country a weight vector which brings it as far up in the ranking as possible with the greatest advance of the immediate rivals  the method is able to answer the question  what is the best possible rank a country can achieve with a given set of weighted indicators   typically  weights in composite indicators are justified normatively and not empirically  our approach helps to give bounds on what is achievable by such normative judgments from a purely output oriented and strongly competitive perspective  the method can serve as a basis for exact bounds in sensitivity analysis focused on ranking positions  in the oecd better life index data we find that 19 out the 36 countries in the oecd better life index 2014 can be brought to the top of the ranking by specific weights  we give a table of weights for each country which brings it to its highest possible position  many countries achieve their best rank by focusing on their strong dimensions and setting the weights of many others to zero  although setting dimensions to zero is possible in the oecd s online tool  this contradicts the idea of better life being multidimensional in essence  we discuss modifications of the optimization problem which could take this into account  e g  by allowing only a minimal weight of one  methods to find rank optimal weights can be useful for various multidimensional datasets like the ones used to rank universities or employers  
 ratio via machina  three standards of mechanistic explanation in sociology recently  sociologists have expended much effort in attempts to define social mechanisms  we intervene in these debates by proposing that sociologists in fact have a choice to make between three standards of what constitutes a good mechanistic explanation  substantial  formal  and metaphorical mechanistic explanation  all three standards are active in the field  and we suggest that a more complete theory of mechanistic explanation in sociology must parse these three approaches to draw out the implicit evaluative criteria appropriate to each  doing so will reveal quite different preferences for explanatory scope and nuance hidden under the ubiquitous term social mechanism  finally  moving beyond extensive debates about realism and antirealism  we argue prescriptively against mechanistic fundamentalism for sociology and advocate for a more pluralistic understanding of social causality  
 re conceptualizing gaps by socioeconomic status in parental time with children differences in the total time that parents spend with their children by socioeconomic status  ses  are well documented  however  the qualitative aspects of such gaps are potentially important  yet relatively understudied  the current study analyzes time use data for a nationally representative sample of married households with at least two children  one of whom is under 13  n   21 016   from the american time use survey to provide a more nuanced analysis of previously documented differences in the time parents spend with children by ses  specifically  two understudied aspects of family time are considered  both of which are distinct from other types of parent child time and are potentially particularly developmentally beneficial  shared time when both parents are present with a child and individual child time when no siblings are present  we find that shared time when both parents are simultaneously present with a child often comprises a substantial portion of the total gap in parental time spent with children between college educated parents and parents who did not complete high school  similarly  college educated parents spend more time with children in the absence of the child s siblings than do less educated parents  gaps in this time classification are often found within enriching time  which is likely especially developmentally beneficial  potentially amplifying the effects of these gaps on child development  generally  these results suggest that gaps in parental time with children by ses are more nuanced than previous research has recognized  
 re immersing into elite swimming culture  a meta autoethnography by a former elite swimmer this paper presents two meta autoethnographies written by a former elite swimmer  in the first meta autoethnography  the swimmer revealed doubts in relation to details  emotions and inner thoughts that she had included in her historical autoethnographic work  as a means of sorting and pondering these tensions and uncertainties  the swimmer explored cultural re immersion as a possible additional element in the meta autoethnographic process  the second meta autoethnography centers on the swimmer s re immersion into elite swimming culture  it was revealed how cultural re immersion enabled the swimmer to better reflect on her historical autoethnographic work by providing a more conscientized  rational and reflexive voice  this research highlights how cultural re immersion should be considered as an additional element in the meta autoethnographic process as it benefits both the author and also audience

 reading  race  in bourdieu  examining black cultural capital among black caribbean youth in south london this article extends bourdieu s notion of cultural capital in relation to race  and ethnicity by exploring the significance of black cultural capital among middle class black caribbean young people in a large state school in south london  black cultural capital is here defined as the appropriation of middle class values by black ethnics  based on a 14 month long ethnography  with specific attention to three focus group and 13 in depth interviews with middle class black caribbean young people  this piece outlines the benefits of and backlash to black cultural capital that students encounter from white middle class teachers for deploying black middle class tastes and styles in the classroom  the findings suggest that while black middle class pupils draw on black cultural capital to access advantages in formal school settings  they are also invested in challenging the terms of class privilege that marginalise the black working classes  
 rebel or rioter  luddites then and now the encyclopaedia britannica contains an entry under the heading  luddite  and has had such an entry for over 100 years  this essay employs standard discourse analysis techniques to identify changes in the way the luddites have been presented to the public by the encyclopaedia over the same period  it is argued that as the potential readership has broadened and deepened across class boundaries  so has the narrative shifted from autocratic towards populist and the luddites from rioting simpletons to rebel handicraftsmen  
 rebuilding indigenous nations through constitutional development  a case study of the metis in canada for the metis nation in canada  self government remains the essence of the struggle  for which their political leader  louis riel  sacrificed his life in 1885  as one of canada s founding peoples  the metis have sought to reclaim their indigenous right to self government by establishing democratic governance bodies  enhancing their economic capacity and pursuing state recognition of their rights  in addition to these efforts  the metis have been developing a national constitution  which is anticipated to form the basis of a government to government relationship between the metis nation and the canadian state  through a case study of the metis  this article explores the role of contemporary constitution building in rebuilding indigenous nations from within and reclaiming self government in settler societies  we conclude that the metis nation s pursuit of these goals through constitutionalism will depend on its ability to build legitimacy internally amongst its citizens and externally with state decision makers  
 recasting secular thinking for emancipatory feminist practice the renewed vitality of religion in political and public life has prompted reconsideration of established ideas about secularisation and secularism  in western europe  ethnocentric enforcements of secularism are implicated in oppressive practices directed at minority women and communities while religiously justified authoritarian movements against rights for women and lgbtq people continue to emerge  these postsecular  challenges require recasting secular thinking within a wider re theorisation of emancipatory feminist practice  this means recognising the positivity of religious subjectivities and norms in emancipatory political projects  it also entails rethinking the nature of the secular state and challenging oppressions emanating from enforced secularism no less than from coerced conformity to religious norms  the musawah framework for action advanced by the malaysian advocacy group sisters in islam is discussed to illustrate how secular thinking can be recast for emancipatory feminist practice to transform narrow eurocentric accounts of secularism and patriarchal interpretations of secular and religious norms  
 recruitment and retention in british army reserve logistics units the british army reserve  ar   and in particular its logistics component  is undergoing profound changes  the future reserves 2020 policy aims to expand the ar and make it more deployable on operations  however  to date  fr20 has struggled to attract the recruits required to man this more deployable reserve force  despite recruitment campaigns offering increased monetary benefits  this study sampled ar logistics soldiers  reasons for joining  remaining in service  and mobilizing when deployed  consistent with the previous research  the study found that soldiers who joined for institutional reasons were more associated with longer career intentions and mobilizing for intrinsic reasons  soldiers who joined for occupational reasons were less satisfied with all elements of reserve service and deployed in order to fulfill their contracts  these trends suggest that recruitment campaigns that stress the pecuniary benefits of reserve service may attract soldiers less committed to reserve service and deployments and who are harder to retain  
 redefining intersectionality theory through the lens of african american young adolescent girls  racialized experiences the research presented uses intersectionality theory as a lens to study the racial identity construction of four african american young adolescent girls  the findings suggest that race was largely situated in a black white discourse for the girls in the study  when limited information was provided in home  school  and community settings  the participants made meaning from dominant discourses about race and identity  although glimpses of critical thinking about race did occur  in conclusion  the potential of including youth identity within intersectionality theory to broaden the utility of the theory itself and also for making meaning of and advocating for marginalized adolescents is discussed  
 refinancing as an organizational problem it is evident that organizations face a fundamental need for money  be it in order to pay employees  to buy machines  or to rent offices  despite empirical evidence of its importance the problem of refinancing has been widely neglected by sociological theories of organizations  this article offers a heuristic that draws attention to the organizational need for money  to do so  section 2 examines the reasons why money has so far been widely disregarded in the sociology of organizations  in order to address the organizational need for money as a problem in its own right  section 3 conceptualizes money as a meta resource and distinguishes four modes of refinancing  section 4 shows what this approach can contribute to organizational research by applying the suggested conceptual framework to the analysis of non profit organizations  the final section draws conclusions about the future development of organizational theory  namely systems theory and new institutionalism  
 reframing sociologies of ethnicity and migration in encounters with chinese london in this paper i argue that the intersecting sociologies of ethnicity and migration work from a series of interconnected blind spots hindering effective analysis of the current uk situation  both operate analytically within the limitations of an immigrant problem  framework  are overinvested in state agendas  privilege a nation state analysis  are narrowly focused on distributions of migrant bodies  and on receiving  at the expense of sending  contexts  exploring these limitations with data derived from a modest small scale qualitative study of young chinese migrants in london  i argue for a reframing along four dimensions  firstly  in an era of elite migration  sociology could reach beyond its immigrant problem framework and open up to a broader range of uk migrant ethnicities and circumstances  secondly  a stronger focus on cities as the scale on which lives are lived  and through which diverse streams of translocal activity are routed  would open new avenues of sociological exploration  thirdly  including translocal activities connected with distributions of ethnic migrant bodies  such as capital transfers  would broaden its focus  taking migration and ethnicity more centrally into the analysis of globalization as one of its constituting practices  finally  paying attention to sending  as well as arrival cities  reveals migrants  thinking and shapes the ways in which they live  as my data shows  the chinese are both one of the uk s neglected minorities  and one of its fastest growing populations  they are a good example of new uk migrants and they bring globalization s realignment with the rising significance of china to the uk  
 regional differences in the gender wage gap in spain this study examines regional differences in the gender wage gap in spain using matched employer employee microdata  two different econometric decomposition methods and panel data techniques  our findings suggest that spain shows a significant regional heterogeneity in the size of the raw gap  roughly comparable to cross country differences observed in the european context  the results from the decomposition analysis show that although the bulk of the gender wage gap in spanish regions is due to differences in the endowments of productive characteristics between males and females there is still a substantial part of the gap that remains unexplained  the analysis of the causes behind the variation of both  the raw and the unexplained gender wage gap by region highlights that several economic  institutional and demographic elements identified in previous studies analysing international differences in the gender wage gap are also relevant to explain regional differences in the gender wage gap in spain  
 reimagining omnivorousness in the context of place place is a key driver in the formation and maintenance of cultural lifestyles  yet  place remains largely ignored in scholarly studies of cultural omnivorousness  after establishing whether there are different modes of omnivorousness as well as distinguishing between other cultural lifestyles  this article then takes a first step in readdressing this anomaly by examining whether clustering exists at the regional level in england  using a methodologically innovative approach to simultaneously capture latent class typologies and between group heterogeneity at the area scale  our findings illustrate how place is vital to consumption habits  particularly to voracious omnivores  we argue that the underlying mechanism behind these cultural patterns at the area level is contextual in nature  and in the case of voracious omnivores  primarily due to the supply of cultural items and the importance of likeminded individuals in active networks  
 relational resources of individuals living in couple  evidence from an italian survey the need for support becomes stronger in situations of pressure  uncertainty and overload caused by unfavorable economic  demographic or social circumstances  especially in countries such as italy where an adequate welfare system is lacking  the individual s social space can represent a resilience  anti frailty  tool through the activation of a support network  while the literature has mainly analyzed the support that some vulnerable categories  e g   elderly and youths  receive from their family  we focus on individuals living in italy in the first stages of their family life  with the aim of describing their support network  we construct the potential support ego centered  pse  network at partner and couple level of individuals living in couple using data from the survey  family and social subjects  carried out in italy in 2009 by the italian national statistical institute  furthermore  we compare the network typologies detected using two alternative clustering techniques with the objective of finding the partners  and couples  network types and verifying whether traditional strong support received by the family persists in italy and or whether new kinds of support networks are emerging  several pse network typologies  ranging from empty to comprehensive networks  were determined with a fair match between the two procedures  analysis revealed the importance of friends and neighbors  especially in the north of italy  to the support of partners and couple as a whole  
 relations of difference  power and inequality in intersectional and postcolonial feminist theories feminist theory has addressed relations of difference  heterogeneity  and hierarchy within gender groups as well as the entanglement of various forms of differentiation  power  and inequality for a long time  this does not mean that there was unanimity with regard to the best way of doing this  though  today  we can distinguish different approaches in this regard  and there is contestation about both the analytical and the political advantages and pitfalls of each of them  this article concentrates on two of these approaches  on the one hand on intersectional ones  which strongly focus on inequality  and on the other hand on postcolonial feminist theories  which put the emphasis on global power relations and interactions  the article discusses select positions of both intersectional and postcolonial feminist theories in conjunction  and argues why and how they should be conceptualized as complementary  
 relationships between children s behaviour and parents  work within families of mining and energy workers we examine the relationships between the working arrangements of mineworkers and behavioural issues in their children  using a large australian matched pair dataset of workers and their partners  the findings suggest both that workers  work conditions  and aspects of safety and security influence aspects of child behaviour  reflecting not least the results of tiredness  emotional exhaustion and sleep interruption  in addition  it appears that child behaviour probably influences the pressure experienced by their parents and hence their attitudes towards aspects of work  
 religion et politique  un aller retour entre appartenance et croyance  gauche radicale et un groupe de    femmes monastiques    en italie this article analyses the double conversion of a group of italian women  first to communism then to catholicism  offspring of the bourgeois catholic families of turin  these women became extreme left activists in the 1960s and 1970s  today they are active members in traditional catholic milieus  more specifically  they live close to a catholic monastery  carrying out services for the male community  the specific aim of the contribution is to understand whether and to what extent religion influenced the political choice  and vice versa   from a micro history perspective  the study focuses on the categories of believing  belonging and behaving in both the political and religious communities  
 religious belief in christian higher education  is religious and political diversity relativizing  while attending college  religious participation tends to decline among american students  but evidence of changes in religious belief is less clear  on the bases of both secularization theory and the moral communities thesis  we used multi level modeling techniques to test whether institutional diversity predicts changes in student belief at christian institutions  results suggest that declines in absolutism were associated with increasing religious and political diversity  and religious diversity amplified the effects of academic tenure  political diversity  however  explained the effects of religious diversity in combined models  suggesting that challenging political discourse may be more important for changes in religious belief than diversity of religious worldviews in the context of christian higher education in the united states  
 religious transformations and generalized trust in sub saharan africa prominent versions of social capital theory presume a positive link between voluntary memberships including religious memberships and generalized trust in society  yet this relationship has not been tested in sub saharan africa  a region with low average levels of generalized trust and high levels of religious membership and participation  where the rise of charismatic evangelical churches has recently transformed the religious landscape  contrary hypotheses based in a theory of oppositional subcultures would suggest that memberships in such churches could dampen generalized trust due to their oppositional discourse vis a vis the wider society  in this paper  i use 2008 afrobarometer survey data from seven countries in the region to test these contrasting hypotheses  analyzing both the pooled data and the separate country datasets  i find mixed evidence for the link between religious membership and generalized trust  and more consistent evidence that affiliating with a charismatic evangelical group is negatively associated with generalized trust  the study supports the conclusion that the link between religious membership and generalized trust is dependent on both the context and the content of the discourse circulating in religious settings  
 religiousness as tourist performances  a case study of greek orthodox pilgrimage the aim of this paper is to decipher ways of experiencing religiousness through tourist performances  intersecting textual approaches with the essential embodiment and materiality of the tourist world  exploring the diversity of religious tourists  practices within the greek orthodox context  two dimensions underpinning religious tourist experience are highlighted  institutional performances and unconventional performances  focussing on the embodied experience and drawing upon theories of performance  the paper critiques the interplays of body and place to re conceptualise current understanding of the pilgrimage tourism relationship  in doing so  the paper proposes that tourism and religion are not separate entities but linked through embodied notions of godliness sensed through touristic performances   c  2017 the authors  published by elsevier ltd  
 renegotiating social citizenship in the age of devolution the period 2012 to 2016 saw important developments in the role of the united kingdom s devolved legislatures in shaping the social rights of citizenship  near uniformity in social security is being eroded  with competences devolved to scotland and northern ireland proceeding with limited divergence from great britain  this turn to regionalism is linked with dissatisfaction with british government approaches  this article examines developments from a social citizenship perspective  welfare state regionalism is a challenge to marshall s perceived unitary view of citizenship  yet  it is argued  moves towards divergence are driven by regional differences of perspective on citizens  social rights and reciprocal obligations in a way that emphasizes the continued relevance of marshallian theory  the democratization of political rights gave birth to social rights in the early twentieth century  today  the regionalization of democratic citizenship enables alternative visions for social citizenship to be articulated and begin to shape welfare services at devolved level  
 representations of female sexuality in spanish television fiction the overrepresentation of sexual content on television and the debate raised by new femininities have transformed research on sexuality and tv fiction into a fruitful field of study  content analyses demonstrate that television fiction offers a distorted image of sexuality and that information on relevant sex issues is barely considered  this article analyzes the sexual representations of female characters in spanish tv fiction using a hybrid method that combines spss statistics tools and socio semiotics  the sample consists of 709 female characters from all the shows premiered in 2012 and 2013  the sexual activity of the female characters is related to physical attractiveness and age  with the exception of children and adolescents  young female characters in the sample identify empowerment with sexual assertiveness and control  while sexual depictions of women over 45 are almost non existent  sexual relations are presented as the  natural  outcome of romantic relationships and seduction  
 representations that underlay the inclusive educational policy in chile the implementation of chilean inclusive education policy has not been without discussion  structuring a differenced and open education system faced the stresses of uncertainty  in this context  based on a qualitative methodology  this study discusses the social representations of inclusive policy from 378 online comments posted by internet users of chilean news portals  content analysis was performed to identify the assessments and arguments supporting the representations of educational inclusion  the inability to counterargument in past virtual environments is identified as the main limitation for in depth information  two models of representations are identified  the first linked to a social reproduction orientation associated to learning disciplinary standards and assessment of institutional educational projects  while the second assessed the right to education prioritizing learning and respect for individuals  
 residential arrangements and children s school engagement  the role of the parent child relationship and selection mechanisms the increase in shared residential arrangements is driven by the belief that it is in the best interest of the child  the maintenance of contact between child and parents can mitigate negative consequences of separation  however  selection mechanisms may account for a positive relationship between shared residential arrangements and child outcomes  this study examines the association between children s residential arrangements and their school engagement  focusing on the parent child relationship as a mediator and selection mechanisms  structural equation models are performed on a sample of 973 secondary school pupils with separated parents from the leuven adolescents and families study  lafs  2008 2011   the results suggest that more parental time is related with a better parent child relationship  and this leads indirectly to higher school engagement  however  shared residence may also have negative consequences for children and is certainly not the only residential arrangement in which children have a good relationship with both parents  
 resistance and resignation  responses to typecasting in british acting this article draws on 38 in depth interviews with british actors to explore the operation of typecasting  first  we argue that typecasting acts as the key mechanism through which the somatic norm  is established in british acting  it delivers an oversupply of leading roles for white  male  middle class actors while ensuring that those who deviate somatically are restricted to largely socially caricatured roles  second  we focus on the career trajectories of othered  actors  while they frequently experience acting roles as offensive and discriminatory  we demonstrate how most nonetheless reluctantly accept the terms of their type  in order to survive and succeed  third  we focus on the minority who have attempted to challenge their type  here we find that successful resistance is accomplished by carefully choosing work that subverts the somatic norm  however  the ability to exercise such choice is highly contingent on resources associated with an actor s class origin  
 restorative practices and youth work  theorizing professional power relationships with young people restorative practices  rp  and youth work continue to emerge as more formalized fields of theory and practice  the interaction between these fields requires attention as rp gain popularity among services delivered to young people  of particular importance  and currently receiving inadequate attention  is a tension regarding the conceptualization of power in the relationship between practitioners and young people  this article examines the conceptualization of power within youth work and restorative practices drawing on post structural power knowledge relations  a shared emphasis on empowerment and relationality within these fields obscures the problematization of the young person worker dynamic  of concern in particular is that restorative practices appear to operate within a power knowledge discourse of control  this article will outline the frameworks  potential as a source of both transformation and extension of a carceral network   
 restrictionist discourse by the numbers  the framing of the demographic impacts of immigration this article examines the attempts by restrictionist groups to use the internet to construct demographic arguments and legitimize immigration as a social problem  i argue that demographic arguments serve two key and related functions for groups seeking more restrictive immigration policies  one  to legitimize their claims as scientific and objective  and two  to counter claims that their positions are nativist or racially based  my analyses suggest that while the numbers presented by these groups to construct immigration as a  demographic threat  appear objective  that these numbers are frequently biased and reliant on conceptions of  american  identity as white and anglo saxon  i also argue that the ability of these groups to link to and cite one another on the internet represents an important strategy in reinforcing and bolstering the legitimacy of their claims

 rethinking double jeopardy  differences in the gender disadvantage between organizational insiders and outsiders in korea this study examines the distinctive patterns of gender inequality in the primary and secondary labor markets in korea  previous studies that analyzed multiple disadvantages in the labor market tended to focus on comparing the gender wage gap between groups  by failing to distinguish the gender gap from discrimination  these studies often underestimate the severe within job discrimination that women in minority positions experience  using the wage gap decomposition method  this study analyzes the gender wage gap according to separate labor market positions  the results indicate that the size of the gender wage gap is greater in the primary labor market than in the secondary market  but that a sizable amount of the gap in the primary market can be explained by demographic differences between male and female workers  in the secondary labor market  the gender wage gap is relatively small  but mostly caused by within job wage discrimination against women  the divergent pattern of gender inequality large gap small discrimination among organizational insiders and small gap large discrimination between organizational outsiders shows how the segmented labor market provides a structural condition to create the complexity of gender inequality  in which women experience different forms of disadvantage depending on their positions in the labor market  
 rethinking media responsibility in the refugee  crisis   a visual typology of european news in this paper  we analyse how news images of the 2015 syrian refugee crisis  visualise refugees and how  in so doing  they mobilise various forms of moral responsibility in our  mediated public life   various practical dispositions of action towards the misfortunes of migrants and refugees at europe s border  on the basis of empirical material from european news  june december 2015   we construct a typology of visibilities of the crisis   each of which situates refugees within a different regime of visibility and claim to action  i  visibility as biological life  associated with monitorial action  ii  visibility as empathy associated with charitable action  iii  visibility as threat  associated with state security  iv  visibility as hospitality  associated with political activism  and v  visibility as self reflexivity  associated with a post humanitarian engagement with people like us   in conclusion  we argue that  important as these five categories of visibility are in introducing public dispositions to action towards the vulnerable  they nonetheless ultimately fail to humanise migrants and refugees  this failure to portray them as human beings with lives that are worth sharing should compel us  we urge  to radically re think how we understand the media s responsibility towards vulnerable others  
 retirement as a discrete life stage of farming men and women s biography  retirement generally marks the end of working life and the start of a new life stage  providing the potential for new contents and opportunities  while requiring adaptation of existing roles  retired swiss farming men and women usually continue working and living on the farm  but their roles change  drawing on conceptual approaches from gerontology research  we first aim to comprehend how farming men and women experience and understand retirement by describing major aspects of adaptation during their transition to retirement  second  we appraise the relevance of the retirement concept for the farming population  qualitative empirical evidence shows that retired farming men and women continue to devote time and energy to the farm for the sake of farm continuity and to maintain the farmers  work ethic  while transferring financial and managerial responsibility  poor health and the inability to contribute physically to the family farm appear as major threats for ageing  farmers  
 revenue management and length of stay based room pricing from a theoretical perspective  it is unclear whether hotels should offer a discount to customers who stay for longer periods  while it is rather clear that customers feel entitled to such length of stay  los  based discounts  accordingly  the major theoretical contribution of this study is to provide empirical evidence of hotels  los based pricing practices  the findings revealed that on average  hotels charge more per night when the guests stay longer  the finding that hotels increase their room rates as los increases  suggests that hotel revenue managers may want to address the customers  misinformed expectations of getting lower prices for longer los and or devise pricing or communication strategies to deal with it  
 revisiting the breen goldthorpe model of educational stratification we present an extension of the classic rational choice model for educational decisions that is able to explain recent empirical findings by gabay egozi et al  who established that israeli students from disadvantaged social strata tend to hedge long term utility with short term risk when choosing among subjects for their matriculation exams  adding to that  we show that the assumption of relative risk aversion as formulated in the breen goldthorpe model can be relaxed to a significant degree without losing its explanatory power regarding the persistence of class differentials in educational choices  this fact casts considerable doubt on the measurement of relative risk aversion in empirical research on the breen goldthorpe model and hence on the interpretation of the results of such studies  
 revitalizing the  civic  and  ethnic  distinction  perceptions of nationhood across two dimensions  44 countries and two decades this article describes how contemporary publics think about the nation along kohn s classic distinction between civic  and ethnic  nationalism  the article makes three contributes to the existing literature  firstly  it introduces a new statistical tool  multi classification analysis  to establish and analyse the two dimensional structure found in this and previous studies  secondly  it derives at an alternative interpretation  with a first dimension distinguishing the level of mobilization of nationalist attitudes and a second dimension distinguishing the relative emphasis given to civic and ethnic elements  thirdly  it demonstrates how this set up can be used to describe differences within countries  across countries and across time using all three rounds of international social survey programme data on national identity  the descriptions demonstrate a move towards mobilized ethnic nationalism in eastern europe  while a stable non mobilized civic nationalism prevails in many west european countries  despite the rise of new right wing parties  
 reviving icons to death  when historic photographs become digital memes iconic photographs possess broad social and symbolic significance  are widely replicated over time and circulated across media platforms  and fuel public discussion  in an era of digital memes  they have become generative resources for memetic performances that not only can draw on these images  historic authority but can also undermine it  based on the analysis of the accidental napalm  memes  our research leads to a fourfold taxonomy  from memes that expand or expound the meaning of the original picture to those that narrow and potentially destroy its significance  assessing hariman and lucaites  contention that appropriations of iconic images enhance civic engagement and public culture  we argue that some memes may actually dissolve the original significance of iconic photographs and potentially degrade  rather than enhance  public culture  
 righting the wrongs  contesting water property rights in southern ethiopia resolution of disputes and investigation of institutions that have attempted to right the wrongs  some of which have persisted for centuries  regarding pastoralists  property rights over indigenous water sources in east africa have rarely been the subject of formal study  using a framework of water property rights  hereafter konfi  we report on contestations over rights to the ancient tula wells in southern ethiopia  some of which have been in operation for more than 500 years  unlike grazing lands  which are communal resources  wells are private properties managed by corporate clan members  we reconstructed the history of contests over property rights to 64 wells and found that some contests over konfi have remained unresolved for many generations  only a small percentage  20   of the wells have no history of disputes over property rights  the resolution of disputes relies on the principal tenet of the non transferability of konfi property rights  except in the case of the family of the ancestral konfi dying out  contestants are expected to reconstruct how they lost the konfi in the first place  the borana tend to discourage contests over wells through the long duration of investigations  as well as myths associated with false claims that appeared to result in deaths among the claimants  
 risky bodies  risky spaces  maternal  instincts   swimming and motherhood swimming and aquatic activity are fields in which gendered  embodied identities are brought to the fore  and the co presence of other bodies can have a significant impact upon lived experiences  to date  however  there has been little research on sport and physical cultures that investigates how meanings associated with space impact upon women s embodied experiences of participating in swimming  specifically in the presence of their young children  using semi structured interviews and non participant observations  this qualitative study employed a foucauldian feminist framework to explore self perceptions and embodied experiences of aquatic activity amongst 20 women  who were swimming with children aged under four  results highlight that through felt  maternal responsibilities  the co presence of babies  and children s bodies shifted women s intentionality away from the self towards their child  mothers  embodied experiences were grounded in perceptions of space specific maternal instincts  and focused upon disciplining their children s bodies in the lived space of the swimming pool  key findings cohere around mothers  felt concerns about hygiene  water temperature and safety  and elements of intercorporeality and somatic empathy   
 rural to urban migration and rising evaluation standards for subjective social status in contemporary china people s evaluation standards in rating social status may evolve when exterior living circumstances change  and studying whether and how migration process changes individuals  evaluation standards in rating social status can shed new light on this issue  utilizing the dataset from 2010 2012 china family panel studies and by employing the anchoring vignette method  this study reveals for the first time that rural to urban migrants adopt higher standards than those who stay behind in the countryside  but their evaluation standards still remain significantly lower than those adopted by urban residents  heterogeneity in transitions of reference points within the migrants group is also explored  except for the eldest cohort  all other younger migrants employ significantly higher standards in rating social status than rural villagers  the new generation of migrants is not significantly different from the elder in terms of the evaluation standards  more importantly  the increase in evaluation standards of migrants becomes greater through the years  from the moment of departure from one s hukou registration place  these findings challenge the prevalent practice of assigning or assuming an ad hoc reference group to migrants in many studies  and advance our understanding on the determinants of the reference points used to evaluate social status  on which little is known so far  
 sardonic atheists and silly evangelicals  the relationship between self concept and humor style humor is widely used as a means of supporting group solidarity  but what determines the direction that this humor takes  i e  its quality and targets   i suggest that the answer lies in an interaction between self concept  perceptions of outgroups and micro group culture  aspects of self concept that are central for a group s identity work  especially how the group imagines outsiders  open possibilities for certain types of humor while closing off others  then micro cultural processes  heavily dependent on the exact persons present in a given interaction  influence the humorous forms used  this process explains why groups in roughly similar structural positions often make use of humor to generate solidarity in strikingly different ways  as well as why styles of humor vary  within limits  within groups  i provide illustrations of this process in two religious minority groups with very different humorous styles  atheists in the bible belt and evangelical christians in chicago  
 scared to death  reflections on panic and anxiety in the field this paper examines reflections about researcher emotions and the experience of having panic attacks and panic disorder as a result of fieldwork  anxiety and panic are sparsely discussed in methodological appendices and handbooks about qualitative research  and the embodiment of mental health in the field has received even less attention  i have two aims in the paper  to describe the experience of panic attacks and to open a discussion about panic and anxiety attacks in the field  the failure to address mental health problems as a result of fieldwork can negatively impact expert and fledgling ethnographers  and should be remedied  
 scholarly attention and the limited internationalization of us social science what parts of the world does american social science consider worthy of scholarly attention  analyzing the geographic focus of more than 2 million bibliographic records of journal articles  books  and dissertations  the study finds a weak trend toward internationalization of us social scientific attention over the past half century  moreover  the share of scholarly attention devoted to particular regions has remained surprisingly stable over this period  with western europe remaining the primary focus of internationally oriented work  shifts in us national security priorities  international trade  student demand  and demographic characteristics account for only a small portion of the variation in the rate of social scientific publications on world regions  lending credibility to the view that scholarly attention is shaped in large part by inertia that is built into academic institutions and cultures  
 school climate  deployment  and mental health among students in military connected schools research has found that when compared with civilian students  military connected students in the united states have more negative mental health outcomes  stemming from the stress of military life events  i e   deployment   to date  studies on military connected youth have not examined the role of protective factors within the school environment  such as school climate  in the mental health and well being of military connected adolescents  given this gap in the research on military adolescents  this study draws from a large sample of military and non military secondary adolescents in military connected schools  n   14 943  and examines associations between school climate  military connection  deployment  and mental health  findings show that multiple components of school climate are associated with a lower likelihood of depressive symptoms and suicidal ideation and increased likelihood of well being among students in military connected schools  after controlling for student demographics  military connection  and deployments  the authors conclude with a discussion of school climate interventions for military connected youth  
 science  politics and policy  how michiganders think about the risks facing the great lakes the great lakes region is an important ecological asset for the united states  yet studies show that several environmental risks threaten its viability  as a result  it is important to respond to these risks with effective policies  when and how policy is implemented often depends on public opinion and perceptions  yet  we understand little about how individuals from the great lakes region construct opinions about the threats facing the lakes  we seek to understand how individuals from the state of michigan form opinions on three risks to the lakes  invasive asian carp  climate change  and offshore drilling  to do this  we evaluate the utility of two dominant models of environmental opinion formation  trust and deference to scientific authority  and partisan bias and motivated reasoning  we find that when issues have been politicized  opinion is greatly influenced by political factors like partisanship but that trust and deference as well as underlying environmental attitudes play a more important role for issues that have not been politicized  we discuss the implications of these findings in terms of policy and communication in michigan  arguing that if we want michiganders to support policy consistent with science  they must view risk in ways that are consistent with scientific consensus  for that to happen  advocates and policy makers must focus on reducing the political rhetoric around these threats  developing communication that taps into underlying trust and deference to science  and using underlying attitudes about the role of government in environmental protection to promote environmental policy  
 scientific boundary work and food regime transitions  the double movement and the science of food safety regulation what role do science and scientists play in the transition between food regimes  scientific communities are integral to understanding political struggle during food regime transitions in part due to the broader scientization of politics since the late 1800s  while social movements contest the rules of the game in explicitly value laden terms  scientific communities make claims to the truth based on boundary work  or efforts to mark some science and scientists as legitimate while marking others as illegitimate  in doing so  scientific communities attempt to establish and maintain the privileged position of science in contests over policy  in this paper  we situate scientific boundary work within its world historical context in order to ask two key questions   1  how does scientific boundary work vary across food regimes  and  in turn   2  what role does scientific boundary work play in the political contestation that drives transitions between food regimes  we explore these questions through the case of one scientific community the aoac  association of official analytical communities  involved in food safety regulation across the british  us  and corporate food regimes  we argue that scientific boundary work is shaped by historically specific patterns of social conflict within food regimes and  in particular  the double movement dynamics that polanyi  the great transformation  the political and economic origins of our times  boston  beacon  1957 1944   theorizes  moreover  as scientific communities reconstruct their internal rules  norms  and procedures to claim their own legitimacy in relation to prevailing forms of social conflict  they also reshape who sets scientific agendas and thus the knowledge available for making new rules within periods of food regime transition  to elaborate this argument in theoretical terms  we build on recent efforts to integrate a neo polanyian perspective into food regime analysis and link this to research on scientific boundary work by scholars in science and technology studies

 secularization  religious plurality and position  local inter religious cooperation in contemporary sweden swedish society is characterized by secularization  and at the same time  as a result of migration  the country has become more pluralistic  an important consequence of this is the increasing possibilities for cooperation between different religious communities  and a variety of inter religious cooperation are currently taking place in sweden  the aim of the article is to show how inter religious cooperation arises and is maintained at a local level in sweden today  but also to highlight what the hurdles are  the article is based on interviews with people who in different ways were involved  or had chosen not to be involved  in inter religious cooperation at a local level in sweden  it is also based on participation in five local inter religious groups during 2010 and 2011  the study shows that inter religious cooperation at local level in sweden is largely influenced by differences in conditions between religious communities  these differences mainly derive from the positions the religious communities have in society  i e  there is a strong power imbalance between the religious communities that is clearly reflected in the inter religious cooperation  
 secure girls  class  sexuality  and self esteem public discourse is replete with talk about the fragility of young women s self esteem  linking poor self concept to a range of social problems associated with girlhood  we know little about the impact of these ideas on young women  in this article  we examine interviews with 66 girls  aged 14 22  to understand how they talk about the link between self esteem and sexual expression in everyday life  we find that girls  talk about self esteem uses classed meanings that unintentionally reinforce and extend the role of sexuality in girls  status hierarchies  benefitting those with more class resources  while policing all girls  abilities to claim sexual agency  
 seeking liberation  facing marginalization  asian americans and pacific islanders  conditional acceptance in hip hop culture using interview data with asian american and pacific islander  aapi  hip hop participants  we analyze how respondents construct hip hop as a liberating space where they can circumvent limiting racial and ethnic stereotypes  however  an intersectional lens reveals the constraints that hip hop s hypermasculinity places on aapi men as well as the ethnosexualized expectations that aapi women must negotiate  the experience of aapi men and women in hip hop due to their unique position in racial and gender hierarchies interacts with stereotypical notions of aapi people in wider society to relegate these participants to the margin rather than center of hip hop culture  thus  we find respondents  constructions of hip hop less an indicator of hip hop culture s openness than a statement of how constricting the mainstream u s  culture is for aapi americans  rendering hip hop s conditional acceptance preferable by comparison  
 seeking shelter in personal insolvency law  recession  eviction  and bankruptcy s social safety net many legal systems understand consumer insolvency laws as social insurance  providing relief and a  fresh start  to over indebted households who fall through gaps in the social safety net  personal insolvency law in england and wales in practice functions similarly  but in terms of legal principle and policy is ambivalent   sometimes emphasizing household debt relief other times creditor wealth maximization  this article assesses  in the context of novel debt problems brought to prominence by recession and austerity  the extent to which the law has embraced personal insolvency s social insurance function  the discussion is framed particularly by the escalating united kingdom housing crisis and the case of places for people v  sharpies concerning consumer bankruptcy s  non protection of debtors from eviction  the analysis illustrates how tensions between conceptual understandings and personal insolvency law s practical operation undermine the law s ability to fulfil its potential to produce positive policy responses to contemporary socio economic challenges  
 self placement in the social structure of sweden  the relationship between class identification and subjective social placement the aim of this study is to evaluate the relationship between the two assessments of subjective placement in the social structure   class identification and subjective social placement   in a top to bottom social hierarchy  in this article  the focus is on the association between working class identity and subjective social placement  the source material is derived from the international social survey programme from 2009 and 2012  the analysis reveals that women who identified with the working class to a higher extent located themselves towards the lower strata compared to their male counterparts  a result indicating that the female class structure may be more polarized than that of males  the results imply a need for more research concerning how women and men relate their objective class position to social status  as well as the relationship to different outcomes  such as subjective well being and social justice

 sequential mixed methods sampling  how quantitative secondary data can support qualitative sampling plans and theoretical sampling mixed methods sampling has played a minor role in methodological discussions so far  in particular  there is a lack of information about practical implementations and critical reflections of sampling decisions and sampling steps showing the benefits and challenges of different approaches  therefore  this paper demonstrates by drawing on an empirical example  how quantitative secondary data analysis  german socio economic panel  linked employer employee data  employment history  can support the empirically informed formation of contrast groups for qualitative sampling plans as well as field access to these contrast groups  furthermore  the article will show how an additional theoretical sampling can extend the empirically grounded composition of contrast groups and can build upon the quantitative secondary data  the discussion is based on a project with an explanatory sequential research design which combines quantitative secondary analysis with subsequent expert interviews with human resources managers in companies and narrative interviews with employees  the project focusses on the causes  practices  and consequences of employment relationships with an interrupted membership in the same employing organization   recalls

 service outsourcing and labour mobility in a digital age  transnational linkages between japan and dalian  china in this article  i examine the transnational mobility of digital workers and the control of their labour across multiple production sites  the digitalization of work has progressively allowed businesses to outsource it enabled service jobs to cheaper production sites offshore  the growth of the offshore outsourcing  of white collar service jobs in east asia has produced the mobility of cheap digital labour from japan to dalian in northeast china  they work at call centres and other japanese speaking workplaces in the lower echelons of the city s it sector  typically earning salaries in chinese yuan at  or even below  the average japanese minimum wage  based on ethnographic findings  i argue that in the global digital economy  digital services are rendered exploitable through their transnational mobility and that this form of labour migration has developed because of the partial  fluid and contingent nature of the transnational links between the two locations  i analyse how the neoliberal logic of exception underpins the creation of it parks in china and the casualization of labour in japan to enable new forms of transnational labour control and capital accumulation  
 settler humanitarianism  healing the indigenous child victim victims of colonial  indigenous child removal policies have attracted public expressions of compassion from indigenous and settler state political leaders in canada since the 1990s  this public compassion has fueled legal and political mechanisms  leveraging resources for standardized interventions said to heal these victims  cash payments  a truth telling forum  therapy  these claims to healing provide an entry point for analyzing how and why the figure of the indigenous child victim  past and present  is morally and politically useful for settler states and their public cultures  i use the formulation of settler humanitarianism to express how liberal interventions of care and protection  intended to ameliorate indigenous suffering  align with settler colonialism s enduring goal of indigenous elimination  wolfe 2006   removal of indigenous children was integral to the late nineteenth century formation of the canadian and australian settler states  missionaries and colonial administrators represented these practices as humanitarian rescue from depraved familial conditions  settler humanitarians have long employed universalizing moral registers  such as idleness and neglect  to compel state interventions into indigenous families  more recently  trauma has emerged as a humanitarian signifier compelling urgent action  these settler humanitarian registers do political work  decontextualized representations of indigenous children as victims negate children as social actors  obscure the particularities of how collective indigenous suffering flows from settler colonial dispossession  and oppose children s interests with those of their kin  community  and nation  i analyze how and why aboriginal healing as settler humanitarianism has been taken up by many indigenous leaders alongside settler state agents  and examine the ongoing social and political effects of the material and discursive interventions it has spawned  
 sex scandals  reputational management  and masculinity under neoliberal conditions this article presents political sex scandals as a critical site for understanding contemporary formations of masculinity under conditions of neoliberalism  while media coverage of sex scandals typically revolves around a spectacularized failure of a particular man to live up to an idealized image of masculinity  we contend that sex scandals represent momentary ruptures that lay bare historically specific contradictions of neoliberal masculine subjectivities  these inconsistencies reiterate abiding contradictions in dominant constructions of modern masculinity even as they assume unprecedented forms in today s technoculture  to make this case  we examine several modern political sex scandals  including those involving elliot spitzer  bob filner  and anthony weiner  
 sex work and social inequalities in the health of foreign migrant women in almeria  spain this paper is part of a broader study about prostitution among foreign migrant women in the province of almeria  spain  the specific aim of the paper is to analyse the different profiles of women working in the sex industry and interpret the social determinants that generate social inequalities in their health  the ethnographic research was conducted in different settings involved in the sex industry  clubs  private apartments  bars  immigrant settlements  and street prostitution  between 2009 and 2012 as part of the  damage reduction and health promotion  programme run by the ngo medicos del mundo  the research tools used were standardised and in depth interviews conducted with sex workers  and observation in their working environments  findings show that the main markers for major inequalities in terms of the health of women and the use of healthcare services available are  gender  being a woman   status as an immigrant  social class  level of education  and geographical area  this study argues the need to design programmes in local contexts of bio psycho social healthcare aimed at women who work as prostitutes with low earnings and very limited social support networks with a view to impacting on their safety  education and living conditions  as well as their lifestyles  and their physical and psychological health  
 sexual harassment and the construction of ethnographic knowledge it is not uncommon for women researchers to experience sexualized interactions  sexual objectification  and harassment as they conduct fieldwork  nevertheless  these experiences are often left out of ethnographers   tales from the field  and remain unaddressed within our discipline  in this article  we use women s experiences with harassment in the field to interrogate the epistemological foundations of ethnographic methodology within the discipline of sociology  based on more than 50 qualitative interviews  we examine three  fixations  of contemporary ethnography that inform women ethnographers  understandings of and reactions to harassment in the field  these fixations are solitude  danger  and intimacy  our data show that these fixations not only put researchers in danger but also have implications for the construction of ethnographic knowledge  they contribute to silence surrounding sexual harassment  and are motivated by and reproduce androcentric norms that valorize certain types of fieldwork  we argue that acknowledging and analyzing experiences with harassment and other unwanted sexual attention in the field is part of a more fully developed understanding of ethnographic research itself  
 sexual harassment in the military  individual experiences  demographics  and organizational contexts purpose  sexual harassment remains a persistent problem in the u s  military despite extensive research and policy initiatives  theoretical explanations identify individual circumstances  e g   power differentials  and organizational factors  e g   climate  culture   however  data constraints limit the capacity to link individual contexts with independent measures of environments  data methods  a unique defense equality opportunity climate survey allows assessment of organizational climates and individual experiences with multilevel analyses  results  sexist environmental context increases the likelihood of personal harassment experiences after controlling for individual level variables  however  unit level climate  group cohesion  and job satisfaction are not significant  conclusion  both individual and organizational factors are important  however  the organizational context has less to do with culture or unit cohesion and more to do with tolerance of sexism  focusing on problem units may be effective for reducing the prevalence and persistence of sexual harassment  
 sexual minority stress and same sex relationship well being  a meta analysis of research prior to the us nationwide legalization of same sex marriage meta analytic methods were used to analyze 179 effect sizes retrieved from 32 research reports on the implications that sexual minority stress may have for same sex relationship well being  sexual minority stress  aggregated across different types of stress  is moderately and negatively associated with same sex relationship well being  aggregated across different dimensions of relationship well being   internalized homophobia is significantly and negatively associated with same sex relationship well being  whereas heterosexist discrimination and sexual orientation visibility management are not  moreover  the effect size for internalized homophobia is significantly larger than those for heterosexist discrimination and sexual orientation visibility management  sexual minority stress is significantly and negatively associated with same sex relationship quality but not associated with closeness or stability  sexual minority stress is significantly and negatively associated with relationship well being among same sex female couples but not among same sex male couples  the current status of research approaches in this field is also summarized and discussed  
 sexual ized  harassment and ethnographic fieldwork  a silenced aspect of social research sexual ized  harassment during ethnographic fieldwork is often described by female researchers as a  rather common  experience  yet it continues to be marginalized in methodological discussions and anthropological training  rather than silencing accounts of these experiences  it is necessary to include them in the analysis of acquired data and to reflect on them in ethnographic writing  this article raises awareness and stimulates discussion about this neglected aspect of social research  it considers ethnography as a gendered practice in which gender norms  the  a sexuality of the fieldworker  and power relations directly influence research and the researcher s safety  it discusses the consequences of sexual ized  harassment for the ethnographer  makes suggestions regarding how to deal with it in situ  and highlights the complex relationship between personal safety and researchers  ethical obligations towards their informants  
 shadow capital  the democratization of college preparatory education in this article  we examine the manifestation and consequences of shadow capital within two public  urban  nonselective  college preparatory designated high schools serving exclusively nondominant students  informed by three years of ethnographic data  we argue that the transference of a historically elite college preparatory education from dominant institutions to nondominant schools results in fundamental changes to the dominant capital it is expected to yield  rather than generating highly valued capital within the field of education  it produces what we call shadow capital  as a distinct form of cultural capital  shadow capital outwardly resembles yet contains only traces of dominant cultural capital  thus failing to yield the same kind of exchange value in the postsecondary marketplace  shadow capital offers explanatory power for the many unmet promises of educational reform and further challenges the often well intended democratizing forces that paradoxically reinforce inequality in education  
 shame  vulnerability and belonging  reconsidering sartre s account of shame through positing that our capacity for physical vulnerability is at the core of original shame  sartre s account in being and nothingness reveals shame as an essential structure of human existence  reading sartre s ontological account of  pure shame  alongside recent writing about shame in early child development  particularly martha nussbaum s account of  primitive shame   this article will explore the inherent links between shame  the body and vulnerability  ultimately positing that our human need for belonging is the fundamental driving force behind shame  and what gives it its ontological status  in short  this article will argue that shame is not merely about a painful awareness of one s flaws or transgressions with reference to norms and others  but about a deeper layer of relationality through our bodily vulnerability  
 shopping with violence  black friday sales in the british context this article argues that the 2014 adoption of the us shopping tradition of black friday sales to stores and supermarkets in the united kingdom and beyond represents an important point of enquiry for the social sciences  we claim that the importation of the consumer event  along with the disorder and episodes of violence that accompany it  are indicative of the triumph of liberal capitalist consumer ideology while reflecting an embedded and cultivated form of insecurity and anxiety concomitant with the barbaric individualism  social envy and symbolic competition of consumer culture  through observation and qualitative interviews  this article presents some initial analyses of the motivations and meanings attached to the conduct of those we begin to understand as extreme shoppers  and seeks to understand these behaviours against the context of the social harms associated with consumer culture  
 should we stay or should we go  local and national factionalism in the national organization for women while the national organization for women  now  has endured over time  it has faced significant internal factionalism  in this article  i ask why some of these factions resulted in schisms  while other factions persisted in now over time  this is a critical question for understanding how organizational location and factional collective identities combine to produce different outcomes when internal conflict breaks out  my analysis of interview  archival  and secondary data indicates that organizational location influences factions  independent collective identities  shaping what they want and their perceptions of opportunities to change their organization  compared to national level factions  local factions also lack the ability to use now s hierarchical structure to their advantage in their effort to stay  this sheds lights on the distinct patterns of factionalism and schism in formalized groups  
 signaling perversion  senator david walsh and the politics of euphemism and dysphemism discussions of sexual reputation typically involve hints and innuendos  as sexual behavior often cannot be explicitly addressed in public domains  in this article we explore the role of signaling in the creation of reputation  particularly when reputational claims may not be directly articulated  we describe sexual signals in their reach  who learns of the claim  and through their realm  the transparency of meanings   we focus on the publicity of and response to a dramatic sexuality scandal from the second world war that alleged that a us senator frequented a gay brothel operated by nazi spies  this scandal   like others involving hidden sexuality   depended on signaling through the discursive forms of euphemism and dysphemism  requiring bounded subcultural knowledge  signaling relies on local knowledge  often sheltering the powerful by excluding broader publics  although we focus on the walsh case  similar dynamics operate in other scandals involving politicians  government officials  and public figures  
 silk blouses and fedoras  the female detective  contemporary tv crime drama and the predicaments of postfeminism this article examines the markedly contrasting fates of two recent female protagonist led police series  the dismally received prime suspect usa  nbc  2011  and widely celebrated the fall  bbc  2013     asking what the reception of each suggests about the state of play for women in tv crime drama in today s postfeminist culture  what do women cops need to do to make the cut in an era in which  on the one hand  it seems they are more prevalent and have more opportunities than ever before  gerrard  2014   but also  on the flip side of this  in which they must somehow offer something extra  to survive in an era where the presence of a female detective in itself is no longer an innovation or novelty  in an era in which  to adopt angela mcrobbie s much cited phrase  feminism has been taken into account   2007  255   how can these series  invocation of feminism or feminist issues  be understood as fundamental to their respective demise and triumph  i argue that  crucially  prime suspect usa s account of sexist bullying in the nypd was greeted as hackneyed and overblown  where the fall spoke adroitly to a media culture in which ratings can be won via a superficial but glossily packaged nod to the female detective s postfeminist progress   while relishing misogynistic violence  hence the article also asks  what implications does an inquiry of the kind undertaken here   where interrogation of the genre combines comparative text based analysis with critical reflection on the author s own perturbed response to the eroticisation of violence against women in the fall   have for future models of feminist criticism of tv crime drama

 small farms survival and growth  making investments despite credit constraints this article argues that we know little about how small farmers in post communist europe survive and even grow while having little access to credit markets  in approaching small farmers  this paper builds on ideas of self provisioning  contending that the tendency among small farmers is not one of growth towards and through economies of scale  but one of internalising and de monetising costs  by growing in order to control upstream and downstream links in the value chain  it asks what is it that makes self provisioning possible in two post communist regions  located in romania and ukraine  and identifies various assets in the smallholders  environments  such as most importantly a diverse scene of intermediaries supplying smallholders with cash incomes  the implication of the research is that the existence of these assets is crucial for the smallholders  survival and growth  and these assets should be valued accordingly rather than dismissed in favour of integrating smallholders into modern  retailer dominated  value chains  
 social capital and fear of crime in brisbane social capital is upheld for its value in explaining variations in crime across place  collective efficacy is understood to be the superlative link between less effectual components of neighbourhood social capital  such as social ties and reciprocity  and lower rates of crime  the current study examines the value of neighbourhood social capital in explaining another community attribute associated with neighbourhoods  fear of crime  we conduct a secondary analysis of survey data collected from over 2000 people clustered in 82 statistical local areas in brisbane  australia  to examine the correlates of fear of crime  we find that when comparing elements of social capital  the agentic element of social capital   collective efficacy   has the strongest relationship to reduced fear of crime  
 social disadvantage  severe child abuse  and biological profiles in adulthood guided by the stress process model and the life course perspective  we hypothesize   1  that childhood abuse is concentrated  in terms of type and intensity  among socially disadvantaged individuals  and  2  that experiencing serious abuse contributes to poor biological profiles in multiple body systems in adulthood  data came from the biomarker subsample of midlife in the united states  2004 2006   we used latent class analysis to identify distinct profiles of childhood abuse  each reflecting a combination of type and severity  results indicate that disadvantaged groups  women  and those from disadvantaged families are at greater risk of experiencing more severe and multiple types of abuse  those with more severe and multifaceted childhood abuse show greater physiological dysregulation  childhood abuse experiences partially accounted for the social status differences in physiological profiles  our findings underscore that differential exposure to serious childhood stressors plays a significant role in gender and class inequalities in adult health  
 social fabric and fear of crime  considering spatial location and time of day criminologists have long noted that social networks play a role in influencing residents  fear of crime  but findings vis a vis the exact nature of that role have been mixed  more social ties may be associated with less fear of crime through their role in collective action  trust  and emotional support  but also with more fear of crime because of their role in the diffusion of information on local crime patterns  in what follows  we suggest temporal and spatial distinctions in how social ties matter for fear of crime with respect to these different mechanisms  analysis of data from a large scale egocentric network study in southern california provides evidence for these claims   c  2016 elsevier b v  all rights reserved  
 social mechanisms and strategic action fields  the example of the emergence of the european research area the point of departure of this article is fligstein and mcadam s a theory of fields  it is argued that their theoretical framework would be strengthened by a more systematic focus in social mechanism based explanations since this would increase understanding of how new strategic action fields  safs  emerge  this argument is illustrated by exploring the emergence of the european research area  era  as a saf  in identifying social mechanisms the article draws both on fligstein and mcadam s studies and on academic capitalism literature  the main conclusion is that the emergence of the era was brought about by multiple social mechanisms such as collective attribution of threat opportunity  social appropriation and innovative collective action  coalition formation and boundary deactivation  moreover  the emergence of the era was a contested and complex process that faced considerable resistance from different actors  full implementation of the era is still an ongoing and open ended process  
 social network analysis of australian poly drug trafficking networks  how do drug traffickers manage multiple illicit drugs  international agencies report rising numbers of drug traffickers who deal in multiple drugs  poly drug traffickers   this paper explores how product diversification is managed in three australian poly drug trafficking syndicates  networks were constructed using judges  sentencing comments and social network analysis applied to examine the degree of specialisation  resource flows and management structure  if any   each syndicate had a clear management structure  but employed a different approach to diversifying including in house production of multiple products  syndicate 1  and outsourcing to other syndicates  syndicate 3   this suggests traffickers will have multiple avenues for product diversification  this may create challenges for their policing   c  2016 published by elsevier b v  
 social representations  news exposure  and knowledge gaps objective  studies show that public service broadcasters narrow knowledge gaps between politically interested and disinterested because such contexts encourage incidental learning  this reasoning  however  fails to explain why gendered knowledge differences persist in environments that equalize learning  using stereotype threat theory  i argue that news content emits symbolic gender cues that encourage or discourage women to become politically informed  methods  employing european election study 2009 voter data  n   27 000   and multilingual news content analyses from 27 e u  member states  i test whether more egalitarian representation of women as newsmakers correlates with narrower gaps between men and women  results  aggregate and multilevel models show that greater representation of women as newsmakers correlates with smaller gaps in news exposure and political knowledge  analyses also consider competing explanations such as women s electoral representation  education  labor force participation  and knowledge item guessing rates  conclusion  findings support the theoretical expectations regarding symbolic cues and knowledge gaps

 social theory and everyday marxists  russian perspectives on epistemology and ethics scholars have long tracked how the ussr  a laboratory of social engineering  was deeply informed by local readings of marxist social theory  why  then  in recent years  have so many historical and anthropological studies of russia excluded marxist from the list of main descriptors  or optics  through which they view their material  in this essay  i argue that in much contemporary scholarship marxism and its many afterlives have evidenced a kind of blind spot  reducing marxism to just an ideology  i assert that rediscovering the presence of marxism in russia as a gramscian hegemonic process and a vernacular that emerged among laymen can help us understand how a wide range of russians continue to make sense of their worlds today  drawing on several years of research in the city of perm  i interpret everyday conversations among middle age urbanites about morality  and demonstrate how this rediscovery of marxism can elucidate what things matter for russians today  and how  if social scientists proceed by acknowledging that professional and lay social knowledge increasingly share sources of theoretical inspiration  then we face a range of narrative challenges

 sociocultural determinants of female sexual desire older women are seen as asexual beings  as having old bodies that cannot be an object of desire or the author of pleasure  however  no scientific research has associated specific biological climacteric factors with the end of sexual activity and sexual desire  from an analysis of the national survey on sexual health and using the biopsychosocial model of sexuality proposed by delamater  2002  as a reference framework  the psycho sociocultural factors of the sex drive affecting women in the different stages of menopause are analysed  the results of this research confirm that sexual desire is influenced by a range of factors dependent on age  including having a steady partner  family responsibilities  state of health and the very definition of sexuality  
 sociocultural tensions and wicked problems in sustainable agriculture education future practitioners of sustainable agriculture and agroecology must have the capacity to address the wicked problems in the food system to make progress toward sustainability  undergraduate sustainable agriculture students from a variety of backgrounds may struggle with the question  is the challenging and complex work of addressing wicked problems of agroecology for me  our case study investigated sociocultural tensions associated with identity encountered when wicked problems teaching units were integrated into the advanced practices of sustainable agriculture course at a large  midwestern land grant university  the research and course employed a four part framework that focused on  1  attending to individual needs and identities   2  facilitating practice based and community based learning   3  engaging in problems situated in regional contexts  and  4  supporting awareness of local and global political and ecological issues  researchers used a community of practice theoretical lens  and focused on the sociocultural tensions that may have impacted individual and community identity formation  two wicked problems teaching units are described by drawing upon documentation and audio recordings from planning meetings  course sessions  student and instructor interviews  and course artifacts  vignettes were constructed to situate four interrelated types of sociocultural tensions encountered by instructors and students  these tensions reflected forces at the individual  community  local  and global levels which interact to influence learners  capacity to become full participants in sustainable agriculture  the study fills a gap related to affective dimensions of learning like identity in agroecology education  dilemmas and implications related to identity  pedagogy  and epistemology are discussed  
 socioeconomic status and the relationship between under reward and distress  buffering resource or status disconfirmation  a central feature of the sociological study of justice is its emphasis on how individuals  positions in the social structure intersect with justice processes  this study examines how individuals  socioeconomic status as assessed by education and income moderates any observed associations between perceived under reward and three forms of distress  anger  depression  and physical symptoms  using data from a national sample of american workers from diverse occupations  sectors  and social statuses  i test two competing hypotheses that articulate those contingencies  buffering resource and status disconfirmation  results indicate distinct patterns for education and income that are mostly consistent across different forms of distress  the moderation patterns for income are more in line with the buffering resource hypothesis  such that the relationships between perceived under reward and all three forms of distress are weaker among those with higher income  the moderation patterns for education  however  suggest evidence that supports both dynamics  higher education buffers the effect of slight under reward on the three distress outcomes  but does not buffer the effect of severe under reward  i integrate theories from the sociology of stress and distributive justice in an effort to better understand how the stress of under reward and social statuses intersect to shape distress  these discoveries speak to broader concerns about status based contingencies embedded in the social psychology of inequality and its distribution in the population  
 sociology as moral philosophy  and vice versa  in this article  i want to make an attempt to reconnect sociology to moral philosophy and moral philosophy to sociology  the thesis i want to defend is that sociology continues by other means the venerable tradition of practical and moral philosophy  like its forebears  it stands and falls with a defense of practical wisdom  aristotle  and practical reason  kant   the development of a moral sociology presupposes  however  that one recognizes and rejects max weber s theory of axiological neutrality as an extremist position and that one carefully articulates prescriptive and descriptive  internal and external  as well as observer and actor positions  
 solamente mexicanos  patterns and sources of hispanic diversity in us metropolitan areas rapid hispanic growth has been a major source of increasing ethnoracial diversity in the united states  however  diversity within the hispanic population is frequently obscured by the tendency to lump all latinos together  our study examines hispanic diversity at the local level  drawing insights from the mexican dominance  caribbean centric settlement  spatial assimilation  and economic opportunity perspectives  measures of the magnitude and structure of hispanic origin group diversity during the 1990 2010 period are constructed for 363 metropolitan areas based on each area s shares of mexicans  puerto ricans  cubans  dominicans  salvadorans  guatemalans  colombians  and  others   we find that diversity magnitude varies markedly across metropolitan hispanic populations  although the most diverse metro areas lack a majority origin group  mexicans often constitute a majority or plurality of local latinos  diversity levels and structures have remained relatively stable over time  in both 1990 and 2010  metro areas with more diverse  multigroup hispanic communities are distinguished by their larger size  smaller proportion of hispanics  location farther from mexico and closer to the caribbean  and greater odds of being a military hub  they also exhibit higher rates of housing construction and lower rates of agricultural and manufacturing employment  we use weighted data to show that dominican metro dwellers experience the highest hispanic diversity while the average mexican lives in an area where four fifths of all latinos are mexican  overall  our results provide primary support for the mexican dominance perspective but some support for the other three perspectives as well   c  2017 elsevier inc  all rights reserved

 solidarity networks of spanish migrants in the uk and germany  the emergence of interstitial trade unionism this article aims to study the collective strategies and social networks of young spanish emigrants in the european union  paying special attention to their perceptions of and practices regarding working conditions  as well as their relationships with the trade unions and social movements  the article focuses on two case studies of migrant self organisation networks  the union action group of berlin  germany and the solidarity federation in brighton  uk  on the basis of semi structured interviews and document analysis  the article concludes that the existing gap between trade unions and migrant labour can  under certain circumstances  favour the emergence of solidarity networks which in part play the role of trade unions  we call this type of organisation interstitial trade unionism  
 speculative futures in the time of debt this article concerns the temporality of debt  against the claim that the society of debt has emptied out futures via the elevation of the promise to pay to a total social fact  it suggests that the time of securitized debt is speculative in form  thus  in the time of securitized debt  pasts  presents and futures do not stand in a pre set relation to one another  but are open to a constant state of revision  they may be drawn and redrawn  assembled and disassembled  set and reset  this time is tracked across changing schedules of household and personal debt   and crucially in the logics of accumulation via securitized debt   to argue that far from emptying out futures debt society demands subjects who must constantly adjust to recalibrations of pasts  presents and futures as well as to changes in the relations between and across these states

 spillover effects  explaining narrative divergences of the christian right  1979 1989 a case study of two organizations central to the christian right  the moral majority and concerned women for america  shows that the movement s core narrative of redemption split into two narratives that emphasized either of two meanings of redemption   1  to reform society  and  2  to save sinners through prayer  i document the divergence by analysis of organizational publications  i find that the christian right s relationship with the new right shaped the expression of this redemption narrative  resulting in these two versions of a core narrative  spillover between the two movements occurred through organizational networks and contact between new right organizations and christian right leaders  spillover effects are evident in the ideological content  political training  and issues frames developed by moral majority and concerned women for america  these findings suggest that we must consider how movements accommodate divergent core narratives

 sports and structured leisure as sites of victimization for children and young people in finland  looking at the significance of gender and ethnicity availability and access have been central worries that are discussed related to children s and young people s sport and other structured leisure activities  in this article  we shift the focus towards children s and young people s experiences of violence perpetrated by coaches or leaders within such activities in finland  we use a large scale survey on children s and young people s experiences of violence in different spheres of life  finnish child victim survey 2013  as the data  and concentrate on the significance of gender and ethnicity for the experiences of violence within structured leisure  the results show that boys report significantly higher levels of emotional  physical and sexual violence perpetrated by a coach or a leader within leisure activities than girls  and immigrant background seems also to increase the risk of being victimized  with the help of logistic regression analysis  we assess the role of other background factors in experiencing violence within structured activities  but conclude that the significance of gender and ethnicity persists even when factors related to the family background are taken into consideration  
 sportswomen and social media  bringing third wave feminism  postfeminism  and neoliberal feminism into conversation in this article  we take seriously the challenges of making sense of a sporting  and media  context that increasingly engages female athletes as active  visible  and autonomous  while inequalities pertaining to gender  sexuality  race  and class remain stubbornly persistent across sport institutions and practices  we do so by engaging with three recent feminist critiques that have sought to respond to the changing operations of gender relations and the articulation of gendered subjectivities  namely  third wave feminism  postfeminism  and neoliberal feminism  and applying each to the same concrete settingthe social media self representation of hawaiian professional surfer alana blanchard  in aiming to conceptually illustrate the utility of these three feminist critiques  we are not advocating for any single approach  rather  we critically demonstrate what each offers for explaining how current discourses are being internalized  embodied  and practiced by young  sports women  as they make meaning of  and respond to  the conditions of their lives  
 starting out on a judicial career  gender diversity and the appointment of recorders  circuit judges  and deputy high court judges  1996 2016 this article is a quantitative study of those who are appointed recorders and circuit judges  and who are authorized or appointed as deputy high court judges  it considers the period 1996 2016  being the twenty years that straddle either side of the creation of the judicial appointments commission  jac   a key focus is the gender diversity of these appointments and how this has changed over time  including whether the transfer of appointments to the jac has made a difference to gender diversity or whether increases in the proportions of female judges are attributable solely to a changing demographic among the pool of lawyers from which such judges tend to be appointed  who are appointed to these positions is significant both because of the importance of the positions themselves  but also because they comprise the pool from which  as a practical reality  the senior judiciary is appointed  
 state building and religion  explaining the diverged path of religious change in taiwan and south korea  1950 1980 in this article  the authors develop a theory of religious change based on the linked ecological understanding of the state building process  to tackle the question of why the diverged path of religious change took place in south korea and taiwan in the 1970s  specifically  this article aims to explain three related puzzles   1  given the fact that the growth of christianity in taiwan and south korea was similar in the 1950s  why  in the late 1960s  did christianity begin to grow explosively in south korea while it stagnated in taiwan   2  why did this explosive growth in south korea occur during the park chung hee regime   3  why did other religions  e g   buddhism  also grow rapidly in south korea during the same period  using several original materials  the authors demonstrate the central role of different state building processes in sparking the diverged religious change in these two societies  
 state space beyond territory  wormholes  gravitational fields  and entanglement neo weberian historical sociology and political science establishes that territory is a defining feature of the modern state  drawing on insights from political geography  i argue that territory  is not a pre existing physical location  but an effect produced by state practices and technologies  the spatial fetish of territory  moreover  distracts analytical attention from the equally important non territorial dimensions of the state  to map these new and unfamiliar dimensions  i propose three analogies from the study of physics   wormholes  gravitational fields  and quantum entanglement   as powerful conceptual devices with the potential to reorient social scientists towards a fuller understanding of state space

 strangers in the land  anger and mourning on the american right  a journey to the heart of our political divide reaction to david rieff s book is bound to be mixed  its particulars are brilliant  its flaws  profuse  in praise of forgetting is misleadingly titled  for rieff focuses primarily on the social functions of memory and its relation to history and forgetfulness  in his view  every event and person  no matter how notable today  will be ultimately forgotten  but in the short run  forgetfulness is benign  leading to reconciliation and peace  memory  in contrast  is always malignant and distorted  yet so influential as to merge with and erode history  rieff s assertions are matched against the cases he himself adduces  cases which he describes selectively and with minimal regard for evidence  however tendentious his arguments  the insights and vast erudition to which david rieff treats his readers are undeniable  
 strategies of valuation  repertoires of worth at the financial margins this article draws upon thirteen months of ethnographic research in a chicago pawnshop to show how prices of objects in pawnshops are actively  socially negotiated using what i term discursive strategies of valuation  three kinds of discursive strategies of valuation emerge repeatedly in the data  a  references to the specific material attributes of the objects  b  references to the unique biographical histories of the objects  c  reference to the financial need and  relative  social positioning of the customer involved in the negotiation  examining these strategies reveals the relationship between socially contingent and culturally constructed perceptions of value and the production of price  i find that rhetorical strategies can and do affect price  within limits  perhaps most surprisingly  the data show that discursive strategies emphasizing a lower socio economic status can inflate the value  and ultimately the price  of an object during negotiations

 students mobility  assessing the determinants of attractiveness across competing territorial areas a central question for education authorities has become  which factors make a territory attractive for tertiary students   tertiary education is recognised as one of the most important assets for the development of a territory  thus students  mobility becomes a brain drain issue whenever there are prevalent areas that attract students from other territories  in this paper  we try to identify the most important factors that could affect student mobility in italy  in doing that we analyse students  flows across competing territorial areas which supply tertiary education programs  we will consider a wide range of determinants related to the socio economic characteristics of the areas as well as resources of the universities in the territories in terms of variety and quantity of the degree programs there available  financial endowments provided by central government  and services available to students  the bradley terry modelling approach based on pair comparisons has been adopted to define the attractiveness of competing territories and assess how much the detected divergences can be attributed to factors directly related to the considered characteristics of the universities in the territory and how much is ascribable to inherent characteristics of the areas where the universities are located such as the labour market conditions  furthermore  the adopted approach allows us to consider uncertainty in defining territorial attractiveness and making comparisons  in this way  we would like to provide some evidences to assess if the rules currently used by the central government to finance public universities on the basis of their capabilities to attract students really reward the efforts made by the university system in the area to improve their standard of quality or  on the contrary  reward the territorial features  
 studying neighborhood crime across different macro spatial scales  the case of robbery in 4 cities whereas there is a burgeoning literature focusing on the spatial distribution of crime events across neighborhoods or micro geographic units in a specific city  the present study expands this line of research by selecting four cities that vary across two macro spatial dimensions  population in the micro environment  and population in the broader macro environment  we assess the relationship between measures constructed at different spatial scales and robbery rates in blocks in four cities  1  san francisco  high in micro  and macro environment population   2  honolulu  high in micro  but low in macro environment population   3  los angeles  low in micro  but high in macro environment population   4  sacramento  low in micro  and macro environment population   whereas the socio demographic characteristics of residents further than 1 2 mile away do not impact robbery rates  the number of people up to 2 5 miles away are related to robbery rates  especially in the two cities with smaller micro environment population  implying a larger spatial scale than is often considered  the results show that coefficient estimates differ somewhat more between cities differing in micro environment population compared to those differing based on macro environment population  it is therefore necessary to consider the broader macro environment even when focusing on the level of crime across neighborhoods or micro geographic units within an area   c  2017 elsevier inc  all rights reserved  
 stumbling on the rehabilitation gold  foucault vs  foucault in san quentin and beyond this article examines grip  a rehabilitation program currently spreading through california s state prison system  while most violent offenders  come to grip hoping to increase chances of parole  this yearlong program with four main components   stopping violence  mindfulness  emotional intelligence  understanding victim impact   is meant to create conditions in which inmates can do the work  leading to genuine transformation  a central claim is that due in part to the trauma treatment model grip follows  inmates end up stumbling on the gold  and going through changes  involving recovery of an authentic self  rooted in childhood  that helps enable skillful responses even to moments of imminent danger   understandably  researchers of such programs may seek theoretical inspiration from the dominant  version of foucault  yet this paper sets out to change the conversation about prisons and rehabilitation in part by demonstrating the utility of the other  foucault s pragmatic recovery of body based self disciplining practices and regimes  
 sudanese refugee youth and educational success  the role of church and youth group in supporting cultural and academic adjustment and schooling achievement there is a burgeoning body of research about refugee youth that adopts a deficit approach by focusing on the problems and barriers youth encounter in adjusting culturally and academically to schools  less research takes an asset approach through an examination of the strengths refugee youth bring to formal schooling and how these assets can be built upon to support academic achievement and cultural adjustment  in this article  we challenge these deficit notions  through examining the everyday spaces inhabited by sudanese refugee youth living in regional new south wales  australia  our research poses the question  what role do institutions outside school play in supporting sudanese refugee youth as they move from one culture to another  the question is significant because little research has examined the role played by institutions outside school  e g   church  youth groups and sporting associations in fostering the social and cultural capital required for refugee youth to integrate within the broader community  and to engage successfully in schooling  drawing on bourdieuian concepts of cultural and social capital and habitus  we suggest that religious affiliation enabled the young people to access social capital through  prosocial and proeducational moral directives   barrett  2010  p  467   moreover  religious involvement provided refugee youth with access to socially legitimised forms of cultural capital  these forms of capital shaped the students  habitus and contributed to school adjustment and achievement  we conclude that future research is needed to examine the role that church and other institutions outside school play in contributing to cultural and academic adjustment  
 suffering and liberation in the age of therapy  germany s  grandchildren of the second world war  this article focuses on the kriegsenkel    the german grandchildren of the second world war   born in the 1960s and 1970s  kriegsenkel feel that through processes of transgenerational transmission unresolved war experiences were passed on to them by their families and are largely responsible for their emotional problems   from depression and anxiety disorders to relationship break ups and career problems  i explore how  after decades of public taboos on the suffering of the majority population  this emergent identity is constructed and addressed entirely within the framework of western therapeutic culture  sociologists have long critiqued therapy culture for promoting political disengagement and attitudes of victimhood  based on more than 80 ethnographic interviews  i argue that this view needs to be moderated to account for the ways in which individuals use therapeutic culture to exert agency and devise strategies to actively deal with emotional distress in an environment where wartime suffering is considered politically sensitive  
 sustaining farming on marginal land  farmers  convictions  motivations and strategies in northeastern germany contrary to a scholarly debate that anticipated a trend towards the marginalisation of agriculture in many rural areas of europe  farmers have continued to utilise agro economically marginal land  especially in a variety of areas in europe s northwest  we explore why and how farmers secure the development of their farms while cultivating crops on the margins  based on qualitative empirical research in brandenburg  germany  by bringing together farmers  motivations and convictions with their agricultural and agronomical practices  the study identifies three farming strategies for managing farms on marginal land  focused on independence  balancing multiple aims  or optimising land productivity  we develop a concept of farming strategy as an expression of personal motivations and convictions in a coherent  targeted  long term plan for farming  we discuss the implications of such an understanding for system oriented  micro sociological research and for the perpetuation of agriculture in marginalised rural areas  
 sws 2016 feminist lecture  reducing gender biases in modern workplaces  a small wins approach to organizational change the accumulation and advancement of gender scholarship over past decades has led us to the point where gender scholars today can leverage our deep understanding of the reproduction of gender inequality to develop and test models of change  in this lecture  i present one such model designed to reduce the negative effects of stereotypic biases on women s workplace outcomes  after synthesizing the literature on stereotyping and bias and showing the limits of past change efforts  i develop a small wins model of change  key to this model is that researchers work with teams of managers to produce concrete  implementable actions that produce visible results  i argue that small wins motivate further action and are the building blocks to larger organizational transformation  preliminary results from several case studies show that this approach can produce important changes in the short run  such as reducing gender biases in workplace evaluations  and that these small wins can inspire longer run change  such as increases in the rate of hiring women  
 symbolic boundaries and migrants  boundary work in referring to the literature on symbolic boundary marking and stigmatization and based on an analysis of eleven group discussions including 55 migrants stemming from many different countries we reconstruct immigrants  experiences with their first names in germany and their strategies of boundary marking and stigma management  the results show that all the participants are very much aware of the fact that first names function as an important marker of symbolic and social boundaries between the majority society and immigrant minorities  at the same time  the interviewees differ regarding the way they react to the boundaries experienced  four types of boundary work can be distinguished   each with its own specific basic orientations  border crossing  i   border blurring  ii   border transvaluation  iii   and boundary irrelevance and in group orientation  iv   we describe each type extensively with reference to the theoretical literature  
 symbolic closure  towards a renewed sociological perspective on the relationship between higher education  credentials and the graduate labour market this article explores how our understanding of the graduate labour market can be improved by re assessing some of the insights of the conflictual tradition within sociology  in particular  its theorising of social closure  and the use of educational credentials within the labour market remain highly relevant  yet these ideas need to be modified to better deal with the current social  economic and educational contexts  this article extends the social closure literature to deal with some of the changes within the graduate labour market by turning to pierre bourdieu s ideas on symbolic violence  i will argue that symbolic closure   the reliance on exclusion through categorisation and classification  becomes of greater importance in a graduate labour market that no longer offers any clarity about what graduate skills  jobs and rewards constitute and signify  
 tackling inequalities in political socialisation  a systematic analysis of access to and mitigation effects of learning citizenship at school this article tackles the issue of social inequalities in voting and identifies how and when differences in learning political engagement are influenced by social background in the school environment between the ages of 11 16 in england  using latent growth curve modelling and regression analysis on the citizenship education longitudinal  cels  data this research identifies two elements that influence the political socialisation process  access to political learning and effectiveness in the form of learning in reducing inequalities in political engagement  the results show that there is unequal access by social background to learning political engagement through political activities in school and through an open classroom climate for discussion  however  there is equal access by social background to citizenship education in schools and this method of learning political engagement is effective at the age of 15 16 in reducing inequalities in political engagement   c  2017 the authors  published by elsevier inc  
 talking to whom  the changing audience of north korean nuclear tests objectives  in this study  we develop a model based on big data analysis to find patterns in north korean nuclear provocations  methods  using automated text analysis classification through supervised machine learning techniques  we analyze the north korean central news agency  kcna  from 1997 to 2013  results  we find an interesting difference between the kim jong il era and the kim and jong un period  implying a major shift in the nuclear policy of pyongyang  while kim jong il  who had a firm grip on power  focused on the international audience before conducting nuclear tests  kim jong un during his succession targeted the domestic audience prior to nuclear tests  probably in an attempt to consolidate his precarious power  conclusion  the machine learning technique allows us to analyze the effect of political communication even in authoritarian governments  
 telemedicine and the senses  a review telemedicine technologies have been presented as solutions to the challenges of equitable  cost effective and efficient health service provision for over two decades  the ways in which the sensory dimensions of medical care and the doctor patient relationship are mediated via telemedicine can be important contributors to the success  failure or unintended consequences of telemedicine  in this article  we present a review of the relevant literature in social research that provides insights into the sensory dimensions of telemedicine  in addition to considering important relevant work undertaken in the sociology of health and illness  we incorporate perspectives and research from other disciplines and fields that we believe can contribute to the development of scholarship on this topic  we contend that when doctors  patients and other healthcare workers enact telemedicine  sensory judgements have become  in part  a sensing of sensors  viewing healthcare practitioners and patients as always and already digital data assemblages of flesh code space place affect senses  demanding certain kinds of body work and data sense making  constitutes a productive theoretical approach for future enquiries into telemedicine and other digital health technologies  
 television format as cultural technology transfer  importing a production format for daily drama since the 1990s  tv formats have become an essential part of the global trade on television programmes  while many of the most popular television programmes today are format adaptations  theorisations on television formats have remained few  this article introduces production format as a specific type of television format  while television formats usually trade both programme content and a mode of production  production format solely contains information on how production can be best managed and organised  production format can thus be studied as cultural technology transfer  a finnish daily drama titled salatut elamat serves as an example of importing and adapting a production format created by the australian based grundy company  the article first presents some theorisations on television formats and reviews technology transfer theory  then tracing the origin of grundy s production format and analysing the acquisition and adaptation of the format in finland  finally  the production format is evaluated in both industrial and scholarly terms  by establishing a new concept for analysing television formats  the study will contribute to format studies and production studies  
 telling stories  credibility and the representation of social actors in australian asylum appeals to secure protection in the global north  asylum seekers must overcome restrictive government policies and present a convincing refugee narrative  their credibility becomes their main asset and must survive the multiple challenges arising from intercultural communication and interactions involving multiple institutional actors  aiming to explore the impact institutional understandings of refugee narrative creation have on credibility assessment  i present the findings of an analysis of a corpus of documents from the australian tribunal responsible for the administrative review of asylum decisions  i critically analyse these texts to identify how the tribunal and its agents discursively present the various actors involved in asylum appeals  i argue that despite the cautions of existing scholarship  these texts present the asylum seeker as the sole author of the final refugee narrative  regardless of the role that decision makers and other actors  such as lawyers and interpreters  play in its co construction  thus  the institution places disproportionate responsibility on the asylum seeker for communication outcomes  creating significant challenges for their credibility  
 tenure and spending within uk households at the end of the recent recession housing costs form a substantial share of aggregate demand in the uk  this study examines the distribution of total expenditure to income by homeownership status at the end of the recent recession in 2010  multivariate quantile regressions uncover four important points  first  owner occupiers in england have considerably higher mean spending ratios than their peers in other parts of the uk  an indication of their wealthier status  second  the average spending ratio for residential occupiers in all uk regions  with the exception of northern ireland  is significantly higher than the mean ratio for tenants in both private and public properties  in this last region  the spending rate for private tenants is more prominent  third  the disparity in the expenditure ratio between owner occupiers and tenants is significantly more pronounced in england  fourth  renters in public housing in scotland and wales have much higher spending ratios than their counterparts in private properties  reflecting a greater overall social security provided by the devolved government there  policy implications allied with heterogeneity in the consumption effect of housing wealth across the different homeownership cohorts is discussed  
 testing the great lakes compact  administrative politics and the challenge of environmental adaptation this article examines public involvement in the six year administrative review of an application by waukesha  wisconsin  to draw water from lake michigan to replace its radium contaminated local water supply  the article shows that public positions on the proposal inverted the typical relationship between partisanship and environmental attitudes  prompting both supporters and opponents to ignore scientific evidence and the central matter of water safety  in successive rounds of state and regional administrative review  these political stances induced administrators to engage in increasingly legalistic forms of assessment  although waukesha s application was approved in 2016  such administrative dynamics may limit the ability of the recently enacted great lakes compact to address current and prospective water safety problems in the region  the case typifies an emerging pattern in water governance in the united states  contentious administrative politics drive cooperative agreements to resemble adversarial proceedings  limiting their ability to adapt to new environmental problems  
 the  old gym  and the  boys  changing rooms   the performative and pleasurable spaces of boys  physical education this article examines how space and pleasure are discursively interlinked in boys  performances of gender in school physical education  pe   although previous research has implicated spaces in the production of gendered identities and unequal power relations  there exists a gap in the current literature focusing on how space also contributes to pleasure in pe  this article draws on an ethnographic account of boys  pe  and gregson and rose s  2000  concept of performative space   an extension of butler s  1990  notion of performativity  to illustrate how the pre existing spaces of pe come to matter or become meaningful through the boys  performances with in those spaces  i argue that the boys derive pleasures as the productive effect of the power  foucault  1985  articulated in and through the spaces of pe  this article accordingly contributes to understandings of the complex nature of how pe is constituted and constitutive of gendered performances  spaces and pleasures  
 the  reasonable man   his nineteenth century  siblings   and their legacy the reasonable man is the best known  but not the only  legal construct to be born into the nineteenth century common law  this article introduces the man s siblings including those from the areas of trust law  criminal law  contract law  and intellectual property law  both patents and trademarks   the fact that some of these  men  changed the law is not controversial  this research firrther highlights that while several of these came to life in that century  only some had a significant role into the twentieth century  those that did are tied to the foundations of our society through their role in facilitating innovation and consumer protection  the argument is that it was the constructs  nature and their capacity to accommodate public policy issues that enabled the vitality of the  reasonable person   negligence  and the person skilled in the art   patents   
 the 3rd scheme between secularism and religion muslim societies and islam in the west are in need of an anthropological shift in islamic thought  global regimes abuse the religious argument for the purpose of obedience towards totalitarian rule  hence  islam as a kind of regal religion becomes the basis for the violation of the ethical standards it stands for  peace  justice and security  however  the contingent situation between religious and secular world views requires new pragmatic approaches in terms of conflicting assumptions of authority  the koran entails some intriguing answers to this challenge that deserve further attention  
 the actionability of exome sequencing testing results genomic tests such as exome sequencing have recently become an option for diagnosing patients  the tests allow clinical geneticists to sequence the majority of patients  disease causing genetic variants  as a new technology  exome sequencing confronts the question of what the benefit is of this increased genetic information  against a narrow perspective of clinical utility that emphasises tangible improvements in a patient s disease management  professional organisations have argued that genomic sequencing should be considered beneficial if it helps families and society  based on video recorded observations of the return of exome sequencing results to parents of a child with disabilities in the clinic and in depth interviews with these parents  we examine how genomic test results become actionable in the clinical encounter  we find that parents and clinicians marshal exome results beyond biomedical diagnostic and management goals to address questions about guilt for causing the disabilities and to secure access to disability related services  we argue that genomic actionability rests on the interaction between the biological characteristics of genetic results and the predicaments facing parents of children with disabilities  
 the association between generalized trust and physical and psychological health across societies prior research found that physical and psychological health are positively associated with generalized trust of others  this association is known to vary across societies  though the extent of this variation and its source remains poorly understood  the current research examined whether differences in development across societies describe why the effects of trust on health differ across societies  drawing on the dataset from the world values survey  we found that the participants  generalized trust was associated with their physical health  happiness  and life satisfaction  multi level analysis showed that these associations varied substantially across societies  for physical health and happiness  the variation was related to differences in societal development  generalized trust was more strongly associated with physical health and happiness in developed societies than in developing societies  
 the association of ethnic pride with health and social outcomes among young black and latino men after release from jail the goal of this study was to understand whether ethnic pride among young  incarcerated black and latino men was associated with successful community reentry  we interviewed 397 black and latino men 16 to 18 years old in a new york city jail and then again 1 year after their release to determine the relationship between participants  sense of ethnic pride during incarceration  and substance use  violence  recidivism  and education employment after release from jail  participants with higher ethnic pride scores were less likely to engage in illegal activities and be reincarcerated  ethnic pride was also associated with feeling safe in gangs and positive attitudes toward avoiding violence in situations of conflict  ethnic pride was not associated with substance use  education  or engagement in community based organizations post release  this study demonstrated that ethnic pride might be a source of strength that young men of color can harness for successful community reentry after release from jail  
 the aural and moral idylls of  englishness  and folk music the idea of englishness is explored as an historical social construction that is subject to ongoing negotiation  important features of englishness are embedded in the sacralized symbolism of the rural idyll  which represents traditional english values  landscapes and soundscapes are utilized to construct personal and national identities in periods of revivalism  by viewing english folk music through an interactionist framework  responses to the music build upon earlier collective works that have shaped traditional song  englishness is problematized as either an inclusive  or exclusive  identity  ideational artifacts thus provide a foundation for social action  1  sup  
 the best predictors of survival  do they vary by age  sex  and race  we consider a broad set of variables used by social scientists and clinicians to identify the leading predictors of five year survival among american adults  we address a question not considered in earlier research  do the strongest predictors of survival vary by age  sex or race ethnicity  the analysis uses hazard models with 30 well established predictors to examine five year survival in the national health and nutrition examination survey  we find that the simple measure of self assessed health and self reported measures of functional ability and disability are the strongest predictors in all demographic groups  and are generally ranked considerably higher than biomarkers  among the biomarkers  serum albumin is highly ranked in most demographic groups  whereas clinical measures of cardiovascular and metabolic function are consistently among the weakest predictors  despite these similarities  there is substantial variation in the leading predictors across demographic groups  most notably by race and ethnicity 
 the biophysical effects of neolithic island colonization  general dynamics and sociocultural implications does anthropogenic environmental change constrain long term sociopolitical outcomes  it is clear that human colonization of islands radically alters their biological and physical systems  despite considerable contextual variability in local specificities of this alteration  i argue that these processes are to some extent regular  predictable  and have socio political implications  reviewing the data for post colonization ecodynamics  i show that neolithic colonization of previously insulated habitats drives biotic homogenization  i argue that we should expect such homogenization to promote regular types of change in biophysical systems  types of change that can be described in sum as environmentally convergent  such convergence should have significant implications for human social organization over the long term  and general dynamics of this sort are relevant in the context of understanding remarkably similar social evolutionary trajectories towards wealth inequality not only islands  but also more generally  
 the boomerang effect  innovation in the blogs of mainstream news sites  2008 2012 this article examines the tension between the possibilities afforded by innovations in news production and the normalizing force of established routines through a quantitative and qualitative study of blogging in five leading news sites in the united states over a 5 year period  2008 2012   the quantitative examination shows that the prevalence of the native storytelling features of blogs in the online editions of these sites was higher in 2008 than in 2012  with this decrease being relatively gradual during this period  the qualitative analysis suggests that during 2008  a significant minority of blogs in established news organizations operated as spaces that presented news in a personal and opinionated tone  this novelty wore down gradually  and by 2012  the vast majority of blogs exhibited a preponderance of the straight news storytelling format  and blogs were used mostly as a vehicle for disseminating breaking news  the discussion draws on these findings to reflect on the theoretical and methodological implications of the study for accounts of innovation in journalism and the news  
 the bureaucratic harassment of us servicewomen focusing on the u s  military as a gendered and raced institution and using 33 in depth interviews with u s  servicewomen  this study identifies tactics and consequences of workplace harassment that occur through administrative channels  a phenomenon i label bureaucratic harassment  i identify bureaucratic harassment as a force by which some servicemen harass  intimidate  and control individual  as well as groups of  servicewomen through bureaucratic channels  examples include issuing minor infractions with the intention of delaying or stopping promotions  threatening to withhold military benefits for reporting sexual abuse harassment  and revoking servicewomen s qualifications in order to remove them from positions or units  the manipulation of administrative rules and regulations is made possible by the interplay between a gendered and raced organizational climate and bureaucratic features such as discretion  hierarchy  and the blending of work and personal life  i show that bureaucratic harassment has both raced and gendered implications  ultimately  harassment that is enacted through bureaucratic means is often overlooked but carries distinct consequences for the professional careers and workplace experiences of the victims  
 the civic engagement gap s   youth participation and inequality from 1976 to 2009 civic participation in the united states is highly unequal  resulting in a civic engagement gap between socioeconomic  racial  and gender groups  variation in civic participation and the civic engagement gap remain contested  primarily as a result of inconsistent definitions and measurement issues in previous work  using consistent measures from the monitoring the future study from 1976 to 2009  i analyze whether sociodemographic gaps in youth civic participation changed during a period of growing income inequality  i find that since the 1970s  electoral participation decreased  volunteering increased  and social movement activity remained constant  participation varied by sociodemographic group  with highly educated whites most active in all activities  females volunteered more than males  but participated at the same rate in all other activities  the gap between male and female volunteering increased over the time period  as did the socioeconomic gap in volunteering  racial gaps in participation  however  remained relatively stable from 1976 to 2009  
 the class politics of prejudice  brexit and the land of no hope and glory the debates relating to social class and whether it is still a useful concept in describing a lived reality of the british population has never been far away from media  political and academic dispute  thatcher s britain throughout the 1980s attempted to dilute class meaning with what was called a home owning democracy  and thus end class collective politics through easily available credit for the working class while simultaneously attacking trade union organization  recruitment and political action  during the late 1990s and into the noughties a new labour  administration attempted to exacerbate the end of class politics through an agenda of a cultural distinction  to class identity  class struggle  class politics and class identity is embedded deep within the cultural norms practices  and history of british democracy  consequently it is difficult if not impossible to prise class inequality in the uk away from and out of national  local and personal politics  savage et al  2015  393 8   this paper focuses upon the sense that class politics  and cultural class distinction  within the uk had the biggest influence in determining a working class leave vote  in the 2016 referendum within the uk  this paper explores accounts and narratives from working class leave  voters though an ethnographic study of the political and social viewpoints of working class communities of east london  and of ex mining towns of nottinghamshire  framing into fuller context the anger and apathy of being left out   arguing that being left out  has been part of working class political narratives for over 30 years  going beyond frustration and apathy  a significant part of the narrative of working people was of not existing   suggesting certain important linkages with ongoing debates about new ways of conceptualizing class differences and class structures  
 the combination of life course and biographical research the case example of identity constructions in the life course the combination of life course and biographical research can only be done within the framework of mixed method approaches  as there is no established research program for this  good practice examples of existing projects in which methods have been combined have to be reflected  in this sense  this article discusses three case studies regarding the complementarity of life course and biographical perspectives and possible synergies emerging from the combination  the discussion is based on three sequential mixed methods projects investigating identity related questions  identity work and employment  family foundations and the construction of national belonging  four different forms of synergies can be analyzed  a  complementary understanding of process dynamics  b  complementary understanding of different types  c  complementarity to avoid one sided misinterpretations and to understand the role of ambivalences for the course of life  and d  expanded possibilities for the evaluation of theoretical models  finally  the position is justified that the combination of life course and biographical research doesn t have necessarily to be linked to a paradigmatic standpoint when setting up the study  qualitative and quantitative studies may be considered of equal importance without the necessity to decide which method is core and which is supplementary  
 the community reclaims control  learning experiences from rural broadband initiatives in the netherlands based on four illustrative case studies from the netherlands  this article discusses learning experiences gained from rural broadband initiatives  as an example of the big society   or participatiesamenleving  in dutch   initiatives try to step in where the market and the government fail  the main struggle seems to be negotiating between market and government interests  while simultaneously safeguarding local interests  many challenges and frustrations arise from counter tactics on the part of national market players  and governmentality inspired actions of regional and local authorities  local capacity   such as social  intellectual  and financial capital   proves to be crucial in negotiating external influences  but it is easily overburdened  case studies show that volunteer burnout is a risk that potentially has a high impact  despite neoliberal agendas and community led development schemes that promote citizen initiatives  it remains challenging for communities to reclaim control over their digital futures  members of the initiatives have to learn and professionalise in order to stand their ground in a competitive and complex broadband market  but this learning element seems to be only a by product of the process towards achieving the tangible result for rural development  that is  high speed broadband access  
 the company you keep  is socialising with higher status people bad for mental health  socialising with higher status individuals can be hypothesised to exert opposing influences on the mental health of the ego  on the one hand  socialising with higher status alters might enable individuals to access valuable resources  on the other hand  status discrepant friendships could be detrimental to mental health by engendering feelings of unfairness  we sought to examine the impact of status discrepant social relationships on depressive symptoms in the 2012 korean general social survey  kgss   a nationally representative sample  we show that socialising with higher status people is positively associated with depressive symptoms  there is no significant difference between those socialising with equivalent status or with lower status alters  perceived unfairness also increase depressive symptoms  respondents socialising with higher status alters tend to report greater depressive symptoms as their perceived unfairness increases  gender stratified analyses reveal that the detrimental impact of status discrepant relationships are observed for men only  not for women  these findings suggest that socialising with higher status people can be a net detriment for mental wellbeing by increasing stress frustration or decreasing psychological resources such as self esteem  and that these effects are more pronounced for individuals who perceive that society is unfair  this pattern appears stronger for men  which might be associated with gender roles internalised through gender socialisation processes  
 the comparative inclusive human development of globalisation in africa this study examines the impact of globalisation on inclusive human development in 51 african countries for the period 1996 2011 with particular emphasis on income levels  low income vs  middle income   legal origins  english common law vs  french civil law   resource wealth  oil rich vs  oil poor   landlockedness  landlocked vs  unlandlocked   religious domination  christianity vs  islam  and political stability  stable vs  unstable   the empirical evidence is based on instrumental variable panel fixed effects and tobit regressions in order to control for the unobserved heterogeneity and limited range in the dependent variable  political  economic  social and general globalisation variables are used  six main hypotheses are investigated  the findings broadly show that middle income  english common law  oil poor  unlandlocked  christian oriented and politically stable countries are associated with comparatively higher levels of globalisation driven inclusive human development  puzzling findings are elucidated and policy implications discussed  
 the complex relationship between mental health and social conditions in the lives of young australians mixing work and study poor mental health in youth has been consistently shown to be rising over the past 20 years  while it is well established that mental health status is associated with social conditions  population level perspectives make it difficult to identify the complex ways social and structural conditions impact on mental health  based on longitudinal  mixed method  data  this exploratory longitudinal study aims to study how the life circumstances of education  work and financial situation are related to mental health in young australians  aged 20 22   findings show that the combination of study  work and financial hardship can be regarded as a stressor contributing to poor mental health  particularly if experienced over several years  and that those in the middle socio economic bracket have the worst mental health outcomes  this research has implications for welfare policies and the responsibilities of educational institutions for the welfare of young people  
 the concept of a living tradition starting with popper  social theorists across the board have acknowledged that traditions serve socially valuable functions  however  while traditions are usually understood as living  entities that come in overlapping varieties and evolve over time  the socially valuable functions attributed to tradition tend to presuppose invariability in ways of thinking and acting  addressing this tension  this article provides a detailed analysis of the concept of tradition  and directs special attention to conceivable criteria for the authentic continuation of a tradition  it is argued that the ways of thinking and acting that constitute the material of a tradition must   among faithful members of that tradition   stand in a relation of equivalence   not identity or similarity  the implications of this account concern our ability to decide  normatively  conflicts over authenticity among rival tradition branches as well as the role that traditions play in policy making  
 the concept of spiritual power in east asian and canadian aboriginal thought a distinction is often made between animism  a belief that everything has a soul or spirit  and animatism  which refers to a belief in a generalized  impersonal power that permeates all of reality  although the distinction seems to be useful  most traditional societies probably include elements of both  some concepts  such as mana or kami  can be either animistic or animatistic  depending on whether one is focused on a specific object such as a sacred tree or on the essential oneness of the spiritual power that is found in everything  moreover  the distance between animism and animatism is not that great  from the recognition that everything in the cosmos has a soul  as in animism  it is only a small leap to the position of animatism that everything in the cosmos shares the same spiritual power  these theoretical points are illustrated with ethnographic information provided by the three authors of this article  
 the construction of anger in comments on the public behavior of members of the social elite in chile digital media is a platform of immediate presence that rests on a demediatized communication  it favors virtual collective action that allows digital citizens  in contexts of accentuated social inequality  to construe themselves as anti establishment  our research explores the co participative construction of an online shitstorm  in comments posted on websites generated to respond to power abuse and inequity in chilean society  the construction of citizens  anger in digital discourse will be analyzed in light of the postulates of systemic functional linguistics  sfl  and in the perspective of critical discourse analysis  cda   the corpus analyzed consists of 500 comments issued between april and july 2016 to contest a powerful chilean businessman who uploads a video to youtube to defend himself from the public verbal attacks of a congressman  the results of the analysis show representations related to corruption  power abuse and inequity from people who conceal in the economic power they have to assert they are ordinary citizens  
 the contentious politics of nationalism and the anti naturalization campaign in tunisia  1932 1933 this article asks how  when  and why people came to mobilize en masse in the name of the tunisian nation against french protectorate rule  rather than taking anti colonial nationalism as an inevitable response to the imposition of colonial rule  the account offered here insists that it is an outcome to be explained  building on more recent theoretical directions that stress the processual  relational  and eventful dynamics of nationalism  the article shows that nationalism and nationalist mobilization cannot be attributed simply to the workings of nationalist intellectuals  to long standing grievances  or to larger macro level transformations  rather  seeing nationalism as part of struggle and as a domain in which various forms of contentious politics are played out  i show how attention to a particular contentious event in the anti naturalization campaign can help us to understand how a certain version of the nation becomes salient as a mobilizing rubric for mass level mobilization and how various forms of contention coalesce to produce nationalist outcomes  
 the contribution from relationships with parents and teachers to the adolescent sense of coherence  do prosociality and hyperactivity inattention also play a significant role  sense of coherence  soc  is receiving increasing attention from a number of disciplines interested in the study of adolescent positive development  given the significant links between soc and well being  attention is now moving to the precursors of soc  the aim of this study was to analyze the contribution of relationships with parents and teachers  contextual factors  to young people s soc while taking into account the potential role of individual differences in prosociality and hyperactivity inattention  individual factors   the sample consisted of 2 979 adolescents aged 15 18 who had participated in the 2010 edition of the world health organization  who  survey health behaviour in school aged children   hbsc  in spain  data were collected by means of anonymous online questionnaires  and statistical analyses included factorial analysis of variance  anova  and analysis of covariance  ancova   both contextual and individual factors made significant contributions to the adolescents  soc  importantly  the significance of relationships with parents and teachers remained once prosociality and hyperactivity inattention were taken into account  
 the conundrum of kamaiya  ex bonded laborers  local leaders  and the construction of claims and profit in a nepalese squatter settlement the following article seeks to explain how the relocation of former bonded laborers  kamaiya  into a preexisting nepalese squatter settlement confounded conventional approaches used by local leaders in profiting from the controlled distribution of unregistered government land  i argue that while liberated bonded laborer populations provide an exceptional moral high ground from which to defend the use of land in the absence of legal tenure  the basis for their claims is not easily co opted and therefore creates liability for leaders  i suggest that this liability is related to the content and lack of equivocation in ex bonded laborer claims  the difficulties of constructing and utilizing claims to land associated with kamaiya are also linked to the complicated history of caste and ethnic relations informing the relationship between former bonded laborers and the higher castes that have historically dominated many regions of nepal and comprise much of the squatter settlement leadership  simultaneously providing legitimacy as well as liability  the liberated kamaiya were a conundrum in their new place of residence  
 the cost of well being it is by now common knowledge that in switching from gdp to alternative  multidimensional  measures of collective well being one can provide a better account of a country s socio economic conditions  such a gain  however  comes at the price of losing output to input type of link between well being and the resources necessary to make it available  since well being measures are not meant to be only an exercise in documentation  but also to inform policies and priorities  we propose a method to build a measure of well being in the form of a single index  as for gdp  which takes into account   1  the social and environmental costs  not considered in the gdp  and  2  the use of conventional resources  capital and labour   not considered in the currently available multidimensional measures of well being  we use a data envelopment analysis type of model  integrated with principal component analysis  to evaluate oecd countries  relative efficiency in providing well being  our results show that the costs of producing well being have a large and significant impact on the resulting index of well being  therefore  high efficiency in providing well being and high income cannot be considered a proxy to each other  in addition  it is shown that countries react differently to the different costs of well being  poor countries are  on average  more efficient in terms of conventional inputs  labour and capital   while rich countries have higher efficiency indices relative to social and environmental costs  the close to zero correlation between gdp and well being indices for rich countries provides new support to the  easterlin paradox   
 the creativity of everyday life in crafting resilient food systems  a framework and case from the atlantic forest coast of brazil we introduce everyday creativity as an approach to understanding the role of agency in resilience thinking and as a conceptual lens through which to view the ways that people respond to globalized change  our focus is on the use of biodiversity in crafting responses within food systems of rural and remote communities  we propose a conceptual framework to understand the flow of biological materials across five phases of a food system and how benefits map to actors  this allows us to locate disruptions that arise from globalized change and the factors that enable and constrain responses  we then present an application of the conceptual framework using a case study from the atlantic forest coast of brazil  that demonstrates that in a world characterized by globalized change our understanding of resilient food systems requires more analysis of the factors that limit everyday creativity at different phases of the food system  
 the crisis sequence  the case of secessionism in tuscaloosa county  alabama prevailing scholarly approaches to the u s  secession crisis suggest that the crisis reflected either the interests of slaveowners or mounting socioeconomic pressure in the electorate  both arguments suffer from empirical and analytical challenges  chief among these being that the southern whig party and its planter base actively resisted secession until the early 1850s  why did the largest slaveowners oppose disunion only to fold by 1861  drawing on beat level electoral returns  newspapers  and private correspondence from antebellum tuscaloosa county  alabama  i argue that the answer lies in conceiving of the prelude to secession as a crisis sequence  so named because it precipitates crises of hegemony  when no one political actor possesses the mass consent to rule and once salient social cleavages cease to resonate  such sequences destabilize the relationship between parties and their constituents and allow political allegiances to swing wildly from one party to the next  giving such sequences their nonlinear character  
 the decline and persistence of the old boy  private schools and elite recruitment 1897 to 2016 we draw on 120 years of biographical data  n   120 764  contained within who s whoa unique catalogue of the british elite to explore the changing relationship between elite schools and elite recruitment  we find that the propulsive power of britain s public schools has diminished significantly over time  this is driven in part by the wane of military and religious elites  and the rise of women in the labor force  however  the most dramatic declines followed key educational reforms that increased access to the credentials needed to access elite trajectories  while also standardizing and differentiating them  notwithstanding these changes  public schools remain extraordinarily powerful channels of elite formation  even today  the alumni of the nine clarendon schools are 94 times more likely to reach the british elite than are those who attended any other school  alumni of elite schools also retain a striking capacity to enter the elite even without passing through other prestigious institutions  such as oxford  cambridge  or private members clubs  our analysis not only points to the dogged persistence of the  old boy   but also underlines the theoretical importance of reviving and refining the study of elite recruitment  
 the demobilization of diaspora  history  memory and  latent identity  in the context of sustained interest in the mobilization of diasporic identities  i consider how and why diasporic identities might be demobilized over time  i use the case of an indian pakistani community in the uk and the usa  sometimes referred to as bihari   to examine how historical memories of conflict are narrated in diaspora and the impact this has on the presence or absence of diasporic consciousness   the significance of memory in diasporic and transnational communities has been neglected  especially where the narration of historical events is concerned  the impact of forgetting has received particularly scant attention  i argue that  in the absence of this story  important lessons about the role of history in the formation of community are obscured  in this example  the latent  identities created on diaspora s demobilization help us to unpick the dyadic relations of home  and away  at the heart of essentialist conceptualizations of the concept  
 the determinants of heroin flows in europe  a latent space approach this study utilises recent advances in statistical models for social networks to identify the factors shaping heroin trafficking in relation to european countries  first  it estimates the size of the heroin flows among a network of 61 countries  before subsequently using a latent space approach to model the presence of trafficking and the amount of heroin traded between any two given countries  many networks  such as trade networks  are intrinsically weighted  and ignoring edge weights results in a loss of relevant information  traditionally  the gravity model has been used to predict legal trade flows  assuming conditional independence among observations  more recently  latent space position models for social networks have been used to analyze legal trade among countries  and  mutatis mutandis  can be applied to the context of illegal trade to count both edge weights and conditional dependence among observations  these models allow for a better understanding of the generative processes and potential evolution of heroin trafficking routes  this study shows that geographical and social proximity provide fertile ground for the formation of heroin flows  opportunities are also a driver of drug flows towards countries where regulation of corruption is weak   c  2017 elsevier b v  all rights reserved  
 the difference law makes  domestic atrocity laws and human rights prosecutions this article offers the first systematic analysis of the effects of domestic atrocity laws on human rights prosecutions  scholars have identified various political and sociological factors to explain the striking rise in human rights prosecutions over the past 30 years  yet the role of domestic criminal law in enabling such prosecutions has largely been unexamined  that is surprising given that international legal prohibitions against human rights atrocities are designed to be enforced by domestic courts applying domestic criminal law  we argue that domestic criminal laws against genocide and crimes against humanity facilitate human rights prosecutions in post authoritarian states by helping to overcome formal legal roadblocks to prosecution  such as retroactivity  amnesties  immunities  and statutes of limitations  using original data on domestic atrocity laws and human rights prosecutions in new democracies  we find that atrocity laws increase the speed with which new democracies pursue prosecutions  as well as the overall numbers of trials they initiate and complete  
 the digitization of diaspora engagement  managing extraterritorial talent using the internet in this article  i examine how the government of the people s republic of china  prc  seeks to manage its skilled emigrants in the information age  i investigate the rationales  techniques and imageries underlying the use of the internet by the state  for the research  i used interviews  participant observation and documentary analysis to explore the case of london based chinese professionals and their contacts with the prc government  the findings demonstrate that two modes of internet use mainly manage these skilled emigrants  first  digitized diasporic associations play a key role in brokering the influences of the government among the diaspora  second  the prc government has set up websites to collect and manage information on skilled emigrants pertaining to their labour market potential  a nationalistic discourse of a caring and protective state of origin surround both governing practices  nevertheless  some emigrants resist these internet mediated governing practices  through distrust and a calculated rationality underscored by a neoliberal logic  
 the discouraged worker and suicide in the united states this paper empirically analyses whether worker discouragement is linked to suicide in the united states  this paper argues that discouraged workers might translate their frustration into alcohol or drug consumption rather than committing suicide directly  based on the linear granger causality test  this study finds that changes in the number female unemployed workers help to predict changes in female suicide patterns  a 1   increase in growth in the male unemployment rate with age  45 54  will lead to a 2 8   increase in the growth of male alcohol induced deaths  this study finds a nonlinear causality from the female unemployment with age  25 34  45 54  50 and over  to drug induced deaths  these findings suggest the importance of providing treatment for the jobless to reduce the risk for excessive alcohol consumption  drug misuse and suicidal behavior  
 the discursive production and maintenance of class privilege  permeable geographies  slippery rhetorics the underlying premise of this article is that the social meanings and cultural entanglements of the so called super rich or 1  reach far beyond any specific people or place  to be sure  the tightly managed  tailored spaces of super elites are often less exclusive than first meets the eye  and the markers of super elite status circulate in quite informal  banal ways  drawing on a combination of textual and fieldwork data  we map three interlocking semiotic landscapes  the luxury travel fair in london  the burj al arab hotel in dubai and then elite  signage and luxury  labelling from around the world  using this kind of discourse ethnographic evidence  the point we make is a simple but  we believe  important one  the geographies of eliteness are deliberately permeable just as its rhetorics are strategically slippery  indeed  the hegemonic power of contemporary class privilege lies precisely   albeit paradoxically   in a constantly maintained appearance of ubiquity  inclusivity and ordinariness  
 the diverse economies of online pornography  from paranoid readings to post capitalist futures anti pornography campaigners have frequently claimed that porn studies need to take the economics of pornography seriously  yet often this amounts to little more than the idea that pornography is a capitalist product  this article brings together j k gibson graham s work on post capitalism and eve sedgwick s notion of paranoid  and reparative  reading in order to think about the performative effects of the narratives we use to talk about the pornography industry  it proposes a move away from a capitalocentric understanding of online pornography towards a diverse economies  approach  one that demonstrates the multitude of ways in which pornography exists outside of the rubric of capitalism  this helps to avoid the affective state of paranoia and helplessness that narratives of the all powerful global porn industry so often create  whilst also allowing for a more nuanced understanding of the legal regulation of pornography  the article concludes with some thoughts as to how a diverse economies approach might better enable us to assess recent attempts to regulate online pornography within britain  noting attempts at regulation may have an adverse effect on not for profit  amateur  or peer to peer pornography  whilst benefiting mainstream corporate pornography producers  
 the dock on trial  courtroom design and the presumption of innocence this article examines the place of the criminal dock in courtroom design  challenges to the use of the dock have been based upon the inability of the defendants to hear effectively  to communicate with counsel  to maintain their dignity  and to benefit from the presumption of innocence  increasingly courts are incorporating secure docks  where defendants are partially or completely surrounded by glass  or in some countries  metal bars   to what extent do these changes and modifications undermine the right to the presumption of innocence  we present the results of an experimental mock jury study that was designed to test whether the placement of the accused influences jurors  perceptions  we find that jurors are more likely to convict defendants when they are located in a traditional dock or a secure dock  compared to sitting next to their counsel at the bar table  we conclude by discussing the implications for trial procedures  counsel communications  and courtroom design  
 the double stigma of limited literacy and mental illness  examining barriers to recovery and participation among public mental health service users the disadvantaged social position of public mental health service users reflects synergistic relationships among tangible disadvantage and stigma and its consequences  limited literacy  an important factor in social disadvantage and an additional source of stigma  is virtually absent from the discussion  employing a mixed methods  service user informed design  we explore the meaning and impact of limited literacy in the lives of public mental health service users in the united states  of 267 participants  184  69 percent  read at or below an eighth grade level  next  we demonstrate levels of and explore relationships among both literacy and mental illness concealment stigma and stigma consciousness  for mental illness   finally  informed by our qualitative data  we describe how people encounter and manage this double burden of stigma with respect to  contexts of concealment  dilemmas of disclosure  and reduction and exclusion  limited literacy and its associated stigma are important and underexamined barriers to mental health  well being  recovery  and social inclusion for public mental health service users  future work should include further examination of the multiple and layered stigmas in the lives of people with serious mental illness  
 the drama of the anthropocene  can deep ecology  romanticism  and renaissance science rebalance nature and culture  in the late 20th century  scientists began to warn the public that human activity had begun to change planetary systems  some have thus named the current geological epoch the anthropocene  a period in which humans are degrading natural systems  this damage occurs in part because we have not come to terms with the dual character of human naturebeing both inside and outside nature  
 the dynamic relations between economic conditions and anti immigrant sentiment  a natural experiment in times of the european economic crisis theories on intergroup relations suggest that negative attitudes toward immigrants tend to rise when economic conditions deteriorate  however  these arguments were mostly tested during times of economic prosperity in europe  we put this theoretical expectation to test by analyzing two rounds of the european social survey  ess  with data from 14 west european immigration countries before  2006  and after  2010  the peak of the european economic crisis  results show that anti immigrant sentiments increased in countries where perceptions of economic insecurity also increased  anti immigrant sentiments decreased in countries where perceptions of economic insecurity declined  in contrast  changes in objective economic conditions  i e  unemployment rates  during the same period of time did not display the expected effects in a similarly robust way  
 the educational gradient in self rated health in europe  does the doctor patient relationship make a difference  research suggests that doctor patient relations have evolved from a doctor centered  paternalistic approach towards a more patient centered  egalitarian model of interactions between physicians and their patients  given the long running debate on the positive relationship between education and health  the question arises how this development in doctor patient relations affects social inequalities in health  first  we test to what extent egalitarian  e g  discussing treatment decisions with patients  doctor patient relations are underlying the education self reported health association  second  we test whether egalitarian and paternalistic  e g  withholding some information from patients  doctor patient relations show differential effects on self reported health across educational groups  analyses of the european social survey  ess  2004 2005 for 24 countries demonstrate that a more egalitarian doctor patient relationship does not substantially reduce educational inequalities in self reported health  however  some direct positive effects of egalitarian and direct negative effects of paternalistic doctor patient relations on health ratings can be found  finally  results show how the health status of the lower educated can improve with a more egalitarian and less paternalistic doctor patient relationship  
 the effect of gender and relational distance on plaintiff decision making in the litigation process individuals  choices about whether to resolve disputes via litigation can be affected by their relationship with the potential defendant  i explore whether gender also plays a role  with women being less aggressive in legal tactics than men as their connection to the potential defendant becomes closer  the study uses a survey design with vignettes to explore decisions across the legal process  including the willingness to sue  responses to settlement offers  and whether or not to appeal  the survey varies the extent of the relationship between the potential plaintiff and defendant and includes two types of injuriesa slip and fall and pay discrimination  the findings reveal that once litigation has begun  women have a greater preference than men for mediation in both types of cases  but they are more resistant than men to settlement in discrimination disputes  neither men nor women s legal strategies seem to be affected by relational distance  
 the effect of paramilitary protest policing on protestors  trust in the police  the case of the  occupy israel  movement the use of paramilitary methods in civil policing tasks has become common in western police agencies  despite propositions that such methods should undermine the relationship between the police and the public  the effect of paramilitary policing on public trust in the police has not been empirically tested  in the present study  we examine this question in the context of protest policing  which has become a major concern for western police agencies  using a survey of 470 protesters who participated in occupy protest events in israel in 2012  we find that the perceived use of paramilitary methods has an independent and negative effect on trust  stronger than that of police effectiveness and the neutrality component of procedural justice  in depth interviews suggest that the significance of paramilitarism may be the result of a sense of alienation and criminalization it elicits among protesters who generally perceive themselves as law abiding citizens  
 the effect of social capital on health among european older adults  an instrumental variable approach one of the key policy question for an ageing population is the identifications of the factors which influence health  very recently  an increasing interest on social capital has developed and  surprisingly  not much is known for the european population  this study analyzes the effect of structural social capital on health  measured as self perceived health  of the individuals aged 60 or more residing in european countries  the sample comes from the fourth wave of the survey on health and retirement in europe  we use an instrumental variables approach in order to account for the reverse causality between social capital and health  we found that structural social capital exerts a positive effect preventing people to suffer of a poor self perceived effect  results are robust to different estimation methods  
 the effect of sociodemographic  mis match between interviewers and respondents on unit and item nonresponse in belgium interviewer characteristics affect nonresponse and measurement errors in face to face surveys  some studies have shown that mismatched sociodemographic characteristics for example gender affect people s behavior when interacting with an interviewer at the door and during the survey interview  resulting in more nonresponse  we investigate the effect of sociodemographic  mis matching on nonresponse in two successive rounds of the european social survey in belgium  as such  we replicate the analyses of the effect of  mis  matching gender and age on unit nonresponse on the one hand  and of gender  age and education level  mis matching on item nonresponse on the other hand  recurring effects of sociodemographic  mis match are found for both unit and item nonresponse   c  2017 elsevier inc  all rights reserved  
 the effects of changes to legal aid on lawyers  professional identity and behaviour in summary criminal cases  a case study this article explores the effects of changes to legally aided representation on criminal cases in magistrates  courts according to data collected in an area of south east england  i consider the political factors that motivated changes to legal aid and suggest how these issues affecting lawyers  understanding of their role  and how that understanding affects the relationships between defendants  lawyers  and the magistrates  courts  i argue that the research indicates a potential relation between solicitors  risk taking behaviour in obtaining funding and the reintroduction of means testing  remuneration rates affect the service that defendants receive and the reintroduction of means testing decreased efficiency in summary criminal courts  ultimately  i argue that changes to legal aid funding have increased lawyers  uncertainty about their role  leaving them torn between acting efficiently and providing a good level of service  
 the effects of visible customer characteristics on servers  perceptions of tipping  potential threats to service interactions this study examined the effects of customer race  i e   caucasian  african american  hispanic  and asian   gender  i e   female and male   and attire  i e   business and casual  on servers  tip expectations and service intentions  the results indicate that customers in business attire are perceived as better tippers and targeted for better treatment than customers in casual attire  however  this main effect of attire was qualified by significant interactions with race and gender  the positive effects of business  vs  casual  attire were greater for african americans than for caucasians and for males than for females  the implications of these findings for the training and monitoring of restaurant servers are discussed  
 the emergence of forensic doctors  naples  17th century en   the management of the medical emergency is assigned to the corporation of the barbers of naples  these practitioners integrate into first aid an examination aiming to identify the causes of the death and the weapon used against the injured  the intervention of the barbers during incidents disturbing public order confers them a significant role in their regulation  involving a cooperation with the judicial institutions  without an effective integration  the redaction of medical expertise is of competence of the physician  the gradual disappearance of the barbers in the 18th century and the development of surgery promote the union of forensic examination and expertise  
 the environmental performance  corporate social responsibility  and food safety of food companies from the perspective of green finance in recent years  there have been frequent instances of environmental pollution in the chinese food industry  and food safety incidents have aroused widespread concern  however  few empirical studies on the relationship among corporate environmental performance  corporate social responsibility  and food safety have been conducted  there is also a lack of targeted and effective interventions and solutions  to develop ways to resolve food safety issues  using the data from 77 listed food firms in china s shanghai and shenzhen a share exchange market during 2006 to 2016  the relationships among the environmental performance of food firms  corporate social responsibility  and food safety were empirically analyzed  and the ameliorating effects of green finance acting as the intervention variable on corporate social responsibility and food safety for food firms were explored  results show that the better the environmental performance of the food firm  the stronger the corporate social responsibility  furthermore  the stronger the corporate social responsibility and the better the environmental performance of the given firm  the less food safety incidents occur  additionally  there is a correlation between the environmental performance of food firms and food safety  this indicates that strengthening supervision of the environmental performance of food firms may reduce the frequency of food safety issues  the implementation of green finance policy can also directly enhance the food safety by improving the environmental performance of food firms  and directly improve the food safety situation by raising corporate social responsibility  this study provides a significantly reference for decision making with respect to strengthening internal controls on food safety in the food industry and to developing regulatory methods by food regulating authorities  
 the everyday risk work of dutch child healthcare professionals  inferring  safe  and  good  parenting through trust  as mediated by a lens of gender and class amidst intensifying policy concerns with children s wellbeing and development  healthcare professionals are required not only to assess risk of abuse and neglect  but to manage risk of poor parenting  more broadly  drawing on 15 in depth interviews and non participant observations of 61 professional family interactions  across four preventative public health services for children in the netherlands  we explored how professionals accomplished such risk work amid intractable uncertainties  building inferences from brief encounters with families  professionals gauged the extent to which they trusted parents to care appropriately   this trust developed most readily with parents experienced as familiar  by the largely middle class female professionals  harnessing schutzian phenomenology  we analyse the related manifestations of social structure within the interactional dynamics and lifeworlds of risk assessment  we argue that social structures of gender  class and ethnicity can be seen as influential both through the differing potential for we relationships  to be formed and via the generalising and stereotyped knowledge applied in their absence  
 the expansion and contraction of the journalistic field and american online citizen journalism  2000 2012 while previous research has considered patterns of homogeneity and heterogeneity in the journalistic field  existing literature has largely ignored the factors that contribute to the growth and contraction of the field  using citizen journalism  ct  as a case study  we examine how four forces organizational population dynamics  technological innovations  exogenous political events  and endogenous disruptions elsewhere in the field   shaped the growth of cj over time and  consequently  the journalistic field  using a snowball sampling method  we collected a  near population  of u s  based  english language cj sites  n   1829  to measure yearly density and rates of foundings and mortalities  the population of cj sites increased through most of the period  foundings declined after a spike in 2005  and mortalities rose dramatically after 2010  the results provide evidence that organizational population and technological change affected the size of the population of cj sites  while political upheaval and disruptions within professional journalism held less sway  
 the expansion of low cost  state subsidized childcare availability and mothers  return to work behaviour in east and west germany this study investigates whether increased availability of low cost  state subsidized childcare for under 3 year olds in germany is associated with shorter employment interruptions amongst mothers  by focusing on a major childcare reform in east and west germany  we examine the effect in two contexts that differ markedly in the acceptance and use of formal childcare and maternal employment  we combine rich longitudinal data from the german socio economic panel  2006 2014  with annual administrative county level data on the availability of low cost  state subsidized childcare  estimating event history models  the results indicate that increased childcare availability for under 3 year olds reduces mothers  employment interruptions  particularly after a second childbirth  and increases the probability of returning to part time or full time employment as opposed to marginal employment  furthermore  increased availability of low cost  state subsidized childcare increases mothers  likelihood of returning to employment in the second year after childbirth  when paid leave entitlements expire and the availability of childcare becomes important  however  our results are only statistically significant for west german mothers and only after the birth of a second child  the study extends the literature on women s return to work behaviour by providing evidence on the medium term impact of family policy on the duration of mothers  employment interruptions  
 the experience of material and emotional hardship in israel  do some groups cope better than others  while official poverty measures tend to focus on income alone  measures of material hardship also incorporate aspects of need  families experience material hardship when they have difficulty paying bills or buying things the household needs  such as food  medicine and medical care  the current study develops four measures of material and emotional hardship and focusses on two groups that have high risks of poverty in israel  namely israeli palestinians and ultra orthodox jews haredim  and compares them with the non haredi jewish majority  comparing israeli palestinians  haredim and non haredi jews provides an opportunity to study the intersection of poverty and group membership  group membership may affect hardship because groups differ in living conditions  poverty histories  social networks  access to resources  and perceptions of needs  the study draws on israel s 2013 social survey  conducted by israel s central bureau of statistics  n   7438   the findings point to substantial degrees of inequality among the disadvantaged  although haredim and palestinians have similar levels of income poverty  the study shows that the consequences of low income in terms of deprivation and hardship are more severe among israeli palestinians than among  haredi and non haredi  jews  israeli palestinians experience higher levels of material and emotional hardship than haredim after controlling for household income  
 the fifth frame of colorblind ideology  maintaining the comforts of colorblindness in the context of white fragility in the context of newly emerging racial backlash with implications for colorblind ideology  the authors explore understandings of race and racism among white students at historically black colleges and universities  hbcus   they build on bonilla silva s four frames of colorblind ideology and describe a fifth the disconnected power analysis frame  interviews with 18 white students across three hbcus revealed that this frame allows students with a limited but growing awareness of racial inequality to more strategically engage with and benefit from an environment where race is salient  while preserving white privilege in the process  the findings underscore the enduring significance of colorblind frames and the need for continued vigilance in naming covert race coded language that perpetuates white supremacy  
 the formation of spatial and symbolic boundaries among vietnamese diasporic skilled return migrants in ho chi minh city  vietnam more than 40 years since the end of the vietnam war  a younger generation of vietnamese americans is returning to their parents  ancestral homeland with career opportunities tied to vietnam s economic growth in the past decade  these more permanent return migrations reveal strategies of local and global assertions of belonging and identity management among the  1 5  and second generation of vietnamese americans who work in high skilled professions in their parents  ancestral homeland  known there as the viet kieu  overseas vietnamese   those who work in both corporate and nongovernmental organizations draw upon multiple forms of social and cultural capital to negotiate a third space between the local and global in westernizing pockets of ho chi minh city  vietnam  i argue that viet kieu constructed symbolic boundaries to distinguish themselves from foreigners and ethno national boundaries to distinguish themselves from locals  but they also crossed these boundaries to find spaces of belonging in vietnam  the experiences of this niche subgroup of more skilled viet kieu constitute transnational instances of active ethnic and national identity renegotiation that reaffirmed the importance of place making and subjective claims to an imagined authentic return experience  this study focused on highly skilled returnees  aiming to analyze how transnational flows of capital such as language  education  and access played into the symbolic boundary making and identity politics of return  
 the future of memory reaction to david rieff s book is bound to be mixed  its particulars are brilliant  its flaws  profuse  in praise of forgetting is misleadingly titled  for rieff focuses primarily on the social functions of memory and its relation to history and forgetfulness  in his view  every event and person  no matter how notable today  will be ultimately forgotten  but in the short run  forgetfulness is benign  leading to reconciliation and peace  memory  in contrast  is always malignant and distorted  yet so influential as to merge with and erode history  rieff s assertions are matched against the cases he himself adduces  cases which he describes selectively and with minimal regard for evidence  however tendentious his arguments  the insights and vast erudition to which david rieff treats his readers are undeniable  
 the gas that fuels the engine  individuals  motivations for medicalisation it is well established that the drivers of medicalisation have shifted alongside changes in the institution of medicine  the process of medicalisation is no longer incited by macro processes of institutional prestige or control  rather  individual patients consumers are pushing the process forward  the present study complicates this neat transition and examines the relationship between structure and agency using the case of assisted reproductive technology  art   specifically the medicalisation of lesbian reproduction in the us  i explore individuals  influence on and motivations towards medicalisation through 24 in depth interviews with women in same sex relationships who had ever attempted to become pregnant  in centring on their experiences  i find that while individual consumers may now propel medicalisation forward  oftentimes consumers  motivations for doing so reside in the prestige and control of medicine  in other words  consumers now seek medicalisation precisely because of the process s previous institutional drivers  in exploring what fuels the engine of medicalisation  the findings reveal its nuance and complexity  
 the global development of contemporary anti human trafficking advocacy efforts to combat human trafficking have grown in the last few decades  with states  international governmental organizations  igos   and nongovernmental organizations  ngos  working around the world to address the trade of people under conditions of force  fraud or deception for the purpose of exploitation  how has contemporary anti trafficking advocacy developed globally and why  competing approaches in global and transnational sociology   world polity and coercion  perspectives   offer different explanations  with the first focusing on culture and the second focusing on political and economic power  using data on 1861 anti trafficking ngos worldwide as well as secondary sources to qualitatively analyze the historical development of contemporary anti trafficking advocacy as a case study  this article demonstrates a more complicated process than either perspective predicts  what is needed is an approach that considers political  economic  and cultural forces involved in globalizing movements and that avoids a priori assumptions about the operations of power and the relations of the organizational actors  
 the globalization of production and income inequality in rich democracies despite prominent and compelling theoretical arguments linking manufacturing imports from the global south to rising income inequality in the global north  the literature has produced decidedly mixed support for such arguments  we explain this mixed support by introducing intervening processes at the global and national levels  at the global level  evolving characteristics of global production networks  gpns  amplify the effect of southern imports  at the national level  wage coordination and welfare state generosity counteract the mechanisms by which southern imports increase inequality  and thereby mitigate their effects  we conduct a time series cross section regression analyses of income inequality among eighteen advanced capitalist countries to test these propositions  our analysis addresses alternative explanations  as well as validity threats related to model specification  sample composition  and measurement  we find substantial variation in the effect of southern imports across global and national contexts  southern imports have no systematic effect on income inequality until the magnitude of gpn activity surpasses its world historical average  or in states with above average levels of wage coordination and welfare state generosity  with counterfactual analyses  we show that southern imports would have led to much different inequality trajectories in the north if there were fewer gpns  and if the prevailing degrees of wage coordination and welfare state generosity were higher  the countervailing effects of gpns and institutional context call for theories of inequality at the intersection of the global and the national  and raise important questions about distributional politics in the years to come  
 the government of migrant mobs  temporary divisible multiplicities in border zones this article engages with the production and government of migrant multiplicities in border zones of europe  arguing that the specificity of migrant multiplicities consists in their temporary and divisible character  it is argued that there are three different forms of migrant multiplicities   1  the multiplicity produced due to migrants  spatial proximity   2  the virtual multiplicity generated through data  and  3  the visualized and narrated multiplicity that emerges from media portraits of the spectacle  of the arrivals of migrants  it is claimed that multiplicities are made to divide and partition the migrants and thus prevent the formation of a collective political subject  in the concluding section  the article deals with the ambivalent character of the term the mob   addressing the twofold dimension of migrant multiplicities  these are in fact generated by techniques of power  at the same time exceeding them and representing potential emerging political subjects  
 the heteronomy among inuit of canada s north   the power that we do not know from oral sources collected in the contemporary period  this article re examines several major categories of inuit thought  taking into account their transformation following christianization  in the 20th century  the inuit have changed many of their practices  whereas at another level   that of schemes   the idea of a heteronomous order has remained more stable  in both contexts of shamanism and christianity  powers circulate through mediators  the modern idea of being able to produce its own laws  to base society on the full autonomy of actors without ever taking into account the great spiritual forces of the universe  has never been accepted  the inuit still consider that they belong to a world that is both unstable and relational  where other beings  such as animals  deceased and spirits or non human beings  interact  so that humans cannot change the course of events alone  two questions arise  to what extent has christianity affected heteronomy and increased the mysterious part of inuit animism  can sila  an encompassing spiritual force  be conceived as an inuit mana   resume partir de sources orales recueillies a la periode contemporaine  cet article reexamine plusieurs grandes categories de la pensee inuit en tenant compte de leur transformation suite a la christianisation  au 20eme siecle  les inuit ont en effet modifie un grand nombre de leurs pratiques alors que sur le plan des schemes  l idee d un ordre du monde heteronome et de pouvoirs qui circulent a travers des mediateurs est demeure plus stable  l idee moderne d etre en mesure de se donner ses propres lois  de fonder la societe sur la pleine autonomie des acteurs sans jamais tenir compte des grandes forces spirituelles de l univers  n a jamais ete acceptee  les inuit pensent plutot appartenir a un monde a la fois instable et relationnel  ou d autres existants que sont les animaux  les defunts et les esprits interagissent  si bien que les humains ne peuvent pretendre seuls inflechir le cours des choses  deux questions se posent alors   dans quelle mesure le christianisme a t il affecte l heteronomie et augmente la part mysterieuse de l animisme inuit   sila  cette force englobante  peut elle etre concue encore comme un    mana inuit      
 the history of sociology in the light of the kolner zeitschrift fur soziologie und sozialpsychologie  kzfss  cologne journal for sociology and social psychology  ever since its foundation the kolner zeitschrift fur soziologie und sozialpsychologie  kzfss  has belonged to the seminal sociological journals in the german speaking countries  numerous contributions to the kzfss had a significant impact on debates  controversies  and the course of german sociology or reflected fundamental disciplinary debates and social developments  based on selected articles from the kzfss the crucial points of the sociology in germany will be discussed and looks will be given into the changes of social criticism  
 the hunting industry  exploring the marriage of consumerism  sport hunting  and commercial entertainment this article makes a case for the inclusion of sport hunting in studies of consumer culture  this argument is advanced through an analysis of the hunting industry in north america  the hunting industry comprises a vast commercial network  exemplified by specialty retailers and advertiser supported media involved in the marketing of hunting related merchandise  the analysis contrasts environmental and cultural conservation  on the one hand  with consumerism and commercial media  on the other  these themes are situated historically and theoretically and then examined empirically by focusing on cable television channels devoted to hunting and on cabela s  an international retail chain that sells branded hunting and fishing equipment and sponsors media productions  based on consideration of these venues  including a description of cabela s stores  which are renowned for their size and spectacular attractions  it is argued that a commercial industry built around hunting manifests contradictions between conservationism and consumerism  connections between hunting culture and other aspects of consumer culture   such as food systems  environmental concerns  self reliance  and authenticity   are also elaborated  
 the impact and network embeddedness of the kolner zeitschrift fur soziologie und sozialpsychologie  kzfss  in its international interdisciplinary and multilingual outreach and receptiveness this article describes the reception and bibliographic embeddedness of the kolner zeitschrift fur soziologie und sozialpsychologie  kzfss  in comparison to the leading german sociological journals over the past 40 years  we provide citation and network analyses based on the web of science  the kzfss and the zeitschrift fur soziologie are the two leading sociological journals in the german sociological community  geospatial network analyses show that contributions in the kzfss are frequently perceived by researchers outside of german speaking countries  and discussions in international journals are picked up in the kzfss  among the german journals  the kzfss has an exclusive role  the journal receives citations from many german universities  but the distribution of citations from the kzfss to universities is much more selective and therefore skewed  the kzfss is well embedded in the international sociological discussion  it can be shown that the discussions in the kzfss are dominated by  international topics  and that these topics are more often picked up by the kzfss than set by it  overall  the kzfss is strongly rooted in the sociological discipline  which makes it a central outlet for sociological research in germany  
 the impact of construction and gentrification on an outdoor trans sex work environment  violence  displacement and policing the objective of this study was to investigate how environmental and structural changes to a trans outdoor work environment impacted sex workers in vancouver  canada  the issue of changes to the work area arose during qualitative interviews with 33 trans sex workers  in response  ethnographic walks that incorporated photography were undertaken with trans sex workers  changes to the work environment were found to increase vulnerabilities to client violence  displace trans sex workers  and affect policing practices  within a criminalized context  construction and gentrification enhanced vulnerabilities to violence and harassment from police and residents  
 the impact of deployment on children from canadian military families children in military families experience various stressors associated with the demands of military life  such as parental absences due to deployments  however  there is a limited understanding of children s well being to parental deployment from canadian military families  this study was conducted to examine the impact of deployment on the well being of school age children from canadian armed forces families and to consider the resilience factors in their well being  focus groups with children  n   85  showed that deployment negatively impacted children s well being  routines  and family dynamics  active distraction and social support seeking served as the most effective protective factors against deployment stress  recommendations for mitigating the impact of deployment are offered  
 the impact of mutual obligation for sole parents mutual obligation is located within a neoliberal socio political framework of policies designed to structure an ordered and disciplined society  emphasising strong work ethics and self reliance  this article presents findings of three qualitative studies into welfare recipient experiences under interventions allied to mutual obligation  the studies were of 14  2000   32  2007  and 15  2014 15  sole mothers in receipt of centrelink payments  participants voiced concerns over interventions targeting individuals predominantly already contributing in essential roles  fear of misdirected coercive punishments  increased stigmatisation  a lower real standard of living and unimproved prospects for suitable employment  the article explores past and present rhetoric and implementations of mutual obligation policies  and their impacts for people receiving welfare benefits  ongoing critical analysis of such interventionist policies is essential to ensuring that the ostensible goals of addressing poverty and disadvantage are achievable and without excessive unforeseen consequences to society  are they in the interests of social justice and stability  
 the independent s edge in an illegal drug distribution setting  levitt and venkatesh revisited popular imagery and scholarly research have differed significantly in their perceptions and understanding of the structure and scope of organized crime and gang settings  while the common image is that of the corporate like or formal criminal organization  past research has been more likely to argue and demonstrate in favour of market and network flexibility  in this study  we pursue this latter line of inquiry by demonstrating the market and network features that shape illegal drug distribution settings  in doing so  we rely on the quebec hells angels accounting books for a one year period  which brings us within the same empirical domain as levitt and venkatesh s  2000  study of the black knights in 1990s chicago  our study sways from the main premise that oriented the black knight s case study namely that performance within the illegal drug distribution structure was directly tied to that organization s rigid hierarchical structure  while the hells angels can be analyzed as a corporation  this does not mean that hells angels members are  by definition  at an advantage because of their organizational status in the illegal drug distribution setting in which some members are active  what our findings indicate is that a participant s ability to adapt to market dynamics and take on a core network position within an illegal drug market  cocaine  in this study  matter most  overall  we demonstrate that  1  quebec s cocaine market was structured primarily around traditional market forces  2  the transaction network around the hells angels was not centralized around a single person or small group of people  3  hells angels members were not the most active participants  and 4  being a hells angels member did not increase one s volume of transactions within the network quite differently  core network positioning did   c  2017 elsevier b v  all rights reserved  
 the influence of the human rights to water and sanitation normative content in measuring the level of service human rights to water and sanitation  hrws  have been consolidated as relevant frameworks to measure different levels of services  it is essential to move forward with specific initiatives that interpret the content of these human rights and operationalize them through specific metrics  however  some critical issues emerge in attempting this  different approaches are proposed in this article to tackle this challenge   1  utilizing a participatory technique to discuss the relative importance of the normative criteria to define water and sanitation services   2  defining a short list of key indicators to measure the different dimensions of hrws  and  3  assessing the impact of different weighting systems in the constructing an aggregated index  which has been proposed as a useful tool to monitor water  sanitation  and hygiene  wash  from a rights perspective  two municipalities  in mozambique and nicaragua  were selected as initial case studies  the results suggest that there is a common understanding among the experts about prioritization of the hrws criteria  differences in the relative importance given to the hrws criteria can be explained due to the particularities of the local context  further  the research suggests that expert opinions may be partially conditioned by targets and indicators proposed at the international level  although the influence of weighting techniques on aggregated measures and their utilization in the decision making process are limited  this methodology has a great potential for adapting specific wash metrics to different regional  national  and or local contexts taking into account the hrws normative content  
 the institutional foundations of medicalization  a cross national analysis of mental health and unemployment in this study  we question  1  whether the relationship between unemployment and mental healthcare use  controlling for mental health status  varies across european countries and  2  whether these differences are patterned by a combination of unemployment and healthcare generosity  we hypothesize that medicalization of unemployment is stronger in countries where a low level of unemployment generosity is combined with a high level of healthcare generosity  a subsample of 36 306 working age respondents from rounds 64 4  2005 2006  and 73 2  2010  of the cross national survey eurobarometer was used  country specific logistic regression and multilevel analyses  controlling for public disability spending  changes in government spending  economic capacity  and unemployment rate  were performed  we find that unemployment is medicalized  at least to some degree  in the majority of the 24 nations surveyed  moreover  the medicalization of unemployment varies substantially across countries  corresponding to the combination of the level of unemployment and of healthcare generosity  
 the integration of qualitative and quantitative research   theoretical foundations of  mixed methods  mixed methods have been used in social research for quite a long time  as can be seen by looking on influential empirical studies from the first half of the 20 th  century  where the combined use of qualitative and quantitative methods was justified in most cases only pragmatically  if at all   unfortunately  the discussions led from the 1970s onwards about theoretical justifications of mixed methods designs often suffered from a focus limited on formal and epistemological issues  this holds true for the debates about the notion of  triangulation  as well as for the controversies about the paradigms presumably underlying quantitative  qualitative or mixed methods research  by contrasting  positivism    constructivism  and  pragmatism  outdated frontlines were often preserved and complex philosophical problems oversimplified  furthermore  the focus on epistemology led to a neglect of substantial issues relating to the research field  which are always critical for the use of methods   the necessity for using  and combining  quantitative and qualitative methods follows from the nature of social structures relevant for the concrete field of investigation which may differ widely according to their stability and flexibility  thereby structures with limited scope or  contingent structures  create specific problems for qualitative and quantitative methods which can be detected and dealt with by drawing on the strengths of the respective other methodological tradition in mixed methods designs  
 the intensification of work in spain  2007 2011   teamwork and flexibility in this article  we analyse the relationship between the intensification of work and organizational flexibility  specifically  we focus on teamwork  considered as an emblematic organizational strategy of flexible and efficient organizations  the relationship between teamwork  intensity of work and stress is examined using data from spain s national survey on working conditions  based on the results  we propose that analysis of the intensity of work be incorporated into social dialogue and the prevention of occupational risks  
 the intergenerational effect and second childbirth  survey findings from the shaanxi province of china traditionally  the fertility behaviors of chinese people have been deeply influenced by the entrenched patriarchal  patrilineal  and patrilocal systems  women s fertility decisions and behaviors are significantly influenced by their parents and parents in law  given the current social changes with low fertility levels and intentions in china  it is still unclear about the actual link between the fertility behavior and the intergenerational effect  therefore  we utilize data from 1577 questionnaires  conducted in 2013 in the shaanxi province of northwest china about fertility intentions and behaviors  and use the event history analysis method and the cox proportional hazard model to explore the association between intergenerational effects and women s second childbirths   the number of the parental generation s children  and  the living arrangements of the parental generation  are employed to measure the intergenerational effect  the findings show that there is an existence of intergenerational transmission of fertility between women of childbearing age and their parents in law  rather than their biological parents when considering the effects of their parents in law  in addition  the study finds a significant correlation between women s second childbirth and the living arrangements of their parents in law  but no significant association with the living arrangements of their biological parents  these results support that the patriarchal  patrilineal  and patrilocal systems play a role in women s fertility behaviors in contemporary china  
 the interplay between equity and gender ideology in perceived housework fairness  evidence from an experimental vignette design previous survey studies on the perceived fairness of the division of housework have suffered from limitations resulting from the use of observational data  namely reverse causation  unobserved heterogeneity  and the difficulty of estimating more than one causal effect at once  this article overcomes these limitations by using an innovative method in this research field  a survey based vignette design combining the benefits of experiments with a higher capability of generalization  from our findings based on italian primary data  we argue that equity and gender ideology theories explain different elements of the fairness evaluation process and are not mutually exclusive  consistent with equity theory  under certain conditions it is considered fair to exchange paid and unpaid time  however  unlike equity theory  the economic value of time is not an issue  moreover  a request to renegotiate housework is more legitimate if it redresses a prior inequity and  for women  irrespective of the asker s gender  gender ideology affects partners  equity considerations  weighting their contribution to paid and unpaid work differently  
 the jury as a translation of democratic participation and political conflict in this response to valerie hans s presidential address  i use her legal translating term to argue that the implementation of liberal democratic structures in new democracies opens new opportunities to translate the jury system into and onto new democratic societies  while policy makers have concerns about the strength and vibrancy of lay participation in the legal system  policy makers  decisions to adopt trial by jury are not always democratic  nonetheless  the consequence of the translation of trial by jury furthers democratic development  using nicaragua  mexico  and russia as case studies  i suggest that one goal of policy makers who attempt to adopt trial by jury is to reduce the discretionary power of judges who remain from the prior government  comparative trial by jury research can contribute more to our understanding of democratic development than prior research has indicated  
 the lasting effect of intergenerational wealth transfers  human capital  family formation  and wealth recent evidence indicates that inheritances and other intergenerational wealth transfers have only a limited effect on wealth inequality and the intergenerational transmission of financial well being  in this study  we explore the role that human capital and family formation play in mediating the relationship between receiving a transfer and building wealth  we examine how educational attainment and family formation determine whether or not households are able to convert inheritances into greater assets  facilitating improved wealth accumulation  using data from the panel study for income dynamics  psid   we examine how these factors moderate wealth accumulation trajectories following a bequest or inter vivos gift  results reveal that educational attainment and marriage each facilitate wealth accumulation following a transfer  our evidence suggests that cumulative advantage processes produce divergent wealth accumulation trajectories but these are situated in important turning points in the life course   c  2017 elsevier inc  all rights reserved  
 the lived religion approach in the sociology of religion and its implications for secular feminist analyses of religion the sociological  lived religion  approach focuses on the experiences of religious individuals in everyday life  whilst also considering the institutional aspects of religion that they may engage with  it emphasizes that individuals do not simply  copy  institutional religious prescriptions  instead  it posits that people have an active and reflexive role in shaping  negotiating and changing their own beliefs and practices  this article examines the implications of the  lived religion  approach for secular feminist analyses of religion in western contexts  it starts out by proposing three different secular feminist positions on religion  a hard  a mixed hard and soft  and a soft position  the article then examines the views on women and religion forwarded by some high profile feminist organisations in europe  and how these relate to the three proposed secular feminist positions on religion  finally  the article assesses which secular feminist position is most compatible with a  lived religion  approach  
 the long term consequences of family class origins in urban china the chinese government redistributed houses  land and wealth across families and assigned an inheritable class identity  chengfen  to each family in early 1950s  the government then implemented class based discriminatory policies against the rich and middle class until 1978  this paper shows that individuals born after 1951 with rich class origins have significantly higher income and family assets per capita than those from the poor class in 2002  moreover  those who were born after 1960 from rich class gained more years of education than others except for the descendants of the revolutionary class  after the abolition of the discrimination policy  overall  the study provides evidence that intergenerational transmission of wealth status and education are not necessary flowing through the inheritance of physical capital  the paper further demonstrates that individuals with revolutionary background do not have lower economic outcome or educational attainment than those from the rich  suggesting that a new elite group emerges in contemporary china  
 the maintenance of untenable values  an ethnographic study of group level strategies to manage conflict this study examines how members of a group rife with contradiction manage the friction or tension that results from persistent violations of expectations for values and behaviors  through ethnographic observation  i find that local practices impact processes of tension creation and reduction  local cultural practices   including the use of both material and nonmaterial cultural elements   of managing friction within groups have been so thoroughly woven into the routine behaviors of the group that these practices enable members to continue membership and participation in the group despite frequent dissonant or conflictual experiences  i propose the concept of routinized management to describe this phenomenon  by elaborating fine s sociology of the local  i offer a theoretical account of both the micro  and mesolevel processes that facilitate the maintenance of untenable values in the field  
 the managed heart revisited  exploring the effect of institutional norms on the emotional labor of flight attendants post 9 11 this article examines the emotional culture of flight attendants thirty two years after hochschild s  1983  study  the managed heart  using data collected by participant observation and informal interviews  we argue that flight attendants are empowered by post 9 11 institutional changes in security policies and as a result are using more discretion in how they perform courteous emotional labor  we put forward two interrelated concepts the  9 11 effect  and  role shields  to explain how a new emphasis on safety over courtesy in institutional policies provides cabin crew with a normative resource to achieve greater autonomy  we establish that flight attendants are now more assertive when they interact with passengers  by acknowledging the flight attendant s post 9 11 experience and their increase in what we label emotional agency  this study offers a historical comparative complement to hochschild s emphasis on emotive constraints  
 the many layers of local  proximity and market influence on news coverage of the deepwater horizon oil spill objective  on april 20  2010  the deepwater horizon oil drilling rig exploded in the gulf of mexico  resulting in the death of 11 oil rig workers and a sea floor oil gusher releasing over 4 9 million barrels of oil into the gulf  the objective in this article is to shed light on the local media environment surrounding the spill  comparing local television news coverage among the five states most directly affected by the disaster  method  in our method  we conduct a content analysis of news coverage in various gulf media markets  result  in line with previous research  our results indicate that proximity matters in terms of story volume  prominence  and tone  our results also contribute to the literature by demonstrating significant variation across gulf markets depending on local economic considerations  conclusion  we contend this finding is important given how frames in coverage of disasters influence public opinion  political behavior  and the degree to which citizens are able to hold governments accountable  
 the material intensity of growth  implications from the human scale of production contemporary empirical studies on the resource intensity of the economic process provide evidence of a gradual de linking between natural resources use and economic growth  resource intensity is evaluated through the domestic material consumption gross domestic product  dmc gdp  ratio  defined as the material intensity index  trajectories of this ratio support the optimistic view that economic output is becoming progressively less dependent on resource flows  hence gdp is gradually dematerialized  the present study asserts that the dmc gdp indicator fails to take into account the biophysical properties of the production process which define the resource requirements of the economy  the present study proposes the  resources required for producing one unit of gdp per capita  income    as an alternative indicator for evaluating the resource requirements of the economy  the resource requirement  evaluated at the level of income  approximates the human scale of production  goods should embody certain biophysical properties in order to satisfy human needs  the trajectories of dmc income index for global growth rejects the vision of a dematerialized growth and the de linkage of the economy from natural resources  
 the measure matters  an investigation of evaluative and experience based measures of wellbeing in time use data measures of subjective wellbeing  swb  are used to understand how people think and feel about their lives and experiences  but the measure used matters to conclusions about how well people s lives are going  this research compares life evaluations and experienced swb using nationally representative time use diaries  advancing previous research because diaries are less subject to recall biases than other  more popular methods  analyses of over 20 000 us residents in 2012 2013 show life evaluations are more closely associated with positive and negative affect than experienced meaningfulness  women have higher swb than men except for negative affect  older age groups have higher swb than middle age groups except for experienced meaningfulness  and younger age groups report the lowest experienced meaning  the unemployed have low life evaluations but experiences of swb are similar across employment groups  a complete picture of swb requires a complete set of measures  
 the mendacity of reconciliation in an age of resentment the political ideal of reconciliation has gained increased prominence in recent decades  in part due to political experiments such as the south african truth and reconciliation commission and other formal or informal truth or reconciliation processes  here  i argue that there is a fundamental mendacity to reconciliation  given stubborn asymmetries of social power and disrespect  reconciliation as an ideal carries an impetus towards resolution that covers over the necessary role that conflict plays in political strugglesincluding the role that conflict plays within struggles for reconciliation  nevertheless  despite the mendacity of reconciliation  its meaning still holds political value  reconciliation implies an orientation towards social repair  which even the strongest critics of reconciliation cannot bring themselves to reject  some lies are worse than others  and some lies might be noble or necessary  reconciliation is the lattera fiction that is less pernicious than its absence  in this light  the task is to locate means of political reconciliation that do not obscure the conflicts and asymmetries of social life but enable social actors to face up to these conflicts and to discover novel ways to repair the damage that they can do  
 the military role in filling the security gap after armed conflict  three cases during stabilization operations  the host nation and the international community are often confronted with a security gap  which could be a prelude to an explosive growth of crime and public disorder  in the absence of a functioning local police  an alternative is that the  international  military temporarily intervenes as interim police  this article analyzes how the netherlands  military performed during security gaps in three  post conflict areas  bosnia and herzegovina  kosovo  and iraq  it concludes that army units frequently were involved in interim policing and de facto operated as hybrid organizations  without leaving the military paradigm behind  policing is generally not seen as a primary task of the military  however  to adapt to the reality of security gaps and to increase the operational effectiveness in the field of public security  the military would benefit from reflecting on their current military paradigm and on what they could learn from current policing practices  
 the moral construction of worry about radiation exposure  emotion  knowledge  and tests in the analysis of video recordings of the interactions between a doctor and the examinees following internal radiation exposure tests at a hospital in fukushima prefecture  i explore how the participants address one of the most serious consequences of the fukushima disaster  that is  their concerns about radioactive materials  to do so  this study employs conversation analysis  the doctor s presentation of the test results provides the examinees with a place to express relief and also makes relevant the justification work related to the expression of relief  in conclusion  i consider how the internal exposure tests also function as a communication tool in the context in which residents from affected areas face potential difficulties in expressing their worry about radiation  
 the multidimensional politics of inequality  taking stock of identity politics in the us presidential election of 2016 many democrats hoped that a particular kind of identity politics   women s   would help hillary clinton win the white house  in the aftermath of the election  some commentators bemoaned the fact that a majority of white women had voted for trump  and called it a kind of betrayal  underlining their expectation that women would naturally  on the basis of their gender identity  support a woman with women friendly politics  indeed  this kind of thinking about identity politics has been widespread with reference to a number of demographic groups  meanwhile  identity politics is lamented from the right and left by those who favour a greater emphasis on class based inequalities  or a greater national identity  some of whom blame identity politics for spawning or justifying a backlash of right leaning populism in the us  we argue for a turn to a more robust definition of identity as multidimensional and politically mediated for understanding political alignments over the past several decades  the multidimensionality of inequality   intersectionality or complex inequality   is widely accepted in the study of gender and race across the social science disciplines but has yet to be as successfully integrated into studies of electoral politics  thinking about women s positioning in systems of complex inequality  and how the political parties have or have not articulated the concerns of different groups of women  helps us to understand the 2016 election  as well as past and potentially future political developments  
 the network dynamics of co offending careers despite the long standing acknowledgement that crime is a group phenomenon  little research treats co offending as a dynamic network process  this study analyses the individual and network processes responsible for long lasting criminal relationships using co offendingdyads from eight years of arrest records in chicago  results from proportional hazard models suggest that homophily with respect to age  race  gender  geographic proximity  and gang identity lead to sustained partnerships  victimization increases the probability of continued co offending  while the victimization of one s associates dissuade continued collaboration  supra dyadic processes  centrality  transitivity  influence the likelihood of continued co offending  results are discussed regarding opportunities and turning points   c  2017 elsevier b v  all rights reserved  
 the network dynamics of status  assimilation and selection using longitudinal data that we have collected on friendship and advice relations in a cohort of mba students  we examine how status affects the dynamics of network ties among peers  estimates of stochastic actor oriented models  saoms  suggest that status is a consequence of network ties because over time the level of status attributed to individual students by other students tends to the average level of status attributed to their network partners a phenomenon we call status assimilation  status is also an antecedent to network ties because it affects partner selection decisions  giving rise to distinct forms of social attachment  we find that both network based processes of status assimilation  as well as status based processes of social selection  are present  but they vary subtly yet significantly across network domains  students tend to the average level of status of their friends  but not to that of their advisors  high status students are more active in the friendship network  but more popular in the advice network  we find evidence of performance homophily rather than status homophily  students with similar grades are more likely to exchange friendship and advice ties  high status students tend to be more central in the advice network  but status attributions spill over through friendship  rather than advice relations  the study documents how the relation between social status and social networks varies both over time  as well as across network domains  the study also demonstrates the importance of accounting for multiplexity the tendency of a network to operate through another  
 the neurobiology of fairness and social justice  an introduction the study of social justice has always been an interdisciplinary undertaking  but in recent years neurobiologists have joined scholars and scientists from other areas to tackle complex questions concerning fairness  empathy  equality  hierarchy  and ideological conflict and polarization  by synthesizing insights from multiple  mutually informative levels of analysis  it is possible to shed new light on basic biological processes that reflect  inspire  and inhibit the pursuit of a more just society  with this special issue we highlight groundbreaking research on the neurobiology of fairness and social justice  bringing together six articles that address core themes of social justice  including individual variability in definitions of fairness  the genetic basis of economic egalitarianism  neural bases of empathy in environmental and intergroup domains  and the neural and genetic correlates of ideological polarization  taken in conjunction  these diverse contributions bring multiple theoretical perspectives and research methods to bear on the shared goal of understanding and promoting social justice  
 the new principle policy gap  how diversity ideology subverts diversity initiatives colorblind ideology is a dominant mode of thinking about race matters in the united states  but it is not the only racial ideology that operates today  the united states appears to be shifting toward becoming more race conscious  we add to the critical diversity studies literature  and argue that even though we see a greater appreciation for the presence of nonwhite bodies in various spaces  we are not likely to see real systemic change in the american racial hierarchy because of a reliance on diversity ideology  through an analysis of semistructured interviews with 43 white millennials  this article outlines the ways in which diversity ideology s four tenets diversity as acceptance  commodity  intent  and liability help whites maintain power in multiracial spaces  this article pinpoints how whites employ these tenets to subvert policy efforts that aim to incorporate people of color into predominately white institutions  introducing a new principle policy gap for the twenty first century  
 the nexus of war  resettlement  and education  war affected youth s perspectives and responses to the quebec education system this article examines the realities of war affected youth living in quebec  canada  and in particular  their experiences and responses to education upon resettlement  in our qualitative study  using both in depth interviews and focus groups  we queried 22 young people affected by war  our thematic analysis describes the challenges youth faced in school after having experienced war related trauma and migration  despite existing international and national education frameworks  education policies and provisions are largely lacking and ill equipped to support refugees  unique needs  youth felt that teachers and support staff tended to overlook young people s pre migratory lives  as well as post migratory realities  to facilitate resettlement  war affected refugee youth sought connections beyond school in the form of peers  surrogate families  or community members from the same country of origin  these non formal educational supports demonstrate youth s agency  illustrating high bonding social capital  to support youth at the nexus of war  resettlement  and education  our  findings point to the need for greater consideration of both pre and post migratory experiences  as well as for increased bridging and social capital to strengthen the linkages across student school community in ways that both build upon and respond to the strengths and challenges of war affected children  
 the nigerian civil registration and vital statistics system  contexts  institutions  operation civil registration and vital statistics  crvs  systems are playing increasing roles in national and global data infrastructure  facilitating the achievement of key developmental goals  the performance of crvs systems in many developing countries including nigeria is sub optimal and information on their structure and operations scanty  this paper characterizes the statutory  institutional  and operational elements and social contexts of the nigerian crvs system  it includes a context analysis of the system and a review of improvement strategies and interventions  the paper shows that the nigerian crvs system is built on viable statutory and institutional platforms the constitutional enshrinement of  universal  compulsory and continuous civil registration and  a central registration institution the national population commission  npc   npc has registration hierarchy and infrastructure deployed at every level of political administration and mechanisms for efficient coordination of registration and production of vital statistics on live births  deaths and stillbirths amongst other vital events  the major weaknesses of the system include inadequate financing and deployment of registration facilities  conflicting statutes and institutional arrangements for the registration of key events like death and stillbirths  other weaknesses include intra organizational conflicts in resource allocation and weak ict infrastructure within the npc  these are compounded by overarching contextual issues namely registration unfriendly sociocultural norms  weak national data infrastructure  systemic corruption  poverty and undeveloped civic culture  domestic initiatives and interventions to improve the system have focused on birth registration  while multilateral interventions have only made a modest impact on the system  thus  holistic in country improvement initiatives supported with robust interventions are imperative to overcome weaknesses in the nigerian crvs system  however fundamental improvements in crvs systems in developing countries like nigeria may likely only follow sustainable solutions to overarching contextual issues especially poor infrastructure  weak institutions  poverty and systemic corruption  
 the omnivore s neighborhood  online restaurant reviews  race  and gentrification social media users who post restaurant reviews on the website yelp com act as both prosumers or produsers and discursive investors in gentrification  their unpaid online reviews create cultural and financial value for individual restaurants and also construct a positive or negative image of their locations that may lead to economic investment  moreover  yelp reviewers show marked preferences in terms of race  examining 7046 yelp reviews of restaurants in a predominantly white gentrifying and a predominantly black gentrifying neighborhood of brooklyn  ny  shows far more reviewers draw attention to the urban locale when the majority of residents are black  a framing analysis of 1056 reviews that mention the neighborhood indicates that most yelp reviewers feel positive about the white neighborhood  where they consider the traditional polish restaurants authentic and cozy  while they feel negative about the black neighborhood  which they criticize for a dearth of dining options and an atmosphere of dirt and danger  this language represents discursive redlining in the digital public realm  with yelp reviewers contributing to taste driven processes of gentrification and racial change  
 the openness of open application programming interfaces as a way to provide services or data to third party developers  open application programming interfaces  open apis  have gained popularity among the programming community in recent years  many corporations such as google  facebook and twitter are developing open apis for their existing services  and most of them are free of charge  as these free apis facilitate collaboration between different software platforms  many programmers treat them as alternatives to open source  yet  some programmers have found this collaboration risky to their independence  and they have started to think about the true meaning of the openness of api  more importantly  the definition of open apis is rendered ambiguous through the discursive practices that define openness  in contemporary digital culture  drawing on the political economy of programming and software  this study begins with the historical discussion of openness and its relationship with the power of code in programming  it points out the openness in programming is not only about the accessibility of the source code  but also the liberty to use source code without restriction  this paper then identifies the technical features of open apis and examines the subtle power that restricts their openness  it concludes by suggesting ways to critically understand the openness of software and their politics  
 the optimism trap  migrants  educational choices in stratified education systems immigrant children s ambitious educational choices have often been linked to their families  high level of optimism and motivation for upward mobility  however  previous research has mostly neglected alternative explanations such as information asymmetries or anticipated discrimination  moreover  immigrant children s higher dropout rates at the higher secondary and university level suggest that low performing migrant students could have benefitted more from pursuing less ambitious tracks  especially in countries that offer viable vocational alternatives  we examine ethnic minority s educational choices using a sample of academically low performing  lower secondary school students in germany s highly stratified education system  we find that their families  optimism diverts migrant students from viable vocational alternatives  information asymmetries and anticipated discrimination do not explain their high educational ambitions  while our findings further support the immigrant optimism hypothesis  we discuss how its effect may have different implications depending on the education system   c  2017 published by elsevier inc  
 the pacification of elite lifestyles  state formation  elite reproduction  and the practice of hunting in early modern england what explains the remarkable metamorphosis of elites from warrior nobilities into well mannered aristocrats in early modern europe  existing accounts emphasize the coercive force of emerging states or the novel enticements of royal courts  well suited to the paradigmatic case of early modern france  such arguments fail to explain cases  like england  in which elites developed pacified lifestyles in the absence of a dominant royal court and largely prior to the monopolization of physical force  this essay shows that explaining such cases requires greater attention to the historical variability of elites  own interests and strategies  i argue that european elites  also  developed pacified lifestyles insofar as they came to reproduce themselves through strategies that operated without their personal use of physical violence  including  but not limited to  royal courts   such strategies were contingent on varying configurations of inter elite and elite non elite relations  i employ this perspective to explain the marginalization of violent skills and codes in the lifestyles of early modern english elites  focusing empirically on the practice of hunting  a defining ritual of elite lifestyles  the hunting evidence suggests that the landed gentry were the first english elite to develop a pacified lifestyle  yet the gentry were neither subject to the coercion of a centralized state nor incorporated into a court society  instead  i show that the gentryand later  the nobility and monarchydeveloped pacified lifestyles because they came to reproduce themselves through legal strategies  the successful performance of which required nonviolent skills and habits  
 the paradox of professional marginality among arab bedouin women this study examines the mechanisms that create a paradox of marginality among middle class arab bedouin professional women in israel by applying an intersectional analysis of their everyday professional life  it shows that the paradox of their marginality   despite their possessing high educational capital in their society  comparable to that of highly educated professional jewish  men and women  and arab bedouin male colleagues   is reproduced through the differential validation of embodied cultural capital based on women s cultural roles solely as a symbol of their professional inferiority  the study indicates that when their professional capital intersects with other power axes within the public sphere   for example  ethnicity racism  gender  religious norms and tribalism   it is not accorded recognition or legitimacy by male arab bedouin professionals or by jewish professionals  colleagues and clients  thus giving rise to representational intersectionality  
 the particularity of the universal  critical reflections on bourdieu s theory of symbolic power and the state a critical review of bourdieu s theory of the state is developed here against the backdrop of both his wider theoretical project and empirical studies  elaborating the concepts of symbolic capital  symbolic violence  and symbolic domination  the centrality that bourdieu accords to symbolic forms is compared to benchmark weberian accounts that start with the state monopoly of violence  reviewing also some of the burgeoning secondary literature discussing his theory of the state  bourdieu s writings  which encompass various antinomies  are shown to vacillate between two distinct perspectives a strong and a weak theory of the state  his rejection of the  physicalist  approaches of marx  elias  and tilly is elaborated and subject to a counter critique  particularly in relation to the notion of symbolic  violence   bourdieu s account of the state is shown to be as much a political as theoretical intervention  his antagonism towards marxist accounts in particular is shown to be rooted in a pragmatic interest in the role of the  left hand of the state  in progressive reform  and this perspective is traced back to the twin influences of durkheim and hegel  french republicanism  and in particular the potential of the state to express a universal interest  at the same time  compared with sophisticated marxist and weberian accounts and the work of norbert elias and gramsci  bourdieu s theory is shown to be severely lacking in the way that he deals with violence and coercion  his  expanded materialism   particularly with the  strong theory   bends the stick too far and overplays the symbolic basis of consent  nevertheless  bourdieu s insights with regard to the pervasive influences of state practices of classification  taxonomy  delegation  and naming are shown to have real utility with regard to focused empirical investigations of the state in modern societies  
 the past ubiquity and environment of the lost earth buildings of scotland this paper investigates the once ubiquitous vernacular earth built structures of scotland and how perceptions of such buildings were shaped and developed through periods of intense cultural and environmental change  we focus upon the past exploitation of traditional resources to construct vernacular architectures and on changes in the perception of the resultant buildings  historic earth built structures are today deeply hidden within the landscapes of scotland  although they were once a common feature of both urban and rural settlements  whilst the eighteenth and nineteenth century period of improvement   during which many of these structures were destroyed  repurposed  or left to decay   has received extensive attention by historians  there exists no previous serious study of the human and environmental dimensions  through analysis of the material aspects of landscape resource use and analysis of the historical perceptions of such use  we emphasize the national significance of this undervalued aspect of scotland s built and cultural heritage  increasingly at risk of being lost completely  highlighting the prior ubiquity of mudwall structures

 the plurality of peter berger s  two pluralisms  in germany the aim of this paper is to unfold peter l  berger s new paradigm of the  two pluralisms  for the german context  concretizing and localizing the management of religious plurality with regard to central societal fields  it is argued that  besides the bird s eye view of the global and national developments  more differentiated analyses of smaller scale units  like federal states  municipalities  and cities  are needed which zoom into the concrete local negotiation processes  opening them up with regard to their topics  actor constellations  dynamics  and effects  while berger builds up his new paradigm in the connection of the social macro level and the individual micro level  this paper deals primarily with the meso level and the consequences of the  two pluralisms  in the institutional contexts of politics law  education  symbolic representation  and communication that are currently undergoing a significant change through secularization and religious pluralization while  however  have so far hardly been examined with regard to their dynamics and the intended integrative effects  
 the political economy of  creative industries  this article critically examines the fundamental premise of the creative industries discourse  human creativity as a distinctive input in the production process is the core source of economic value generation  it points out that this discourse emerged within the political economic context of our time where creativity and knowledge are celebrated  while human labour itself as a factor of production and social force is increasingly de legitimised and marginalised  the article argues that the radical potential in the discourse  the labour value nexus  has failed to be recognised  and asks how it can be rediscovered and linked to contemporary socio economic debates  turning its attention to the creativity residing in the cultural sector  this article also argues that we should better understand its economic characteristics  productivity low  and social consequences  diversity high   and their implications for cultural policy  
 the political power of finance  the institute of international finance in the greek debt crisis through empirical investigation of the eurozone and greek debt crisis 2010 12  this article demonstrates how a peak organization of financial firmsthe institute of international finance  iif was able to mobilize its members transnationally to secure several key political and economic objectives  at the height of the crisis  large european banking firms were threatened by the prospect of a disorderly greek default  coercive intervention by governments  and  potentially  a regional banking collapse  in this context  representatives from the iif entered the policymaking process to facilitate concerted private sector action  assisting eu officials with the negotiation of a substantial and orderly creditor writedown  and cooperating with legal action by the greek government to sideline a minority of financial firms hostile to the deal  the article shows that the iif s disproportionate influence over policymaking was a result of their technical expertise  their ability to recruit individuals with long standing experience of sovereign debt restructuring from the public and private sector  and the operation of elite revolving door processes  in contrast to recent studies showing that financial actors are able to exercise more power at the national level by remaining collectively inactive  these findings suggest that  at the transnational level  financial actors can be most effective at securing their preferences when they are well organized and when they coordinate politically on the basis of collective interests  
 the politics of knowledge as a tourist attraction the past ten years have seen an increasing interest in the politics of knowledge production in tourism studies  however  tourists  hosts  politics of knowledge  the ways in which tourists  hosts can use local knowledge as both a tourist attraction and a way to negotiate power relationships  are yet to be explored  this article identifies the need for more analysis of the political uses of cultural knowledge as a tourist attraction  reporting on an ethnographic study of the politics of knowledge unfolded by an aboriginal group of western australia in the context of their tour guiding activities  it will hopefully contribute to a better understanding of the political conditions  and potentials for  local cultural knowledge  re production and utilization in tourism   c  2017 elsevier ltd  all rights reserved  
 the politics of nationalism and white racism in the uk this paper considers the contemporary significance of white racism and its association with nationalist sentiment amongst a cohort late middle aged white britons  using survey responses and qualitative interviews from the 1958 national child development study  we have shown that although overt racism is very limited  a substantial minority of white britons display ambivalent feelings which have the potential to be mobilised in racist directions  we argue against the view that disadvantaged white working class respondents are especially xenophobic  and show that racist views are not strongly associated with social position  in exploring the clustering of different nationalist and racist sentiments amongst economic and cultural elites  and comparing these with disenfranchised  respondents with little economic and cultural capital  we show that it is actually the elite who are most likely to articulate imperial racism   by contrast  the disenfranchised  articulate a kind of anti establishment nationalism which is not strongly racist  we also show that the elite are strongly internally divided  with a substantial number of the cultural elite being strongly anti racist and committed to multi culturalism  so generating strong internal factionalism between elite positions  our paper therefore underscores how intensifying inequalities have facilitated the volatility and variability of nationalist and racist sentiment  
 the politics of race in cultural distribution  addressing inequalities in british asian theatre this article has two aims  firstly  it challenges the assumption in both policy and media studies of race that increasing the number of minorities in the media will automatically lead to more diverse content  secondly  it highlights how cultural distribution is a critical  yet under researched  moment for racialised minorities working in the arts  using a case study on british asian theatre   the article problematises a particular cultural policy approach that emphasises the need to attract new audiences   while the emphasis on bringing marginalised audiences to the arts is welcome  this article argues that attempts to address racial inequalities in production and consumption in this way  reinforce rather than dismantle them  
 the politics of social status  economic and cultural roots of the populist right this paper explores the factors that have recently increased support for candidates and causes of the populist right across the developed democracies  especially among a core group of working class men  in the context of debates about whether the key causal factors are economic or cultural  we contend that an effective analysis must rest on understanding how economic and cultural developments interact to generate support for populism  we suggest that one way to do so is to see status anxiety as a proximate factor inducing support for populism  and economic and cultural developments as factors that combine to precipitate such anxiety  using cross national survey data from 20 developed democracies  we assess the viability of this approach  we show that lower levels of subjective social status are associated with support for right populist parties  identify a set of economic and cultural developments likely to have depressed the social status of men without a college education  and show that the relative social status of those men has declined since 1987 in many of the developed democracies  we conclude that status effects provide one pathway through which economic and cultural developments may combine to increase support for the populist right  
 the post secular  paradigm shift or provocation  in the twentieth century  the social scientific study of religion was dominated by debates surrounding secularization  yet throughout its reign  secularization theory was subject to a series of theoretical and empirical challenges  pronouncements of a forthcoming revolution in theory were frequent  yet secularization theory remained largely undisturbed  however  recent years have seen secularization theory decreased in status  some have located its heir in the post secular  yet the concept has invited fractious debate  this article surveys a range of engagements with the post secular  seeking to identify convergences that sit beneath an otherwise divided field  while this survey reveals the failure of the post secular to fully supplant secularization theory  it does find that central debates in the field today have departed significantly from earlier generations of scholarship  particularly in a reflexivity toward the field s basic concepts  a skepticism of teleological theories of history  and a renewed focus on the relationship between religion and politics  
 the potential of direct democracy  a global measure  1900 2014  to what extent is direct democracy achieved in current polities  to answer this question  i develop an index  direct democracy practice potential  which is applied to 200 polities worldwide  this index results from the aggregation of the scores of four types of mechanisms of direct democracy  popular initiatives  popular referendums  obligatory referendums  and authorities  plebiscites  this index measures   1  how easy it is to initiate and approve each type of popular vote  and  2  how consequential that vote is  if approved   ease of initiation is measured by   a  the existence of a direct democracy process   b  the number of signatures needed  and  c  time limits to collect signatures  ease of approval is measured by quorums pertaining to   a  participation   b  approval   c  supermajority  and  d  district majority  regarding how consequential the vote is  it considers its decisiveness  whether the decision is binding   and the threat capability of citizen initiated mechanisms of direct democracy as measured by the frequency with which direct popular votes have been used and approved in the past  finally  the study tests the validity of the new measure  discussing its strengths and limitations  
 the poverty penalty and microcredit a poverty penalty arises when the poor pay more than the non poor to access goods and services  an example is the cost to access credit  microfinance institutions  mfis  usually explain their high interest rates on the grounds of the high risk involved in microcredit  the high fixed cost associated with small loans and the high financial expenses borne by mfis due to difficulties in deposit collection  the paper finds that a poverty penalty exists  after identifying drivers of the poverty penalty in a sample of mfis from 17 countries  this paper focuses on the colombian case  operating costs is the most important factor explaining effective interest rates  other factors  such as risk  cost of funds  or profitability  are relevant in some regions  this paper encourages transparent pricing as a keystone for ethics in these entities  
 the practical logic of political domination  conceptualizing the clientelist habitus this article aims to redirect the study of patronage politics toward its quotidian character and acknowledge the key role played by brokers  strong ties with their closest followers to better understand and explain the practical features of clientelist domination  this article argues that clientelist politics occur during routine daily life and that most loyal clients  behavior should be understood and explained neither as the product of rational action nor the outcome of normative behavior but as generated by a clientelist habitus  a set of cognitive and affective political dispositions manufactured in the repeated interactions that take place within brokers  inner circles of followers  the article also has as a secondary objective to contribute to dispositional sociology through the conceptualization of the clientelist habitus  it does so by showing the active work agents engage in as they prevent disjunctures provoked by what bourdieu calls the hysteresis effect  
 the presentation of possible selves in everyday life  the management of identity among transitioning professional athletes in contrast to research  which privileges the notion of an exclusive athletic identity  we argue that the identity management of professional athletes is influenced by the expectations of audiences and the motivational weight of  possible selves  in explaining career transitions from  sports work   qualitative vignette interviews were conducted with 10 male participants  ages 18 26 years  on three separate occasions  30 interviews   all interviewees had experienced a career transition from premier league football in the uk  by integrating goffnian s  1971  dramaturgical analogy and markus and nurius s  1986  concept of possible selves we illustrate the way athletes manage their identities to explain how understandings of career transitions are linked to social audiences and whether they dramatically realize and legitimize future possible selves  
 the prisonized old head  intergenerational socialization and the fusion of ghetto and prison culture over the last four decades  the united states  criminal justice system has undergone a historic expansion  which has disproportionately impacted poor urban neighborhoods  the meteoric rise in the percentage of the urban poor either on their way to  in  or recently released from jail or prison has led a number of scholars to theorize a fusion of ghetto and prison culture  wacquant 2001   the exact sources and contours of this fusion  however  remain unspecified  how  concretely  are the cultural contexts of prisons transmitted to poor urban neighborhoods  this article proposes that intergenerational socialization is a key mechanism in this process  we contend that the dramatic expansion of the criminal justice system over the last four decades has given rise to an unexpected and peculiar form of socialization  provided by a new social actorwhat we term the prisonized old head  we define the prisonized old head as an individual who exhibits three particular characteristics  they are  1  older individuals with extensive experiences in  and wisdom about  the criminal justice system  who  2  informally socialize neighborhood residents to embrace the cultural schemas and routines learned inside penal spaces  to  3  navigate the daily exigencies routinely faced in the neighborhood context  stated simply  prisonized old heads leverage ways of life developed on the inside as strategies for living life on the outside  we articulate the emergence  mechanisms  and implications of this form of socialization drawing on fieldwork data in los angeless  skid row neighborhoodone of the premier reentry communities in the united states  we show that although this socialization may contribute to desistance and self transformation  it can simultaneously constrain upward mobility and limit reintegration  
 the process of creating an ethnodrama highlighting late life potential through nursing student and older adult collaboration the purpose of this article is to describe the process of creating an ethnodrama focusing on possible selves  twelve older adult residents of an assisted living facility were paired with 12 nursing students to conduct semistructured interviews on the topic of possible selves  interviews were analyzed in an iterative process involving in vivo and pattern coding  themes relating to late life potential were identified  including hopes  fears  barriers  and aids to possibility  the ethnodrama was outlined from these themes and composite characters were created to represent findings  ten final interviews were recorded with student adult dyads reading the script and providing feedback as member checks  the final draft was work shopped with a theatre company  ethnodrama has the potential of increasing innovation in research but methodology must be clarified to improve consistency and rigor leading to greater acceptance in the research community  
 the projectilic image  islamic state s digital visual warfare and global networked affect islamic state s  is  image warfare presents an auspicious opportunity to grasp the growing role of digital images in emerging configurations of global conflict  to understand is  image warfare  this article explores the central role of digital images in the group s war spectacle and identifies a key modality of this new kind of warfare  global networked affect  to this end  the analysis focuses on three primary sources  two arabic language is books  management of savagery  2004  and o  media worker  you are a mujahid   2nd edition  2016   and a video  healing the believers  chests  2015   featuring the spectacular burning of a jordanian air force pilot captured by is  it uses the method of iconology  within a case study approach  i analyze is  doctrine of image warfare explained in the two books and  in turn  examine how this doctrine is executed in is video production  conceptualizing digital video as a specific permutation of moving digital images uniquely able to enact  and via repetition  to maintain  visual and narrative tension between movement and stillness  speed and slowness  that diffuses global network affect  using a theoretical framework combining spectacle  new media phenomenology  and affect theory  the article concludes that global networked affect is projectilic  mimicking fast  lethal  penetrative objects  is visual warfare  i argue  is best understood through the notion of the projectilic image   
 the pros and cons of researching events ethnographically events  remarkable  disruptive happenings  are important subjects of study for understanding processes of change  in this essay  i reflect upon the issue of what the ethnographic method has to offer for the analysis of this social phenomenon  to do so  i review three recently published ethnographic studies of events  my conclusion is that it is indeed a very useful method for understanding the feelings and ideas of people who are experiencing eventful situations  for instance around protests or natural disasters  however  using this method also brings about practical difficulties  such as the luck  that an event occurs at the ethnographic fieldwork site  next  as transformative responses to events are not bound by the place or time of the happening  other methods  interviews  discourse analysis  surveys  that make it easier to follow them in varying locations and periods might be more suitable for getting a comprehensive picture of their meaning making dynamics  
 the railway switches of history  the development of disease control in britain and the united states in the 19 th  and early 20 th  century when britain and the united states began to respond to outbreaks of disease in the 19 th  century they developed two distinct systems of disease control  while not polar opposites  britain focused primarily on sanitation  whereas the united states adopted policies of quarantine  utilizing the approach of path dependency i argue that this divergence can be partly explained by the timing of disease control formation in each country  as britain formed its system of disease control earlier  during the 1840s  it was influenced by a miasmatic understanding of disease  the belief that disease is caused by noxious gases that emanate from filthy environments   while as the united states formed its disease control system later  around the end of the 1870s  it was more influenced by new ideas about contagion and the rise of germ theory  once formed  the public health system of each country began to travel down divergent historical paths  britain came to connect disease control to the social problems of the working classes  e g  poverty  working conditions  overcrowding  while the united states developed a militaristic approach that  at times  used quite coercive measures to isolate the contagious bodies of the sick  the origins of public health formation in each country helped shape the overall development of disease control in britain and the united states over the long term  
 the rainbow effect  media freedom  internet access  and gay rights objectives  what accounts for the variation in the status of gay rights across countries  we consider the effects of media freedom and internet access and hypothesize that it is the combination of the two that matters for promoting gay rights  methods  using cross national time series data drawn from a variety of sources  we test our hypotheses using a measure of lesbian  gay  and bisexual legal equality  results  our results indicate that the effects of media freedom and internet access on gay rights are each conditional on the other  it is the interaction of media freedom and internet access that has a statistically significant and positive effect on gay rights  without media freedom  internet access has no significant effect and vice versa  conclusion  all else being equal  we observe greater respect for gay rights in those countries featuring a combination of both free media and higher rates of internet access  
 the recent occupation and industry employment patterns of american veterans programs aiming to ease the transition from military to civilian life have increasingly focused on specific occupation areas where veteran skills might overlap with civilian job requirements  this research uses the american community survey to examine the occupations and industries that veterans tend to work in as well as how veteran incomes compare to similar nonveterans in each area  results show that veterans tend to seek civilian occupations where military experience is likely to apply  as areas of veteran overrepresentation echo technical military functions  furthermore  veterans generally tend to earn higher incomes than similar nonveterans in these areas of potential military civilian overlap  but most income differences are relatively moderate  the results imply that programs encouraging transitioning military members to find a civilian occupation that is similar to their military experience may better assist those in military occupations with clear civilian applications  
 the relationship between musical preferences  personal values and personality traits the main goals of this research were to explore the relationship between music preferences  schwartz s personal values and dark triad traits  as well as to investigate whether there are stereotypes on listeners of specific musical genres  there were 510 participants  croatian students  in the first part of the research  focused on exploring the mentioned relations  participants completed the musical preference questionnaire constructed for the purpose of this research  the short dark triad  jones   paulhus  2014  and portrait values questionnaire  schwartz et al   2001   in the second part  115 participants from the first part of the study estimated the typical fans of specific music genres in a questionnaire constructed for this research based on the dark triad questionnaire and portrait values questionnaire  the results have shown a low to medium correlation between the dark triad and personal values  as well as low and in most cases insignificant correlation of music preferences with the dark triad and personal values  the results also point out the existence of stereotypes of an individual s characteristics based on their preferred music genre  which were especially negative towards fans of turbofolk music  
 the relationship between societal change and rising support for gender egalitarianism among men and women  results from counterfactual analyses in the netherlands  1979 2012 this study examines the relationship between important social  cultural  economic  and demographic changes and the rise of support for gender egalitarianism within the dutch population between 1979 and 2012  cohort replacement  educational expansion  secularization  and the feminization of the labor force are important processes that have taken place in western societies in ways that may have fostered support for gender egalitarianism  using unique data from 16 repeated cross sectional surveys in the netherlands  we estimate age period cohort regression models  and the outcomes are subsequently applied in counterfactual simulation designs  our results show that the social  cultural  economic  and demographic changes explain only a small part of the modest rise in support for gender egalitarianism for men  while they provide a much better explanation of the stronger rise among women  especially the replacement of older female cohorts by younger ones seems to have propelled support for gender egalitarianism among women throughout the years   c  2017 elsevier inc  all rights reserved  
 the respectable brotherhood  young black men in an all boys charter high school neoliberal public school reform has revitalized efforts to open unique all male schools for black boys  existing research stresses how these black male academies nurture resilience but has failed to examine what makes these schools distinctive  drawing on one year of ethnographic research  this article demonstrates how northside academy  an all male charter high school  built a respectable brotherhood  modeled after elite all male institutions  northside s classics curriculum and professional uniform marked its young men as having disciplined minds and bodies  destined for college and a middle class future  yet to maintain legitimacy within a competitive environment  the school community drew moral boundaries between its exceptional young men and those delinquent boys most in crisis  this engaged a respectability politics where upwardly mobile black men reject their more marginalized peers for failing to reform their character  this study s findings extend knowledge of single sex public schools and of the impact of increased competition under neoliberalism  
 the revolt of the rust belt  place and politics in the age of anger this paper argues that the election of donald trump is the product of a confluence of historical factors rather than the distinctive appeal of the victor himself  by paying particular attention to the geography of unusual voting behaviour the analytical question comes into view  why did so much uncharacteristic voting occur in the rust belt states of the upper midwest  it is impossible to answer this question adequately using conventional categorical attributes  the usual hypotheses of economic anxiety  and white revanchism are unable to account for sudden shifts in the voting behaviour of both white and black voters in post industrial territories  instead  it is necessary to turn to the history of the region and the institutional apparatus that connected voters there to the federal government and the democratic party  from this perspective we can see that the active dismantling of the fordist social order set the region on a divergent path from the rest of the country  but this path had no political outlet due to the reorientation of the democratic party around a new class and geographic base  due to this  the party pursued policies that would magnify the region s difficulties rather than alleviate its circumstances  moreover  the elaborate institutional ties that connected the region s voters to the democratic party and the federal government meant that the political implications of regional decline would be muted  however  as these institutions frayed  rust belt voters were made available to candidates that challenged the policy consensus that had done so much damage to the region  the election was decided by a rust belt revolt that unified black and white working class voters against hillary clinton and the democratic party  
 the rise of food banks and the challenge of matching food assistance with potential need  towards a spatially specific  rapid assessment approach in the united states  food banks served an estimated 46 million people in 2015  a combination of government policy reforms and political economic trends contributed to the rising numbers of individuals relying on private food assistance in the us  the united kingdom and other high income countries  although researchers frequently map urban food environments  this project is one of the first to map private food assistance and potential need at the census tract scale  we utilize geographic information systems  demographic data  and food assistance locations to develop a rapid assessment tool that could support food banks  pantries  soup kitchens  and government agencies that seek to answer the question of whether people with the greatest need have food distribution sites in close proximity  we define access based on distance and then calculate potential food insecurity using either poverty rates or a food insecurity index  we apply these methods in a case study analysis of santa clara county  california  our findings suggest that food assistance distribution locations match the areas of potential need in more than 80  of urban census tracts  however  there are several potentially underserved locations and populations that could benefit from new food assistance operations  the poverty and index based approaches show significant spatial overlap in mapped areas of high food insecurity and low access  the poverty only approach produces a higher estimate of food insecurity rates  is easier to calculate  and draws attention to the need to address poverty as a root cause of hunger  
 the rising burden of healthcare expenditure in india  a poverty nexus the increasing burden of communicable and non communicable diseases are imposing unavoidable costs on indians  as a consequence it exacerbate poverty and drag many poor further down by heavy medical expenses  this study aims to estimate the extent of healthcare expenditure on the individuals who were hospitalized due to various diseases  further  this study examines the burden of healthcare expenditure on impoverishment level in india  the unit level record of the 71st round of the national sample survey office  nsso  is used in the analysis  the result reveals  cost of hospitalization due to non communicable diseases is three times higher than communicable diseases in india  therefore  an overall level of impoverishment has been increased by 1 61 percent year which shows the high financial risk for the people surviving at the threshold of poverty  
 the role of alcohol in identity construction among lgbt people  a qualitative study research suggests that alcohol use and misuse are higher among lesbian  gay and bisexual than heterosexual populations  yet the social context of drinking in sexual minority communities has rarely been examined  to explore lesbian  gay  bisexual and transgender  lgbt  people s relationship with alcohol  we conducted seven focus groups  n   33  with pre existing groups of friends and work colleagues  18 to 52 years  in scotland  uk  we identified and analysed patterns in our data using thematic analysis  respondents perceived heavy drinking as central to the commercial gay scene  choice of drink and drinking vessel was an important part of identity construction  respondents discussed the perception that gay men would drink alcopops and cocktails while lesbians would drink pints of beer  even when stereotypes were dismissed as inaccurate  they were still thought to pressure people to drink appropriately   respondents who did not identify as male or female  and those who used drag  were particularly aware of their choice of drink as a means to express identity or to challenge people s preconceptions about gender  researchers developing interventions to reduce alcohol related harm in sexual minority populations need to take account of the central role of identity construction in lgbt drinking practices  
 the role of aspirations and obligations in explaining the relationship between identity discrepancies and psychological distress using a national sample of adults  we examine the relationship between identity discrepancies and mental health in spouse and worker identities  building on previous research  we predict that discrepancies between how individuals want to be with respect to a particular identity  aspirations  and perceptions of how others view them in that identity  reflected appraisals  will be associated with depressive symptoms  alternatively  discrepancies between how individuals feels they should be  obligations  and reflected appraisals will be associated with anxiety symptoms  we further examine whether identity salience moderates the relationship between discrepancies and distress  we find aspiration discrepancies are associated with depression as predicted in the spouse identity but not for the worker identity  with respect to obligation discrepancies  we find evidence for the predicted relationships for the spouse and worker identity only when identities are considered salient  we discuss the implications of our findings for the development of identity models of distress  
 the role of education for intergenerational income mobility  a comparison of the united states  great britain  and sweden previous studies have found that intergenerational income persistence is relatively high in the united states and britain  especially as compared to nordic countries  we compare the association between family income and sons  earnings in the united states  national longitudinal study of youth 1979   britain  british cohort study 1970   and sweden  population register data  1965 cohort   and find that both income elasticities and rank order correlations are highest in the united states  followed by britain  with sweden being clearly more equal  we ask whether differences in educational inequality and in return to qualifications can explain these cross country differences  surprisingly  we find that this is not the case  even though returns to education are higher in the united states  instead  the low income mobility in the united states and britain is almost entirely due to the part of the parent son association that is not mediated by educational attainment  in the united states and especially britain  parental income is far more important for earnings at a given level of education than in sweden  a result that holds also when controlling for cognitive ability  this goes against widespread ideas of the united states as a country where the role of ascription is limited and meritocratic stratification prevails  
 the role of family policy in explaining the international variation in child subjective well being the article proposes an innovative analyse for cross national differences in the subjective child well being introducing new indicators and measures  this dimension addresses the issue of welfare support to parents and child early education  the question of this research is to what extend family policies can explain the variability of subjective child well being components in different european countries  based on this question  the two objective of this proposal are   1  to review the existing literature with respect to conceptualization  measurement  and correlates of children s subjective well being  with a special emphasis on the context of family policies and family well being in different european welfare states  and  2  to analyse the relation between these policies and subjective child well being  in order to get these aims we have elaborated two indexes  the index of child subjective well being and family policy index  data for hbsc  health behaviour in school aged children  for the first index and data from oecd family database is used to build these indicators  we found that the index of child subjective well being is comparatively higher in those countries where family policies are more generous in the areas of preschool education  family services  family spending and duration of paid parental leave  
 the role of genes and environments in linking the need to evaluate with political ideology and political extremity understanding the origins of political ideology and political extremity at the individual level is becoming increasingly pressing in the face of polarization in the political domain  building upon the motivated social cognition model of political ideology  we propose a motivated cognition approach to the study of political extremity with the need to evaluate as a key epistemic motive that contributes to political extremity  moreover  we hypothesize that the link between the need to evaluate and political extremity may rest largely on shared genetic effects  this hypothesis builds upon existing biology and politics research  which has convincingly demonstrated that genes influence the direction of ideology  but has been largely silent on the role of genes in political extremity  to test our hypothesis  we consider several types of ideological  affective  and partisan extremity alongside conventional measures of political ideology and the need to evaluate in a behavioral genetic framework  using a twin study methodology  we show for the first that the need to evaluate is heritable  that its phenotypic relationships with ideological extremity and strength are rooted in shared genetic influences  and  unexpectedly  that the relationship between the need to evaluate and some forms of political extremity is largely environmental  in examining the genetic and environmental components of the covariation of the need to evaluate with political ideology and right wing authoritarianism  we find limited support for shared genetic influences  taken together  these results illustrate the value of adopting a biologically informed motivated cognition approach to the study of political ideology and political extremity  
 the role of network setting and gender in online content popularity in this study  we explore the role of specific network structures that enhance social capital and assess the extent to which gender  social ties  and communication interaction relate to content popularity within online social networks  osns   our results are based on an extensive osn data set  containing over 100 000 members  connected by over 1 7 million links  the findings indicate that content popularity inference is more accurate when considering activity interaction among users and that network structures known as advantageous for amassing social capital in the offline environment are relevant online as well  we conclude by discussing how gender mediates the correlation between some network measures and the growth of users  content popularity and provide a potential explanation for the emergence of gender differences  
 the role of partners and workplaces in british and swedish men s parental leave decisions sweden has been long known for its early introduction of parental leave in the 1970s and the introduction of the first nontransferable daddy month in 1995 while the united kingdom  uk  lagged behind with policies that reflected a strong male breadwinner model until the recent introduction of additional paternity leave  which extended paternity leave up to twenty six weeks  our study examines parental leave decisions following the changes in policy  paying particular attention to the role of partners and workplaces  we draw on data from thirty two interviews with swedish parents conducted in 2008 and twenty two interviews with british parents conducted in 2012  we find that mothers in both countries have great influence over parental leave decisions  however  this often perpetuates a much greater gendered division of parental leave in the uk than in sweden  furthermore  the british workplace continues to hold very different expectations for male and female employees regarding parental leave  while swedish employers are generally accepting of men s use of long parental leave  
 the role of qualitative preliminary studies in the development of standardized survey instruments an example from evaluation research in a military context the article addresses the relevance and need for complex mixed methods designs when developing standardized measurement instruments for research in strictly hierarchical institutions  using the evaluation of courses for officer s training in the army service of the german bundeswehr  we demonstrate how a suitable questionnaire can be constructed by conducting an extensive qualitative preliminary study and using mixed methods for an iterative validation process  in addition  the specific nature of both the research field and evaluation studies are considered when addressing the problems of compliance with quality criteria of empirical social research in terms of field access and sample production  
 the role of relative intrinsic aspirations in chinese adolescents  prosocial behaviors we examined chinese adolescents  aspirations and explored the relationship between relative intrinsic aspirations  ria  and prosocial behaviors and whether adolescents with different levels of ria have different emphases on self  and other oriented considerations during prosocial decision making  in study 1  236 participants were recruited and completed a questionnaire containing the aspiration index and prosocial tendencies measure  the results show that ria are positively associated with adolescents  prosocial behaviors  in study 2  158 adolescents completed a questionnaire containing the aspiration index and measurements of prosocial decision making and considerations in prosocial decision making  to some extent  adolescents with a lower level of ria have a greater emphasis on self oriented considerations  whereas adolescents with a higher level of ria have a greater emphasis on other oriented considerations  in addition  both studies suggest that chinese adolescents value intrinsic aspirations above extrinsic ones  
 the role of sampling in mixed methods research enhancing inference quality the purpose of this article is to emphasize the importance of sampling in all mixed methods research studies  effective meaning making in mixed methods research studies is very much dependent on the quality of inferences that emerge  which  in turn  is dependent on the quality of the underlying sampling design  further  these inferences are only of a quality nature if interpretive consistency occurs  which represents the justifiableness of the type of generalization made  given the sampling design  in an earlier work  we identified six sampling based considerations that all mixed methods researchers should make at the four broad stages  i  e   research conceptualization  research planning  research implementation  and research dissemination stages  of the mixed methods research process  emtic orientation  probabilistic orientation  abductive orientation  intrinsic versus instrumental orientation  particularistic versus universalistic orientation  and philosophical clarity  building on this six element framework  we outline how focusing on sampling considerations at the four stages of the mixed methods research process  which includes the dissemination stage of reporting the mixed methods research findings to stakeholders  enhances significantly the process of meaning making  we believe that addressing these sampling considerations at each of these stages will increase the likelihood that the mixed methods researcher will uphold interpretive consistency during the meaning making process  
 the role of school culture and basic psychological needs on iranian adolescents  academic alienation  a multi level examination this aim of this current research was a multi level analysis of the relationship between school culture  basic psychological needs  and adolescents  academic alienation  one thousand twenty nine  n   1 029  high school students from qom city were randomly selected through a multi phase cluster sampling method and answered questions regarding academic alienation  school culture  and basic psychological needs  using hlm software for data analysis  the findings revealed that individual level basic psychological needs had a negative and significant effect on academic alienation  regarding school level  the effects of student teacher relationship and educational opportunity on the academic alienation were negative and significant  in general  research findings emphasized the importance of studying multi level factor roles and their relationship to academic alienation  
 the role of social positioning in observed patterns of material hardship  new evidence from the 2008 survey of income and program participation long term trends in the federal income poverty measure are well documented and researched  but long term trends in material hardship  as an alternative measure of economic well being  are much less well known  in part  this is because data limitations have precluded the study of material hardship at multiple data points over time  using data from the 2008 survey of income and program participation and repeat observations approximately one year apart  this paper uses probit models to analyze separately four domains of material hardship  i e   food insecurity  housing hardship  medical hardship and essential expense hardship  in order to identify demographic characteristics that are associated with whether hardships occur and if they are one time or repeated  the key findings are  1  across all four domains  experiences of material hardship are evenly split between one time and repeated  2  across all four domains  exits from hardship are matched by entrances into hardship  and 3  some demographic factors  such as disability status  are strong and consistent predictors of material hardship across domains and recurrence  while other demographic factors  such as living in a metropolitan area or not  affect domains and recurrence of hardship differently  this analysis not only improves our understanding of how material hardship operates in households  but also demonstrates how material hardship can be a more nuanced and robust measure of economic well being  together with future research  these findings can help policymakers create more targeted and effective interventions that help all americans make ends meet  
 the silencing effects of the childhood innocence ideal  the perceptions and practices of fathers in educating their children about sexuality this study employed interpretative phenomenological analysis to explore eight fathers  perceptions and practices in talking to their ten year old children about puberty  relationships and reproduction  the fathers participated in face to face interviews which were analysed idiographically initially  followed by analysis at the group level  interpretations were then developed through critical application of a foucauldian lens of governmentality and biopower  the results revealed a tension between the fathers  cognitions  accounts and behaviours  their practices were largely characterised by silence yet they reported positive attitudes towards children s sexuality education and perceived themselves as equipped and willing to take on the role of sexuality educator  they also reported enjoying open relationships with their children  interpretations centred on contradictions and conflict between the majority of the fathers  aspirations and the compelling nature of the childhood innocence discourse as a technology of governmentality  whilst all of the fathers felt that it was in their children s interests to learn about sexuality  all but one adhered to hegemonic protective discourses and unquestioningly integrated their normalising effects into their fathering practices which  it is argued  may paradoxically render their children more vulnerable both now and in the future  
 the smallest ideological and political battlefield  depicting borders on postage stamps   the case of israel there are few dozen areas in dispute around the world  where the borders have not been agreed by the involved parties or by the international community  the dispute over the israeli border is particularly complex as it not only presents disagreement between the opposing sides in play but also in the international arena and within the israeli political system and society  this paper examines one way in which the state of israel is trying to define its borders through postage stamps  the argument raised is that israel issues stamps that deal with disputed territorial areas in accordance with the ideology of the ruling party of a certain period  as well as the respective social consensus surrounding a particular area  our findings support this argument and find three meta messages incorporated into the stamps  including the historical connection between the state of israel and the land of israel  unified jerusalem  and the christian connection to jerusalem  
 the social meaning of death and its implications for organ procurement today  the protocols for  donation after cardiac death  allow clinicians to harvest viable vital organs as soon as cardiopulmonary arrest is deemed to be irreversible  typically several minutes after diagnosing a loss of circulatory and respiratory function  although these patients are not brain dead  the irreversibility of circulatory death make these patients suitable donors for organ donation  provided that organ harvesting will take place as soon as possible  in the neurologic definition of death  a person is dead when the whole brain is dead  the continued circulation of blood helps to prevent the organs from deteriorating  making this method superior  brain dead patients still display some residual functions of life  making non health professionals wondering if they are really dead  however  the brain death criteria focus on an event  which can be precisely timed and detected with enough certainty to justify an irrevocable action  such as organ procuring  in this paper we analyze two concepts that surrounds death  both with important implications for the society in general and health professionals in particular   irreversibility    specifically related to the traditional definition of death  the cardio pulmonary definition  and  personhood    especially related to neurologic criteria of death  the brain death definition   
 the social provision of punishment and incarceration standard economic theory proposes that public goods  equally available to everyone  will be underprovided by private markets  individuals can benefit without having to pay  so there is little incentive to invest or manage resources efficiently  the punishment of criminals is an example of this  since everyone in a society benefits from reduced crime whether they pay to apprehend criminals or not  on that basis  it is widely presumed that governments must provide criminal justice services  including prisons  but the evidence in favor of that view is ambiguous  stateless societies throughout history have found ways to maintain public order without ever building a prison  nations with adequate social safety nets and a high degree of equality are also likely to rely on alternatives to incarceration  strong forms of public goods theory  when applied to punishments and prisons  are shown to be false  since crime control does exist without a centralized state  furthermore  the available evidence suggests that centralized government provision and management can also suffer inefficiencies from overproduction  only comparative institutional analysis can speak to the efficiency potentials of punishment  wherein the costs of underproduction are assessed against the likely consequences of overproduction  
 the state and the development of an information society  greek policy and experience the paper looks into the dynamics of information society policy and its implementation in the greek context  it argues that information society development is a contested process  influenced by pre existing state  economy and society relations  based on this  it looks into the different aspects of the idiosyncratic path which the evolution of the greek information society has followed  particularly after 2000  using bob jessop s strategic relational approach  sra  to the state as an analytical framework and drawing on a number of in depth interviews with relevant political actors  it provides insights into policy implementation by examining  the public management of information technology projects  how such projects were received in bureaucratic structures and practices  as well as the relationship between the state and the information and communication technology  ict  sector in public procurement processes  the emphasis is on the period 2000 2008  during which a major operational programme on the information society in greece was put into effect  the paper also touches upon the post 2008 experience  suggesting that information society developments might include dynamics operating independently and even in contradiction to the state agenda  
 the state s role in globalization  korea s experience from a comparative perspective by analyzing how korea has upgraded its industrial capabilities in the course of corporate globalization  this article holds that some versions of developmental state work better in the globalization process  globalizing national corporations  neoliberal optimism notwithstanding  does not necessarily result in upgrading domestic innovation capabilities  in the united states  free market firms may benefit through offshoring  but they create holes in the industrial linkages or industrial commons at home  enfeebling us capability for innovation  by contrast  the korean government successfully upgraded domestic firms  innovation capabilities and reduced the possibility of deindustrialization in the course of globalization by moving from classical developmentalism to a new form of development based on inclusive and collaborative networks  korea s earlier classical developmentalism focused on mobilization of physical capital  funneling it exclusively to a few firms  
 the structural balance theory of sentiment networks  elaboration and test structural balance theory attends to a group s network of sentiments and posits that this network alters over time toward particular structural forms  current work on the theory is focused on understanding the mechanisms that alter sentiments as a function of the configuration of sentiments in which they are embedded  although the theory assumes tension reduction mechanisms  there has been no effort to directly measure and model the temporal changes of individuals  relational tensions that are predicted by the theory  this article elaborates and tests balance theory with an empirical analysis of its posited interpersonal tensions and their reductions via a sentiment conversion process  in addition  the authors open a new line of inquiry on the theory s scope conditions and point to a community commitment condition that is involved in the realization of structural balance  their analysis draws on a unique suite of multiwave measures obtained from the urban communes data set  
 the subject who thinks economically  comparative money subjectivities in neoliberal context theoretically  neoliberalism is acknowledged as a powerful  discursive mode of governmentality  whose key tenets widely influence sociological discourses around the role of money in attaining quality of life and happiness  however  few studies qualitatively reflect in any detail on how neoliberalism is implicated in the making of particular subjectivities  in this comparative study  participants from different income contexts  middle and low income  and downshifters  are interviewed about money meanings with attention to the particular ways of living they narrate  the findings attest to participant adoption of  and or resistance to  lay forms of neoliberalism in the ordering of their subjectivities around key themes  life values  life goals  monetary boundaries and future understandings  their stories show the prevalence of the neoliberal subject and clarify the practical limits of neoliberal discourses  as well as demonstrating how moral alternatives to neoliberalism can transform self understanding and practice  
 the three constituencies of the state  why the state has lost unifying energy we address resurgent populism by examining structural processes of state transformation in the uk  the us and france  scholars stress the unifying energy of the state   a set of institutions and policies capable of limiting inequalities and defending legal regimes  one characteristic of modern western statehood were packages of policies designed to integrate social groups and territories in part by ensuring common standards of provision and social citizenship across the nation state  this echoes james scott s critical analysis of the modernist project of the state  1998   this unifying energy  had different origins including nationalist movements  combatting external influence or powers  war  and preparing citizens for the rigours of industrialization  overcoming class differences and territorial differences  including cultural  social and economic differences  was a major source of mobilization to feed this unifying energy of the state  in france  italy or spain for instance  political and cultural identities are related in significant part to respective nation states  we argue that this unifying energy  was an essential component of statehood in europe and in the us  it is now largely lost  we explain why and the significance of its displacement

 the two hundred and fifty year transition  how the american empire became capitalist this paper aims to rethink united states history from the colonial era through the civil war and reconstruction by examining how capitalism and empire joined together as the logic of expansion increasingly became driven by the logic of capital over approximately two hundred and fifty years  specifically  it argues that  what became  the united states originated as a society with capitalism  and became a capitalist society   this transition was a highly complex and uneven process as a variety of social forms developed and interacted  and in which there was not one road to capitalism  but a variety  depending on the historical circumstance  to accomplish this  first  the article reviews the marx weber debate to develop a theoretical and methodological approach to the historical sociology of capitalism  the remainder of the paper focuses on narrating an empirical interpretation of the transition to capitalism including the diversity of labor forms capital historically utilized  
 the two pluralisms in norway in most countries of western europe including norway  the last decades have transformed the population as a whole to become both more secular and more religiously plural  this has had consequences on many levels  and is still being processed  for state institutions and for the civil society including faith communities  it has clearly entailed legal  political  and social changes  the growing plurality has also challenged alleged mono cultural perceptions of religions  and established many new discourses on religion  values  and diversity as such  in this essay i will first briefly discuss the present situation in norway regarding religious pluralism and relate it to interpretations of secularity particularly relevant to the norwegian context  then i will go more thoroughly into the concept of interreligious dialogue and ways to understand this phenomenon as one of faith communities  responses to religious plurality  as a social practice that may provide insight in how religious plurality is negotiated in a dialogue   it may be described as a practical exploration of religious plurality from the inside   but also how it may project positions towards various understandings of secularity  peter berger s concept of  the two pluralisms  and his request for theorizing on plurality rather than secularity opens up further exploration of interreligious relations such as interreligious dialogue  and it may provide researchers working empirically in this field with new insights in their studies  this contribution will not contest berger s suggestion of  the two pluralisms  but rather explore it further through empirical studies and suggested models of interreligious dialogue  
 the uneven neoliberalization of good works  islamic charitable fields and their impact on diffusion why is neoliberalization experienced unevenly throughout the islamic world  this article explores islam inspired egyptian and turkish organizations  competing orientations to poverty relief  the study is based on interviews  direct observation  and comparative historical analysis  while there was a contested balance between neoliberal and communitarian orientations to charitable giving in egypt  in turkey neoliberal approaches marginalized communitarian ones  these differences can be traced back to a contrast in the combination of two factors  the religious movements and the links between benevolent organizations and the state  the relatively more unified islamic field  which was thoroughly merged with the market friendly state in turkey  fostered the neoliberalization of charity  the fragmented egyptian islamic field  coupled with an unevenly cooperative  even if still market friendly  state  led to the persistence of an embattled communitarianism  a field based analysis allows us to extend the insights of the uneven diffusion literature to micro terrain  
 the use of common area k sample test in evaluating targeting methodologies  an application to the case of egypt this research utilizes a measure for evaluating targeting methodologies that is based on the common area under the kernel densities of per capita expenditure of different poverty groups  the proposed measure is incorporated with misclassification errors  it also compares some variables commonly used in targeting from a multidimensional perspective to show their overlap where standard statistical tests show them as significantly different  such an integrated approach helps identify the complexity of model building thus providing a new tool in guiding social policies focusing on poverty alleviation  to demonstrate the added value of the suggested measure  it is applied to a case study involving different methodologies to target poorest households in regions characterized with high prevalence of poverty in rural upper egypt  results show that trials to classify the surveyed households using different models are faced with large overlap according to the proposed measure even when errors of under coverage and or leakage drop  models built on the national level of poor areas or on regional level do not perform well on the level of these poor villages where geographical targeting would have been optimal  
 the use of facebook for information seeking  decision support  and self organization following a significant disaster the wide spread proliferation of the internet has revolutionized the ways that individuals obtain  interpret  and respond to information in the aftermath of disaster  an f3 tornado that impacted the community of goderich  ontario  on 21 august 2011 provided the opportunity to examine how people utilized facebook and facebook groups to seek out information  self organize  and provide support  this mixed methods project was conducted in two phases  first  semi structured interviews  n 35  were conducted with goderich area residents on their experiences using social media after the tornado  next  all of the publicly available posts and replies on the goderich ontario tornado victims and support  gotvs  facebook group were gathered and analysed using computer assisted content analysis  the results demonstrate that facebook was a highly influential source of information and support  particularly in the immediate aftermath of the disaster  although misinformation and gossip occurred  the tendency was for the group to self moderate inaccurate information  public engagement by local officials may further reduce misinformation and encourage public confidence  the results also show that gotvs activity significantly declined after two weeks  this abrupt decrease in public attention suggests that the window for engagement by public officials is narrow  as such  officials should have a social media plan in place so that they may engage with the public during the critical response phase when their participation may yield the greatest benefit  finally  this research underscores the potential for analysing facebook content using computer assisted content analysis  a method that may be of interest across the social sciences  
 the verification of ethnographic data anthropologists are increasingly required to account for the data on which they base their interpretations and to make it available for public scrutiny and re analysis  while this may seem straightforward  why not place our data in online repositories    it is not  ethnographic data  may consist of everything from verbatim transcripts  hard data   to memories and impressions  soft data    hard data can be archived and re analysed  soft data cannot  the focus on hard objective  data contributes to the delegitimizing of the soft data that are essential for ethnographic understanding  and without which hard data cannot be properly interpreted  however  the credibility of ethnographic interpretation requires the possibility of verification  this could be achieved by obligatory  standardised forms of personal storage with the option for audit if required  and by being more explicit in publications about the nature and status of the data and the process of interpretation  
 the visibility of scientific misconduct  a review of the literature on retracted journal articles retractions of scientific articles are becoming the most relevant institution for making sense of scientific misconduct  an increasing number of retracted articles  mainly attributed to misconduct  is currently providing a new empirical basis for research about scientific misconduct  this article reviews the relevant research literature from an interdisciplinary context  furthermore  the results from these studies are contextualized sociologically by asking how scientific misconduct is made visible through retractions  this study treats retractions as an emerging institution that renders scientific misconduct visible  thus  following up on the sociology of deviance and its focus on visibility  the article shows that retractions  by highlighting individual cases of misconduct and general policies for preventing misconduct while obscuring the actors and processes through which retractions are effected  produce highly fragmented patterns of visibility  these patterns resemble the bifurcation in current justice systems  
 the warm glow of restaurant checkout charity checkout charity is a phenomenon whereby frontline employees  or self service technologies  solicit charitable donations from customers during the payment process  despite its growing ubiquity  little is known about this salient aspect of the service experience  the present research examines checkout charity in the context of fast food restaurants and finds that  when customers donate  they experience a warm glow that mediates a relationship between donating and store repatronage  study 1 utilizes three scenario based experiments to explore the phenomenon across different charities and different participant populations using both self selection and random assignment designs  study 2 replicates with a field study  study 3 examines national store level sales data from a fast food chain and finds that checkout fund raising  as a percentage of sales  predicts store revenuea finding consistent with results of studies 1 and 2  managers often infer  quite correctly  that many consumers do not like being asked to donate  paradoxically  our results suggest this ostensibly negative experience can increase service repatronage  for academics  these results add to a growing body of literature refuting the notion that small prosocial acts affect behavior by altering an individual s self concept  
 the world bank  contradictory lending  and forests  a cross national analysis of organized hypocrisy this article draws on the theory of organized hypocrisy to test the hypothesis that world bank lending in different sectors has contradictory impacts on forests  the authors use ordinary least squares regression to analyze newly available satellite imagery data on forest loss from 2001 to 2014 for a sample of 89 low and middle income nations  the analysis finds support for the theory of organized hypocrisy  the results indicate that world bank structural adjustment lending and investment lending in the agriculture and forestry sectors are related to more forest loss but world bank investment lending in the environmental sector is related to less forest loss  the article concludes with a discussion of the theoretical  methodological  and policy implications  
 the worldwide growth of private higher education  cross national patterns of higher education institution foundings by sector this article investigates cross national patterns of public and private higher education institution  hei  foundings from 1960 to 2006  it argues that in addition to national demographic and economic factors  patterns of hei foundings also reflect world level models about how nations should structure their higher education systems  findings document a rapid  recent rise in new private heis and point to supranational normative  mimetic  and coercive pressures that have encouraged nations to expand private higher education  including international development aid trends in peer nations  and linkages to intergovernmental organizations  i argue that while the public sector hei has been a long standing and globally legitimated model for national development  private higher education has historically been associated with some world regions but not others  however  over the past two decades  supranational actors and ideas helped legitimate the private hei as an acceptable model  spreading it even in regions that previously eschewed private higher education

 theorizing alternatives to capital  towards a critical cosmopolitanist framework 1  we are living in an era of multiple crises  multiple social resistances  and multiple cosmopolitanisms  the post cold war context has generated a plethora of movements  but no single unifying ideology or global political program has yet materialized  the historical confrontation between capital and its alternatives  however  continues to pose new possibilities for social and systemic transformations  critical analysis of ideological divisions among today s diverse emancipatory and transformative movements is important in order to understand past and present shortcomings  and many continuing difficulties in imagining crisis free alternative futures  inspired by a multiplicity of responses from the global south and the global north  and by furthering delanty s critical cosmopolitanist approach  this article aims to create a new framework for interpreting transformative visions  that challenge systems of domination embedded in capitalist social relations  the framework is designed to enable the evaluative analysis of such visions  as well as the exploration of embedded ideological obstacles to dialogue and collaboration among them  
 theory and values in socio legal studies this article argues that socio legal studies  sls  should engage with ultimate values  in max weber s sense  insofar as these influence law and social action linked to law  the article sketches orientations in socio legal research that have deterred concern with such values  it suggests a way to conceptualize values as a component of culture  and illustrates this by reference to aspects of the regulation of religious and ethnic minorities  on the one hand  and business and financial networks  on the other  finally  it considers how sls s commitment to science impacts on the study of values  it argues that empirically grounded socio legal theory can suggest why and how certain ultimate values come to seem meaningful and relevant in particular social conditions  as components of cultural experience  values relate to law in complex ways  and sls can and should give more attention to this relation  
 theory praxis confusion within irish liberalism  the curious case of teenage sexuality the contention that non procreational sex is inherently sinful is a basic tenet of catholic teaching  from a secular liberal perspective this proposition is inverted  yet  despite this ideological clash  in 21st century ireland there exists a unique convergence of views between members of these opposing ideologies when answering the questions as to whether teenagers under 17 should be allowed to control their sexuality and whether it is right to conceive of female teenagers under 17 as less autonomous and less sexual than their male counterparts  utilizing an ideal type irish secular liberal  construction  this article  deploying insights from the foucauldian framework  problematizes the secular liberal response to a series of related issues revolving around the rights of irish teenagers to control their sexuality  it argues that the irish secular liberal regulation of teenage sexuality by reference to the cognitive ability sexual autonomy discourse is not the product of a reflexive concern with the psychological harm that may ensue if underage teenagers engage in sexual relations  rather  it advances the theory that such surveillance  both internal and external  is primarily a means through which the responsible heteronormative adult subject position is produced and governed

 thinking politics and fashion in 1960s cuba  how not to judge a book by its cover this article presents fashion as a mechanism of domination and political legitimacy  focusing on soviet type state socialist regimes  in particular  it documents some dynamics shaping the politics of fashion in the socio political context of 1960s cuba arguing that the consolidation of a radically new political order in the country was based  in part  on the production of denotative logistics that associated clothes with political values  the article concludes that denotative logistics are activated as mechanisms of impersonal rule in periods of political transition or regime change  such as after the triumph of the cuban revolution  in those moments  they articulate processes of social engineering oriented toward producing a new society and a new man  
 threat and prejudice against syrian refugees in canada  assessing the moderating effects of multiculturalism  interculturalism  and assimilation a survey experiment  n   529  was used to test the moderating effects of intergroup ideologies  assimilation  multiculturalism  and interculturalism  on the relationship between social dominance orientation  sdo  and expressions of prejudice under conditions of intergroup threat  moderated multiple regression analyses suggest a multicultural integration frame moderates the relationship between sdo and feelings toward syrian refugees in canada when the target outgroup is portrayed as a source of intergroup threat  this moderating effect was unique to the relationship between sdo and feelings toward syrians and did not extend to other correlates of prejudice including beliefs in zero sum group competition or a multicultural ideology  nor did it extend to more general measures of prejudice  i e   attitudes toward immigrants or evaluations of intercultural contact   findings suggest the prejudice reducing effects of a multicultural integration narrative affect group evaluations and functions by targeting beliefs in social dominance  rather than zero sum group competition or ideological support for cultural diversity  the results offer insights into the prejudice reducing potential for two alternative integration narratives that are institutionalized in canada  
 three moments of stuart hall in south africa  postcolonial postsocialist marxisms of the future what does it mean to read stuart hall from south africa  in relation to south africa  and with south africa in mind  this paper engages  what s left of the debate  between marxism and postcolonialism as politico theoretical projects by refusing the opposition of compartmentalized scholarly fields  and by positing a conjunctural postcolonial postsocialist praxis necessary for interpreting contemporary south africa  as elsewhere   drawing on hall s notion of moments  as both spatial and temporal  and assembled in the work of representation  i draw together insights from three moments in hall s work  his foundational essay for the apartheid predicament   race  articulation and societies structured in dominance   the collectively written policing the crisis and particularly its remarkable conclusion which speaks to the criminalization of poor people s struggles  and his later thoughts on  the end of innocence  with respect to coalitional black politics  reflecting on aspects of my research on 20th century durban  i suggest why these three moments must be seen in relation to each other  as a constellation that points  through the legacies of the black radical tradition  to as yet unnamed postcolonial postsocialist marxisms of the future

 to compare is to despair  a population wide study of neighborhood composition and suicide in stockholm neighborhood context can change the effect of a socio demographic attribute on the risk of suicide  eight hypotheses about the interactions between neighborhood composition  ethnicity  income  and socially disadvantaged propositions are proposed based on social support  social comparison  and social regulation mechanisms  they are tested with a population based dataset of all adults  1 4 million  who lived in the greater stockholm area in the 1990s  on one hand  multi level analysis shows that suicide risk increases with the level of affluence in one s neighborhood  particularly among individuals with low income  this supports the notion that income comparison can have negative consequences  on the other hand  social welfare recipients are less likely to commit suicide when there are other social welfare recipients in the neighborhood  suicide risk among immigrants decreases with the proportion of co ethnics in the neighborhood  confirming previous findings on social support and suicide  however  further analyses show that the protection effect of having co ethnic neighbors is limited to immigrants from countries with low suicide rates  this study shows that administrative data can be used to examine neighborhood effects on rare outcomes  the findings are relevant to the contemporary trends towards rising income inequality and ethnic diversity  
 to see or not to see  talent identification in the swedish football association the purpose of this article is to explore whether context and coaching cultures influence coaches  practical experience and their unarticulated and embodied knowledge  and thus their different ways of seeing and defining talent  using a cultural sociological perspective  we challenge the commonly held assumption that talent identification is  or can be made into  a rational and objective process  our interpretations and analyses are based upon interviews with 15 soccer coaches in four districts within the swedish football association s talent organization program  the results imply that coaches  talent identification is guided by what feels  right in the heart and stomach   but what feels right is greatly influenced by their experience of previous identifications  interpretations of what elite soccer entails  and the coaching culture in which they find themselves  
 tolerance within community  does social capital affect tolerance  tolerance is valuable in the development of any u s  community  individuals of varying religious beliefs  political leanings  and sexual orientations constitute communities  these differences can create unwanted divisions within the community if tolerance is not present  examining through the framework of social capital theory  specifically civic engagement and social embeddedness  the present study seeks to understand what impacts an individual to be more tolerant of others  in the current study  tolerance is a broad measure that combines various types of individual characteristics into one dependent variable  including tolerance levels of different races  religious beliefs  and sexual orientations  using independent measures of social capital in the form of civic engagement and social embeddedness  the study expects those individuals who have more instances of civic engagement and social embeddedness will be more tolerant of others compared to those with no or low levels of either civic engagement or social embeddedness  
 too much of a good thing  economic growth and human rights  1960 to 2010 despite widespread belief in the benefits of economic growth  some scholars emphasize the potentially negative consequences of growth and especially rapid growth for social and political outcomes  using data for 149 countries between 1960 and 2010  i analyze the effect of economic growth on fundamental human rights conditions  dynamic random effects and two way fixed effects estimators  both with and without instrumental variables  yield several conclusions  first  economic growth is causally prior to rights conditions  second  economic growth has a modest positive effect on human rights  albeit with diminishing returns at high growth rates  third  low income countries account for much of this relationship  growth improves rights conditions for most low income countries  but extremely rapid growth is inimical  growth has little effect among middle income countries  while for high income countries the relationship is positive but not robust  i bring these findings to bear on long standing debates between proponents and critics of modernization theory   c  2017 elsevier inc  all rights reserved

 tracing protest motives  the link between newspaper coverage  movement messages  and demonstrators  reasons to protest within the social movement literature  it is mostly assumed that the reasons why people join a protest demonstration are in line with the collective action frames of the organizations staging the protest  some recent studies suggest  however  that protesters  motives are only partly aligned with the messages that are broadcasted by social movements  this study argues that activists  motives are for an important part shaped by mass media coverage on the protest issue  it investigates the link between people s reasons to protest  the campaign messages of the protest organizers  and newspaper coverage prior to the demonstration  data cover 14 anti austerity demonstrations in belgium  the netherlands  and the united kingdom  results show that social movements depend a lot on other political actors to gain media visibility for their messages  furthermore  the relationship between social movement frames and protest participant motives is mediated by newspaper coverage  protest organizers  are able to reach demonstrators via their own communication channels to some extent  but for many of their messages  they also rely on journalists  reporting about the protest issue  
 trading equality for health  evaluating the trade off and institutional hypotheses on health inequalities in the global south it has been suggested that as medicine advances and mortality declines  socioeconomic disparities in health outcomes will grow  yet  most research on this topic uses data from affluent western democracies  where mortality is declining in small increments  we argue that the global south represents the ideal setting to study this issue in a context of rapid mortality decline  we evaluate two competing hypotheses   1  there is a trade off between population health and health inequality such that reductions in under five mortality are linked to higher levels of social inequality in health  and  2  institutional interventions that improve under five mortality  like the expansion of educational systems and public health expenditure  are associated with reductions in inequalities  we test these hypotheses using data on 1 369 050 births in 34 low income countries in the demographic and health surveys from 1995 to 2012  the results show little evidence of a health for equality trade off and instead support the institutional hypothesis  
 traditional plant knowledge in the white carpathians  ethnobotany of wild food plants and crop wild relatives in the czech republic this ethnobotanical study documents wild food plant use in the white carpathians in the czech republic  a bio culturally preserved mountain range adjacent to the border with slovakia  sixty informants from 25 villages were interviewed  and 78 species of wild plant from 30 botanical families were recorded  crop wild relatives were of high cultural importance  demonstrating their unambiguous role in the traditional food system  based on cross cultural comparisons  the highest degree of similarity for species  genera  and uses was found with ukrainians living in romania  the greatest number of species was collected in anthropogenic environments  however  species with higher cultural importance occur in forests and meadows  the consumption of impatiens parviflora seeds  sambucus nigra green flower buds  and the sucking of ajuga reptans nectar are novel findings for european ethnobotany  the results reinforce the idea that operating through social memory biocultural refugia safeguard important reservoirs of traditional ecological knowledge  
 transition from the military into civilian life  an exploration of cultural competence in this article  we employ the theoretical framework and concepts of pierre bourdieu to examine the notion of  transition  from military to civilian life for u k  armed forces personnel  we put bourdieu s concepts of habitus  capital  and field to work in highlighting key differences between military and civilian life  the use of social theory allows us to describe the cultural legacy of military life and how this may influence the posttransition course of veterans  lives  there may be positive and negative transition outcomes for service personnel when moving into civilian life  and by applying bourdieu s theoretical concepts  we explain how such outcomes can be understood  we suggest that the  rules  are different in military environments compared to civilian ones and that service personnel must navigate a complex cultural transition when moving between environments  there are numerous and significant implications including policy applications from understanding transition through a bourdieusian lens  and these are highlighted throughout  
 transnational alternative policy groups in global civil society  enablers of post capitalist alternatives or carriers of ngoization  since the 1970s  transnational alternative policy groups  tapgs  have generated visions and strategies pointing to alternatives to capitalist globalization  however  tapgs are also embedded in networks of intergovernmental organizations  igos  and foundations  and may thus be subject to ngoization  this article examines two bodies of data relevant to this issue   1  network data that highlight tapgs  links to major sources of funds as well as key igos   2  reflections of tapg protagonists gleaned from in depth interviews conducted at these groups  while our network analysis is consistent with the ngoization narrative  and while our participants offered many narratives of their own in line with it  they also provided more nuanced accounts that begin to specify the contingencies mediating between  on the one hand  resort to formal organization and to working with igos and foundations  and on the other hand  descent into hegemonic incorporation  in a neoliberal political   economic environment  the future of counter hegemonic politics hinges partly on our identifying how  preventative measures  can be brought to bear on processes of ngoization

 trump s electoral speeches and his appeal to the american white working class this paper contributes to the study of social change by considering boundary work as a dimension of cultural change  drawing on the computer assisted qualitative analysis of 73 formal speeches made by donald trump during the 2016 electoral campaign  we argue that his political rhetoric  which led to his presidential victory  addressed the white working class s concern with their declining position in the national pecking order  he addressed this group s concern by raising their moral status  that is  by  1  emphatically describing them as hard working americans who are victims of globalization   2  voicing their concerns about people above   professionals  the rich  and politicians    3  drawing strong moral boundaries toward undocumented immigrants  refugees  and muslims   4  presenting african americans and  legal  hispanic americans as workers who also deserve jobs   5  stressing the role of working class men as protectors of women and lgbtq people  this particular case study of the role of boundary work in political rhetoric provides a novel  distinctively sociological approach for capturing dynamics of social change  
 twenty five years of materialism  do the us and europe diverge  using data from the world values survey and the european values study  we compare the trends of materialism over the last quarter of century among the us and six major european countries  france  spain  italy  germany  great britain and sweden  we use the definition of materialism adopted by positive psychologists  we find that the trends in europe and in the us diverged  in the us materialism increased  while in europe it decreased  however  some mixed patterns arise  in particular  great britain  spain and sweden showed some symptoms of an increase of materialistic values  although they were far less pronounced compared to the american ones  as far as the levels of materialism are concerned  it is interesting that  according to most of our measures  americans were relatively less materialistic at the beginning of our period of observation  yet  towards the end of the period they scored very high in the ranking of materialism in our sample of countries  
 two regimes of hiv aids  the mmwr and the socio political construction of hiv aids as a  black disease  over the course of the hiv aids epidemic  black americans have become a central target of us public health prevention efforts  and today  hiv aids is understood to disproportionately affect black americans  this markedly contrasts with knowledge about the disease and efforts to prevent it in the first decade of the epidemic in the us  when expert and lay understandings and responses centred on white gay males  this article demonstrates that explaining these historical reversals as purely reflective of epidemiological data   or best knowledge available   is insufficient  drawing on the concept disease regimes and utilising a discursive analysis of epidemiological results and editorial commentary published from 1981 to 1994 in the morbidity and mortality weekly reports  mmwr   this article argues for a socio political explanation for the changing colour of hiv aids  that is  it scrutinises institutional and discursive practices that within the hiv aids prevention field and disease discourse constituted a regime of black american exclusion   1981 1992  and a regime of black american inclusion  1993 present day   
 u suk  participatory media and youth experiences with political discourse in light of evidence that the internet  participatory media  and online communities are increasingly central to civic and political life  this article investigates online political discourse as a context of youth civic development  drawing on a national survey of 2 519 youth  ages 15 to 24  we find that exposure to conflict in online discourse is common  nearly half of youth report witnessing conflict online  although fewer participate directly in these exchanges  we find that youth who are most involved in online political discussions or who get news through online participatory media are more likely to encounter such conflict  in addition  experiences with conflict vary by type of online community  greater involvement in interest driven online communities is associated with greater involvement in online conflict  while involvement in friendship driven communities is not  finally  we examine youths  normative reactions to online conflict and discuss implications for youth civic engagement and development  
 ultimatum bargaining over losses and gains   an experimental comparison subjects in the loss domain tend to split payoffs equally when bargaining  the ultimatum game offers an ideal mechanism through which social scientists can investigate whether equal splits are the consequence of the proposers  generosity or due to their anticipation that the responders will reject lower offers  this paper experimentally compares ultimatum bargaining that takes place in a loss domain with that under a gains domain  the results reveal that  although responders do not expect more in the loss domain  proposers do make higher offers  as such  proposers reach agreements more often in the loss domain than they do in the gains domain  and responders receive higher payoffs   c  2017 elsevier inc  all rights reserved  
 uncommon ground  the role of different place attachments in explaining community renewable energy projects for rural communities  energy projects can provide a host of benefits  and yet also be a source of significant conflict  place attachment has become an increasingly popular concept for understanding local responses to large scale renewable energy installations  however  there has been significantly less attention paid to how place attachment influences local responses to community led developments  this study contributes to the body of research on place attachment by examining its role in shaping opinions on two locally initiated projects  interviews were conducted with residents in two rural communities in the scottish highlands  where community organisations are developing renewable energy projects  the findings show that place attachment was an important motivator for the development of these projects  but that different types of place attachment also formed a key source of disagreement  finally  the implications of these findings for rural communities engaging in community led development initiatives will be discussed  
 uncovering longitudinal life narratives  scrolling back on facebook this article explores the potential role of sustained social media use in longitudinal qualitative research  we introduce the research design and methodology of a research project exploring sustained use  five or more years  of the social network site facebook among young people in their twenties  by focusing on this group  we seek to uncover how growing up  stories are told and archived online  and how disclosure practices  what people say and share on social media  change over time  we question how we can understand the digital trace  inscribed through the facebook timeline as a longitudinal narrative text  we argue that scrolling back  through facebook with participants as co analysts  of their own digital traces can add to the qualitative longitudinal research  qlr  tradition  qlr and the scroll back method attend to a similar set of concerns around change over time  the depth of inquiry  and uncovering rigorous  rich life narratives  we explore limitations  especially around intentionality  and ethical challenges  while also arguing for the inclusion of these often highly personal  deep  co constructed digital texts in qualitative longitudinal research  we also consider how the scroll back method could apply to other digital media  as the sites and applications that people use diversifies and changes over time  
 understanding environmental risk perceptions  a case of contested illness in south florida communities facing environmental health threats can experience contention when residents have conflicting interpretations of risks  yet little is known about the social psychological processes that contribute to divergent risk perceptions in these cases  drawing on previous work on environmental contamination  contested illness  and literature on risk perceptions  we offer a framework for analyzing how residents assess potential environmental risks  using the case of the acreage  florida  we examine a community where a cancer cluster has been established  but an environmental cause has not been determined  specifically  we ask how residents individually assess risks concerning possible environmental contamination in cases of contested illness  data come from 57 in depth interviews conducted with current and former residents of the acreage  we argue that residents utilized particular cognitive heuristics to develop understandings and assessments of the situation  however  when these assessments contradicted those of other residents  community conflict emerged  we conclude by discussing how the framework utilized in our analysis can be applied in future research of contaminated communities  
 understanding individual level change through the basis functions of a latent curve model latent curve models have become a popular approach to the analysis of longitudinal data  at the individual level  the model expresses an individual s response as a linear combination of what are called basis functions that are common to all members of a population and weights that may vary among individuals  this article uses differential calculus to define the basis functions of a latent curve model  this provides a meaningful interpretation of the unique and dynamic impact of each basis function on the individual level response  examples are provided to illustrate this sensitivity  as well as the sensitivity of the basis functions  to changes in the measure of time  
 understanding intergenerational transmission of deprivation in spain  education and marital sorting this paper contributes to the literature on intergenerational transmission of deprivation in spain by exploring how this phenomenon is shaped by education and marital homogamy  to that aim  a set of univariate  bivariate and trivariate ordered probit models are estimated on a sample of spanish born individuals from the module on intergenerational transmission of disadvantages in the spanish survey on living conditions 2011  we split the sample into two age groups  30 39 and 40 49 year olds   and find similar levels of intergenerational transmission of deprivation amongst younger cohorts despite their higher educational mobility  education is more relevant as a channel for the transmission of disadvantages across generations in the younger subsample than in the elder one  marital sorting has a more relevant impact on the transmission of social disadvantage in the younger group  finally  in the elder subsample  there seems to be a more genuine  beyond the observed transmission channels  transmission of  dis   advantage  while in the younger subsample  the observed transmission channels seem to fully explain the inheritance of the risk for material deprivation  
 understanding power in indigenous protected areas  the case of the tla o qui aht tribal parks this article draws on concepts of power from political ecology and political sociology to describe the ways that the tla o qui aht first nation  a canadian indigenous people  have attempted to realize their goals under the broad rubric of their tribal parks initiative  like some other indigenous peoples  and community conserved territories and areas  iccas   the tribal parks example features de facto legal pluralism  lack of clear tenure and or legal recognition  oppositional and or cooperative relationships with other actors  and situations where local actors are influenced by intersecting global discourses on conservation and indigenous rights and culture  globally  iccas are a form of protected area and are potentially critical in terms of meeting ambitious global protected area targets as well in addressing issues related to the rights and well being of indigenous peoples  as such  understanding the  customary law or other effective means   or the dynamics of power through which indigenous groups are able  or not  to realize their protected area goals is of global significance  this article illuminates the contours of power through two specific tribal parks case studies  the first involves contestations over industrial logging  while the second focuses on the establishment and implementation of what came to be called an  ecosystem services fee  paid by ecotourism outfitters operating within a tribal park  results highlight that the tla o qui aht have drawn power from different sources and exercised it by different means including turning to the courts in a context of legal uncertainty  protest and direct action coupled with appeals to public opinion  developing and drawing on relationships with both local and non local interests  and by strategically  tapping into  prominent discourses  
 understanding the antecedents of adverse peer relationships among early adolescents in the united states  an ecological systems analysis this study examines ecological level correlates of adverse peer relationships among early adolescents  ages 12 14   data analysis was conducted using the national longitudinal survey of youth  nlsy   the sample was drawn from the mother child data set  which included youth who in 2002 or 2004 were living with their mothers and enrolled in school  eligible participants responded to at least 1 of the 13 items from the survey and their mothers responded to at least 1 of the 2 items measuring adverse peer relationships at times 1  2002 2004  and 2  2004 2006   multivariate hierarchical logistic regression was estimated  the presence of a learning disorder and adverse peer relationships at time 1  socio demographics   perceptions of school environment  microsystem   and area of residence and perceptions of safety  exosystem  were all significantly associated with adverse peer relationships at time 2  assessing and targeting these ecological levels hold the potential to decrease adverse peer relationships among early adolescents  
 understanding the hong kong umbrella movement  a critical discourse historiographical approach within the context of a critical discourse historiographical  cdh  approach to critical discourse studies  cds   this article applies a range of theories to the hong kong umbrella movement  or hong kong occupy movement  to understand it as a discursive event  the cdh approach argues that a diachronic  historiographical approach can contribute to historiography  the writing of history  in that it can create first readings and interpretations of important events  the approach focuses on critical moments in discourse  of which the hong kong umbrella movement is considered an important one in the context of hong kong s ongoing socio historical development  four theories are applied  in addition to the historical analysis  to further interpret the hong kong umbrella movement phenomenon  social movement theory  performance theory  identity theory and social action as text theory  it is concluded that the cdh approach to cds and findings of the study may be useful in the consideration of other social movements and occupy movements globally  
 understanding the kuznets process an empirical investigation of income inequality in china  1978 2011 this paper investigates income inequality in post reform china using both national time series and provincial panel data from 1978 to 2011  we identify a kuznets inverted u relationship between economic development and income inequality and show that this relationship was driven by the process of urbanization  we estimate that the kuznets turning point occurred in the mid 1980s  and argue that increased urbanization after the mid 1980s had the effect of narrowing income inequality but its effect was more than offset by other factors  in particular  we found that low productivity in agriculture relative to that of the economy as a whole  i e   dualism  and inflation were significant contributing factors to income inequality  we also present evidence to suggest that secondary education and higher education may have different effects on income inequality at the national level and at the provincial level  
 understanding the organization of sharing economy in agri food systems  evidence from alternative food networks in valencia despite the proliferation of sharing economy initiatives in agri food systems  the recent literature has still not unravelled what sharing exactly entails from an organizational standpoint  in light of this knowledge gap  this study aims to understand which resources are shared  and how  in a heterogeneous set of sharing economy initiatives in the context of food and agriculture  specifically  this study compares the organization of various forms of alternative food networks  afns   which are recognized to be frugal forms of sharing economy initiatives  i e   locally based  small scale and with limited use of information technology   in terms of leadership  bureaucracy  shared resources and participants  engagement  data from a comparative case study across 18 afns identify five sharing economy models of afns with distinctive shared resources and organizational mechanisms  consumer groups  commercial community gardens  as well as network based  privately owned and publicly owned self consumption community gardens  these models also display notable differences in terms of their origins  participants  goals and constraints which  to some extent  may be associated to the nature of their organization  findings inform policy makers  afns  leaders and stakeholders especially those seeking to support innovative models towards sustainable transitions on how to tailor institutional norms and develop networks to meet the heterogeneous needs of different typologies of sharing economy initiatives in agri food systems  
 understanding the philosophical positions of classical and neopragmatists for mixed methods research pragmatism is the most popular philosophy paradigm in the international field of mixed methods research  mmr   this article therefore introduces  describes  and contrasts the philosophies of the most well known pragmatists  including the three most important classical pragmatists  charles sanders peirce  william james and john dewey  and two neopragmatists  richard rorty and susan haack   it is shown that rorty and james fit well with qualitatively driven mmr  i  e   mmr where the qualitative component of the study is primary   peirce fits well with quantitatively driven mmr  i  e   mmr where the quantitative component is primary   and dewey fits well with mmr that attempts to treat qualitative and quantitative research philosophy equally  i  e   equal status mixed methods research   importantly  it is shown here that pragmatism offers a way out of many philosophy of science quagmires facing social researchers and it offers a promising philosophy for mixed methods research practice  
 unintended birth and children s long term mental health research has examined the proximate effects of unintended birth on infants and young children  but we know relatively little about the longer term effects  given that unintended birth is associated with several childhood risk factors  it might set the stage for poor mental health in adulthood  drawing on rich intergenerational survey data from the national longitudinal survey of youth  1979  n   3 742   this study used a variety of statistical techniques to examine whether maternal pregnancy intentions are associated with children s depressive symptoms during early adulthood  results from ordinary least squares regression suggest that children resulting from unintended pregnancies experienced more depressive symptoms in their 20s than children resulting from intended pregnancies  controlling for a host of characteristics  results from propensity weighted and sibling fixed effects models suggest that there is little to no causal relationship  however  much of the initial association between maternal fertility intentions and children s depressive symptoms is attributed to the mother s sociodemographic characteristics  
 united nations  uniting nations  international support cues and american attitudes on environmental sustainability objective  we ask whether framing u n  actions in terms of institutional origins or multilateral support has differential effects on attitudes toward environmental sustainability policy  methods  a survey experiment exposed individuals to different descriptions of u n  agenda 21  a 1992 sustainable development policy document  results  individuals who learned about agenda 21 in terms of the international consensus behind the document at its inception were significantly more likely to support it and find it important  conservative individuals who learned agenda 21 was a u n  document were significantly less likely to believe it was important and to want the federal government to incentivize implementation  conclusions  framing u n  action in terms of international consensus may be a gateway toward building support among americans in general  framing u n  action in terms of the institution behind the action has little effect on opinion  except in some instances when it turns conservatives against said action  
 unpacking heat  dueling identities and complex views on gun control among rural police using 20 semistructured interviews with police officers from a rural sheriff s department  we present what we believe is the first in depth examination of u s  rural officers  views on gun control  we find that officers possess complex views about gun control  reflecting their multiple identities as both gun oriented rural citizens and police who seek to control the situations they encounter at work  specifically  we observed that rural police officers   1  embrace a rural identity that implies support of gun rights over gun control   2  report that police work experiences have caused them to embrace their police identity and to distance themselves from some gun related aspects of rural identity  e g   they have lost interest in guns over time and have increasingly dissociated from gun enthusiast peers   and  3  have learned to incorporate aspects of both identities into their views on gun control  universally advocating for some gun control measures in the name of community safety  but rejecting others as part of rural ideological views about personal freedom  we discuss research and policy implications and suggest that policymakers must better appreciate the nuances and culture of rural places in order to gain rural citizens  and rural police officers  support for gun control legislation  
 ups and downs of art commerce  narratives of  crisis  in the contemporary art markets of russia and india this article develops an analytical framework to study the role of narratives in markets and argues that there is a relationship between the structure and composition of narratives produced by market actors and market dynamics  with respect to theory  the article bridges the perspectives that study markets as cultures and as fields and draws from the organizational studies approach to the analysis of narratives  two empirical cases of the crises narratives in the emerging contemporary art markets of russia and india illustrate the use of the framework  the analysis is based on in depth interviews with artists and art dealers as well as observations in moscow  saint petersburg  new delhi  and mumbai conducted between april 2012 and june 2013  the article shows that there is a widely shared crisis narrative with a coherent structure in the indian art market  in contrast  fragmented and contested stories that lack narrative structure dominate in the russian art market  the analysis of the first case highlights the narrative structure and shows the productive work it does in the indian market it provides a moral justification of existing market norms and produces a perspective for the future  the analysis of the second case focuses on the context of narrative production and connects the conflicting interpretations of the crisis in the russian art market to contested hierarchies and persistent uncertainty  
 using a social science fictional play to teach about global capitalism and macro structural systems in introduction to sociology this article explores the use of a social science fictional play to teach macro structural concepts related to global capitalism and surplus labor in a small and large introduction to sociology course  relying on a cross disciplinary and critical pedagogical approach that combines theory and practice to empower students to develop a critical consciousness of the world around them  the authors develop an active learning exercise centered on an in class reading of the dystopian play i like firing people written by sociologists charles derber and yale magrass  to assess the effectiveness of the exercise to increase student engagement and conceptual learning  the authors use quantitative and qualitative data and a quasi experimental research design  even with the mixed findings  the reading of an evocative social scientific fictional play coupled with short writing exercises and class discussions appears to assist in making macro structural systems more visible and real to students and offers a unique role playing opportunity that highlights multiple perspectives on the global capitalist economy  
 using asynchronous written online communications for qualitative inquiries  a research note qualitative online inquiries are being used more and more but their use has been little methodologically refined so far  this is already true for a systematic differentiation between asynchronous synchronous and oral written varieties of communication and their specific benefits when we use them as qualitative research instruments  in this note  we focus on the methodological benefits of asynchronous online communication between absent communication partners with a time lag  before doing so  we discriminate between synchrony and asynchrony in  human  social interaction and arrange them on a continuum of decreasing action cues and conceptual speech elements  
 using conceptual depth criteria  addressing the challenge of reaching saturation in qualitative research saturation remains a problematic concept within the field of qualitative research  particularly with regard to issues of definition and process  this article sets out some of the common problems with saturation and  with reference to one research study  assesses the value of adopting a range of  conceptual depth criteria  to address problems of definition and process when seeking to establish saturation within a grounded theory approach  it is suggested that the criteria can act as a test to measure the progress of the theoretical sampling and thus ascertain the readiness of the research for the final analytical stages and theory building  moreover  the application of  conceptual depth criteria  provides the researcher with an evaluative framework and a tool for producing a structured evidence base to substantiate choices made during the theoretical sampling process  
 using go alongs for exploring immigrant entrepreneurs  native customers the purpose of this article is to evaluate the methodological practice of go alongs for exploring immigrant entrepreneurs  native customers  a barely developed subfield within immigrant business research  through accompanying individuals on outings in their familiar environments  go alongs as a qualitative data collection method are used to gain access to practices  experiences and interpretations of individuals in their everyday routines  drawing on current qualitative research on native customers in immigrant grocery shops in vienna  the article demonstrates how go alongs can be used for exploring consumption practices and patterns of interethnic interaction in this specific setting  what becomes apparent is that go alongs provide an opportunity to gain access to reflexive aspects of lived experience in situ  in the present case expressed by spontaneous and emotional comments when the shop  ethnic products or interethnic interactions are commented on and evaluated  moreover  go alongs allow insights into modes of self expression  however  go alongs have limitations as they cannot capture consumption practices beyond the limited time and space of shopping  furthermore  they do not fully provide access to narratives and discourses  therefore  go alongs are most useful in combination with in depth interviews  
 using internet search data to produce state level measures  the case of tea party mobilization this study proposes using internet search data from search engines like google to produce state level metrics that are useful in social science research  generally  state level research relies on demographic statistics  official statistics produced by government agencies  or aggregated survey data  however  each of these data sources has serious limitations in terms of both the availability of the data and its ability to capture important concepts  this study demonstrates how state level google search measures can be produced and then demonstrates the effectiveness of such measures in an empirical case  predicting state level tea party movement mobilization  drawing on existing studies of the tea party movement and theories of right wing and conservative mobilization  state level google search measures for anti immigrant sentiment and economic distress are developed and compared to traditional metrics that are typically used to measure these concepts  such as the unemployment rate and the international immigration rate in their ability to successfully predict tea party event counts  the results show that the google search measures are effective in predicting tea party mobilization in a way that is consistent with existing theory  while the traditional measures are not  
 using vpi to measure poverty stricken villages in china revealing the comprehensive poverty levels and spatial diversities of poverty stricken villages is a prerequisite for  entire village advancement  anti poverty policy of china  in response  we build a multidimensional poverty assessment model from the perspective of spatial poverty  adopting vpi  village level poverty index  to examine multiscale and multidimensional situations and characteristics of poverty stricken villages in rural china  then adopting spatial geostatistics to explore their multidimensional and multiscale spatial point pattern distribution  further  we also introduce lse model to examine their poverty types  our tests show that  firstly  the validity and reliability of the vpi model can be justified in terms of village level targeting ratio and policy coverage ratio  then  the poverty level of poverty stricken villages follows a normal right distribution  presenting an  olive  structure with a shape of  large middle  and small at two ends   poverty levels and poverty sizes of different counties obviously increasing from east to west  and different classifications of counties also representing different poverty levels  on the other hand  there exists three kinds of multi scale poverty clusters among different contiguous destitute areas  namely  clustering randomness dispersion  randomness clustering and dispersion randomness distribution  villages with poverty type of three factor dominance account for over 50   of the total villages  their poverty are mainly caused by harsh geographical environment  disadvantaged production and living conditions  and poor labor forces  this research helps know well about the relationships among different villages from the multiscale and multidimensional views  so as to provide decision basis for optimal development and reorganization of the poverty stricken villages in rural china  which is of vital practical significance to make overall arrangement of rural development oriented poverty elimination and to boost new round of precise poverty elimination and new countryside construction  
 value priorities of younger and older adults in seven european countries this paper addresses the question of whether the value priorities of older and younger adults differ  and if so  whether the pattern of differences is similar in countries with different experience of economic  political and social change  the data from the 2008 wave from ess about responses to a 21 item version of the portrait values questionnaire  pvq  schwartz 2003  were used to compare value priorities in younger  under 30 years  and older adults from five east central european countries estonia  latvia  lithuania  romania  and russia and two relatively stable nordic welfare states finland and sweden  the study found a clear general trend for younger adults toward openness to change and self enhancement on the two value dimensions  age group differences were more pronounced in east central countries  and on conservation openness to change dimension  younger people from different countries had more similar values than older adults in regard to the importance placed on openness to change  the discussion focused on possible reasons of the findings such as the different effect of societal change on value priorities of people from different age groups  
 valued elders or societal burden  cross national attitudes toward older adults population aging is a nearly universal trend that is placing new importance on how societies view and treat their elderly  past research has established that perceptions of the elderly vary across countries  this article empirically explores three competing theoretical explanations on potential reasons for these differences  the value orientation perspective  the competition over resources perspective  and political and economic structure  using wave 6 of the world values survey  various sources of country level data  and hierarchical logistic regressions the article provides insights as to which theoretical position holds the most weight  the analysis improves on past research by using a large and diverse sample of countries from every region of the world  contrary to popular thought  and the traditional value orientation perspective  it is found that asian  middle eastern  and sub saharan african countries have significantly more negative views toward the elderly than western countries  in addition  the study finds that countries with higher average lifespans and more elderly as a proportion of the total population actually have more favorable attitudes toward the elderly  
 values mapping and counter mapping in contested landscapes  an olympic peninsula  usa  case study indigenous peoples  local communities  and other groups can use counter mapping to make land claims  identify areas of desired access  or convey cultural values that diverge from the dominant paradigm  while sometimes created independently  counter maps also can be formulated during public participation mapping events sponsored by natural resource planning agencies  public participation mapping elicits values  uses  and meanings of landscapes from diverse stakeholders  yet individuals and advocacy groups can use the mapping process as an opportunity to make visible strongly held values and viewpoints  we present three cases from the olympic peninsula in washington state to illustrate how stakeholders intentionally used landscape values mapping workshops to amplify their perspectives in attempts to further political outcomes  we combine geospatial analysis with qualitative data to explore ways that landscape values mapping were used as a political tool and how social scientists engaged in similar efforts can defend the scientific integrity of results  
 values on paper  in the head  and in action  on max weber and value freedom today this article starts out with a summary of weber s views on value freedom  by emphasizing   1  that value freedom constitutes a special constellation of values  and  2  that value freedom makes it possible for the social scientist to theorize on the basis of new and more extensive knowledge than if she had simply stated her own values and focused the analysis around these  the latter point emerges most clearly in weber s instructions for how a social scientist should proceed when carrying out an analysis of her own preferred social policy  after the section on weber s views on value freedom  an attempt is made to update his views  this is done by arguing that the impact of values  and value freedom  differs  depending on where these can be found  on paper  in the head of the social scientist  or in her actions  actions  in the context of value freedom  refer to the research process and especially to the element of theorizing  value freedom helps to guide the research into new and fruitful directions and to steer it clear of propaganda  
 values within reason the paper questions the assumptions that facts and values are always radically different  that objectivity and values do not mix  and that values are subjective and a rational and should be excluded from social science  it argues  1  that such assumptions are underpinned by unnoticed slippages between different meanings of objectivity and by misunderstandings of the nature of values and normativity   2  that evaluative judgmentsoften in the form of thick ethical concepts in which description and evaluation are fusedare necessary for objective description in social science  and  3  that framing the values issue in terms of the relations between is and ought misrepresents the place of normativity in social science and in everyday life  
 verification of self using a mathematical theory of identity  feeling  and behavior the current study tests the affect control theory of self  a mathematical theory that demonstrates a core social psychological principle  individuals strive for a stable and coherent self through identity selection and behavior  in the affect control theory of self  the self is conceptualized as self sentiments  which are measured on three dimensions  evaluation  good bad   potency  powerful powerless   and activity  fast slow   in a longitudinal sample of college men and women  i find the self sentiment predicts how individuals describe themselves on a range of terms  including primary emotions and both stigmatized and esteemed traits related to mental illness and self esteem  it also predicts various productive and deviant behaviors five months later  thus  the current study demonstrates the theoretical precision of the theory  its ability for understanding human behavior  and its potential for identifying at risk individuals

 vocational identity development among unaccompanied refugee minors this study examined educational aspirations and vocational identity formation among unaccompanied refugees in norway  in phase 1 we employed questionnaire data from 918 unaccompanied refugees to investigate the effects of demographic information  pre migration trauma  mental health and acculturation related factors on their educational aspirations  in phase 2  data from identity status interviews  isi  with 29 participants was analyzed to obtain information about vocational identity status distribution and to examine core themes and contextual factors underlying their vocational choices  the findings from phase 1 showed that none of the theoretically and empirically based included variables had a significant effect on their aspirations  moreover  the overall regression model was non significant  we discussed these findings in relation to the strong motivation among unaccompanied minors to create better lives for themselves than they could have in the countries they fled from  irrespective of their traumatic experiences and mental health problems  in phase 2 the most important themes emerging from the isis revolved around age  time  and economics  the remedial education to bridge the pre flight gap in formal education meant that the unaccompanied refugee youth entered upper secondary school at substantially older ages than their classmates  their older ages then led them to prioritize economic considerations in making vocational choices  since the support from the child welfare services is discontinued when they reach the age of majority  consequently  most of them chose short vocational paths toward earning a living  rather than complex roads that led to the realization of their own long term aspirations  this may have limited the social mobility of unaccompanied refugees  
 voters  perceptions of party platforms  the role of changing information contexts objectives  under what circumstances are voters most likely to correctly situate political parties along a left right spatial continuum  answering this question is profoundly important for our understanding of the spatial theory of party competition  which has typically generated empirically verifiable predictions about party level platform shifts  but fallen short when it comes to making predictions about voter level perceptions  method  we use a multilevel cross national database of hundreds of thousands of voters in recent elections in western and eastern european democracies  and hierarchical linear modeling to test our hypotheses  results  we demonstrate that the prevalence of internet usage in a country systematically shapes individual voters  objective accuracy in their placements of parties  platforms on the left right spectrum  however  these effects accrue differently across certain populations of voters  conclusion  the party placements of those individuals who self report as being ideologically extreme are affected more substantially by internet prevalence than those of moderate voters  
 wanting to work  managing the sick role in high stake sickness insurance meetings this article respecifies and develops parsons s sick role theory  focusing on the postulate that the sick person must want  to get well  using conversation analysis and discursive psychology to study how the psychological term want  is used in high stake  multi professional meetings with sickness benefit claimants in sweden  the article shows how establishing that one wants  to get well requires extensive interactional work  in the examined meetings  the sick person s want  formulations make explicit the relationship between wants  and illness or inabilities  thus allowing for motivational character to be established without committing to its implications  and without appearing strategic or biased  by contrast  professional parties in the meetings invoke the sick person s wants  either to hold them accountable  or for establishing a desired course of recovery  confirming the centrality of such wants  in this setting as well as the risks associated with expressing them  the article suggests that analysing psychological matters as they are oriented to by participants renders sick role theory relevant for a wide range of settings and respecifies criticism of the model  
 war exposed newcomer adolescent immigrants facing daily life stressors in the united states for adolescents new to the united states  the experience of war and acculturative stressors may play complex roles during early stages of adjustment to a new culture and country  the overall purpose of this study was to deepen understanding of the experiences of adolescents who are new to the united states  also called  newcomers   through the examination of pre migration war exposure and post migration acculturative stressors as predictors of psychosocial adjustment and academic achievement  the study sample included newcomer immigrant and refugee youth  n   184   with an average of 3 5 years in the united states  triangulated data were collected from youth  teachers  and official school records  results indicated that the participants who were exposed to war  n   57  experienced more self reported and teacher reported anxiety  more self reported conduct problems  and had lower academic achievement than participants who had not been exposed to war  acculturative stressors also predicted more self reported anxiety  conduct problems  and lower academic achievement  but only for those adolescents without war exposure  suggesting that exposure to traumatic events like war may change newcomer adolescents  response to acculturative stressors  this may be related to the development of coping or growth that follows after trauma  which enable youth to navigate other life challenges  understanding potential risk and resilience associated with war exposure among newly arrived students can assist clinicians  educators  and researchers in creating solutions to difficulties in psychosocial adjustment and academic performance   c  2017 elsevier ltd  all rights reserved  
 watching the news and support for democracy  why media systems matter objective  we explore whether the effect of watching television on support for democracy is contingent on the type of media system  in countries with well developed public broadcasting systems  watching television news should enhance support for democracy  in more market oriented systems with more superficial and episodic news content  watching television news should weaken democratic attachments  methods  we utilize wave 6 of the world values survey to investigate the relationship between watching television news and support for democracy in the united states  germany  sweden  and the netherlands  results  watching television news in public broadcasting systems increases the importance one places on living in a democracy and evaluations of democratic governance  watching television news in market oriented systems increases support for authoritarian political systems  conclusion  the effect of watching television news on democratic attitudes is contingent on media system  public broadcasting systems enhance democratic attitudes while market oriented systems weaken these democratic attachments  
 wearing their chains willingly  athlete burnout and the case of adolescent gaelic footballers in ireland the aim of this article is to challenge the widespread acceptance of player burnout as an athlete s personal inability to deal with the situational demands of sporting competition  adapting coakley s earlier assertion that burnout is a social problem rooted in the social organization of high performance sport itself   the interactions between gaelic athletes and the social world in which they exist are unpacked within an irish context  linking findings to gramsci s theory of hegemony  dominant power relations  within the competitive sport setting are identified and critically analysed  it is argued that gaelic players are exploited within a competitive culture in which they feel entrapped  because their actions are informed by the cultural norms of the gaelic athletic association  the sport s national governing body  and dependent upon relationships with coaches and others in positions of authority in the federation  as such  gaelic footballers are not voluntary agents  somehow acting independently of the constraints of the complex structures in which they compete  instead  and aware of the often very intricate interdependencies that exist within the sport  it is argued that player burnout in gaelic football is best explained through the deployment of a coakley s vocabulary of empowerment   
 welfare state development  individual deprivations and income inequality  a cross country analysis in latin america and the caribbean several scholars have confirmed the role that the welfare state  ws  plays in reducing poverty  promoting equality and ensuring the common wellbeing  one of the limitations of the scholarship has been the conceptualization and operationalization of the ws and poverty as one dimensional variables  the purpose of this paper is to examine the relationship between welfare state development  single dimensions deprivations and income inequality in latin america and the caribbean  before and after controlling for demographic and cyclical factors  the ws is operationalized as a one dimensional variable  but also taking into account its multidimensional nature  three individual deprivations suffered by people on poverty and two income inequality indicators are used as dependent variables  three pooled time series cross section regression analyses with panel corrected standard errors models were carried out on 18 countries in the region around 2000  2005 and 2010  this paper shows that the development of social welfare programs and institutions seems to be an effective way of tackling individual deprivations suffered by people on poverty in the region  on the other hand  the ws development didn t appear to be effective to reduce income inequality  the outcomes of welfare institutions appear to be the pivotal dimension to reduce income inequality and income deprivations in the region  
 what are you doing on tinder  impression management on a matchmaking mobile app mobile dating applications such as tinder have exploded in popularity in recent years  on tinder  impression management begins with a motivation to download the app  the choice of one s profile photos and an assessment of the expectations of potential tinder matches  these processes occur in a technologically mediated environment of reduced cues and increased control  local proximity and a reduced filtering process  my focus in this paper is this first stage of impression management  which consists of both impression motivation and impression construction  specifically  what are the pre match impression management practices of tinder users  i present the results of interviews with tinder users in the netherlands  participants were recruited via a tinder profile that advertised the study using the university emblem and a brief description  interview questions focused on user understandings of self presentation practices and profile construction  the interviews also examined how users evaluated their potential matches  results show users  motivations for using tinder range from entertainment to ego boost to relationship seeking  and these motivations sometimes change over time  profile photos are selected in an attempt to present an ideal yet authentic self  and chosen as an illustration of not only one s desirability but also of other indicators such as education level  tinder users swipe  not only in search of people they like  but also for clues as to how to present themselves in order to attract others like them  this research offers insight into user experiences and perceptions within the still under researched area of inquiry  
 what is  needed  to keep remembering  war specific communication  parental exemplar behaviour and participation in national commemorations given the abundance of literature on collective memory practices  there is relatively little empirical research on the socialization processes explaining the transmission of such practices  this article examines to what extent war specific communication and parental exemplar behaviour function as a link between the collected memories of individuals and society s collective memory  utilizing data from an online survey conducted in 2014  we focus on participation in the activities organized on remembrance day and liberation day in the netherlands in remembrance of the second world war  we distinguish between public and private practices  our findings highlight that different forms of socialization substitute for one another  whereas communication with non relatives is particularly relevant for those communicating less frequently with parents about past war experiences  parental exemplar behaviour  such as participating in the two minute silence on remembrance day  plays a bigger role amongst those with lower levels of communication with either relatives or non relatives  
 what is and what may never be  economic voting in developing democracies objective  we propose and test a theory that media freedom determines the extent of economic voting in developing democracies  methods  building on extant work that suggests economic voting takes place in developing democracies much like it does in established democracies  lewis beck and stegmaier  2008   we test our theory using a new collection of aggregate data from elections in 22 developing democracies in africa results  media freedom rather than political freedom may be a bigger determinant of economic voting in developing democracies  moreover  the threshold of political development needed for economic voting is lower than previously suggested by the literature  conclusion  economic voting is alive and well in developing democracies even those with relatively low levels of economic and political development  
 what is populism and how to explore it  populism has been vastly present in croatian public discourse  however  this is not the case with scientific discourse in which this relevant phenomenon remained for the most part neglected  aspiring to encourage scientific curiosity about populism in croatia  this paper provides an overview and a synthesis of the most important insights about populism from contemporary literature  in doing so it focuses on two main issues  first is the issue of understanding populism while the second is the issue of methodology in researching populism  the authors consider an approach that regards populism as a  thin  political ideology potentially most productive  in the section that discusses methodology  they focus on the problems of conceptualisation and operationalisation in researching populism  the authors advocate a conceptualisation which treats populism as a meta ideology characterized by the simultaneous presence of its two defining features  positive evaluation of the people and diffuse political anti elitism  understanding populism as meta ideology enables hypothesizing about different types of populism  which emerges as one of the most propulsive topics in the future research of populism  
 what parents say and in which way they convey messages about ethnicity to children  children s developmental outcomes are the result of their unique characteristics and different environments they develop in  as well as their interaction  an important part of this interaction is marked by social meaning  attitudes and beliefs about the importance of ethnicity  especially in a multiethnic environment  previous studies were dominantly focused on family functioning and parenting processes in western families  majority groups and middle socioeconomic status  minority families face specific challenges due to their different history  cultural heritage and status in society  thus generalization of the existing results to these families is limited  also  there is a lack of research on family processes that include transmission of messages about group membership  especially in the european area  in this paper we review research about ethnic socialization  i e  parenting in the direction of conveying information  values  beliefs and attitudes related to ethnicity  first  we present the theoretical framework of ethnic socialization and its relationship with parents  and children s characteristics and experiences as well as children s developmental outcomes  second  we consider limitations of the existing research  finally  we discuss the importance of the ethnic socialization research in croatian multiethnic communities along with an overview of the research on ethnic socialization in the ethnically divided city of vukovar  
 what would wittgenstein say about social media  much of the excitement in social media analytics revolves around  a  capturing large scale collections of naturally occurring talk  b  repurposing them as data  and  c  finding ways to speak sociologically about them  researchers have raised concerns over the use of social media data in research  for example  boyd and crawford  2012  housley et al  2014  tinati et al  2014   exploring the ontological and epistemological grounding of the emerging field  we contribute to this debate by drawing on wittgensteinian philosophy to elucidate hitherto neglected aspects  namely that it is not just social scientists who are in the business of analysing social media  but users themselves  we explore how mainstream social media analytics research  1  overinflates the importance of sociological theories  concepts and methodologies  which do not typically feature in the accounts of social media users    2  downplays the extent to which social media platforms already exhibit order prior to any sociological accounting of them  and   3  thereby produces findings which explain social scientific perspectives rather than the phenomena themselves  we reformulate the ontological and epistemological basis of social media analytics research from a wittgensteinian perspective concerned with what it makes sense to say about social media  as members of society and as researchers studying those members  such a project aims to explore social media users  language as a practice embedded within the context of social life and online communication  this reflects the everyday use of language as an evolving toolkit for undertaking social interaction  pointing towards an alternative conception of social media analytics  
 what you wish for is not what you expect  measuring hope for peace during intractable conflicts protracted intergroup conflicts  like the israeli palestinian conflict  are often referred to as intractable  intractable conflicts are termed as such  partly because group members mired in these disputes believe that the conflict is inherently irreconcilable  to better understand the nature of the perceived irreconcilability of intractable conflicts  jewish israelis  hope for peace was surveyed capturing three interdependent but discrete components of hope  wish for peace  expectations that peace will materialize  and affective hopefulness  to operationafize peace  three definitions of peace  gradually refining from non concrete to concrete  were offered to respondents  n   120   results reveal that expectations for peace among jewish israelis are low but stable across the three definitions of peace while wishes for peace are higher  more dynamic and  for those with right wing political orientation  highly dependent on the definition of peace provided  the more concrete the definition  the less rightists wish for peace  further analysis shows that rightwing leaning respondents exhibit lower wishes for peace  even when the respondent is free to determine what peace might entail  by utilizing novel methods to detect nuances in the dynamics of hope and hopelessness  this study demonstrates that expectation for peace and wishes for peace function in distinct ways during protracted intergroup conflicts  
 what s good for the soil is good for the soul  scientific farming  environmental subjectivities  and the ethics of stewardship in southwestern oklahoma based on 10 months of mixed ethnographic and archival research  this study is concerned with ways in which contemporary agro environmental subjectivities and practices in a southwestern oklahoma farming community are rooted in the massive state level interventions of the new deal era and their successors  we are likewise concerned with how those interventions have become interdigitated with moral discourses and community ethics  as simultaneous expressions of both farmers  identities and the systems of power in which they practice farming  through historic and ethnographic evidence  we demonstrate the ways in which the localization of american agricultural conservation and the attendant  edificatory role of resource bureaucracies have shaped contemporary practices and ideologies of natural resource stewardship among conventional farmers and ranchers  
 what s the matter with civil society  the declining effect of civic involvement on civic identity among czech adolescents this study shows that the beneficial impact of adolescents  involvement in civil society on their civic identity cannot be taken for granted  employing the case of the czech republic  it is shown that this effect has vanished since early postcommunism to the present day  survey data from two different generations of czech middle adolescents were analyzed  the postcommunist generation  collected in 1995  n   1 127  and the current generation  collected in 2010  n   976   while participants  associational involvement and volunteering predicted their stronger civic identity  i e   psychological connection and sense of responsibility to fellow citizens  in 1995  no such effect was observed in 2010  simultaneously  both associational involvement and volunteering were determined by the economic situation of adolescents  family in 2010  but not in 1995  the most likely reason for the vanishing impact of civic involvement is the advancing professionalization of civil society  
 when do companies train unskilled workers  in 2014 only one third of the german   employees participated in company sponsored further training courses  participation rates are particular low among unskilled workers  a qualitative study based on firm level case studies was able to identify a number of favorable institutional influences and mechanisms at the company level  by building on the main findings of this study the current article uses a quantitative research design in order to investigate the role of the institutional characteristics of companies in further training participation  hypotheses are derived from transaction cost theory and the concept of social embeddedness  regression and cluster analysis based on the iab  institute for employment research  establishment survey  2011 wave  show evidence that mechanisms and constellations of institutional embeddedness influence training participation  low skilled workers have a higher likelihood of participating in further training when the company has formalized human resource policies in combination with high employee orientation and the existence of an employee organization  
 when do young adults stop practising a sport  an event history analysis on the impact of four major life events this article investigates the relationship between four major life events and stopping sport participation in young adulthood  we employ a neo weberian theoretical framework related to changes in temporal and social resources to explain how beginning to work  starting to live on one s own  starting to cohabit or getting married  and the birth of one s first child affect the risk to stop practising a sport and to end a sport club membership  we used detailed retrospective life course data from the dutch sportersmonitor 2010 on 3540 individuals to examine the sport careers and major life events of young adults  aged 18 35   our event history analyses indicate that the risk to stop practising a sport increases when young adults begin to work  move out to live on their own  and start cohabiting or get married  the risk of ending a sport club membership rises when young adults start to live on their own and when they cohabit or get married  the birth of the first child increases the risks of both stopping a sport and ending club membership for young women  but not for young men  
 when sects become middle class  impression management among middle class pentecostals in argentina sect to church theory assumes that sects will become more church like as members  socioeconomic status improves  by abandoning tension related characteristics  they decrease the level of tension with their social environment  studying pentecostal middle class congregations in argentina  this article shows that the reduction of tension involves impression management  the studied middle class congregations display middle class features  e g   educational training  and selectively shield tension related practices  e g   glossolalia  from the glances of non pentecostal peers  instead of abandoning tension related practices to reduce tension  middle class congregations strategically adjust their religious practices depending on the extent to which these are accessible for relevant outsiders  switching between sect like and church like styles of religion  
 when technology is more than instrumental  how ethical concerns in eu agriculture co evolve with the development of gm crops being more than mere passive objects used at human will  technologies co determine the values and structures that shape the eu agricultural system  technologies  in use  actively shape human interpretation  human action and co shape our moral standards and routines  it is therefore important to account for the moral significance of agricultural technologies when characterising the structures in place within eu agriculture as well as when trying to understand why a particular agricultural technology is favoured or strongly opposed  from this perspective on technology  an interesting question to pose  is how  within their current use context  genetically modified  gm  crops mediate human interpretation and human practice  this technology is of particular interest  because after more than 30 years  the debate on gm crops is still profound and highly polarised within eu society  yet  too often  this debate is devalued as being irrational or irrelevant  while we show in this article  based on a technological mediation analysis  how ethical concerns about agricultural practices have co evolved with the technological development of gm crops  this qualifies public debate on gm crops in the eu as both legitimate and relevant  as  from this perspective on technology  it can be seen as an important way to both characterise and discuss how eu agriculture is and should be organised  analysing technology in terms of the myriad ways in which it mediates the relationship between humans and their world  further allows us to make some suggestions about how to broaden the ongoing eu discussion beyond the current dichotomous yes no framing  
 when two bodies are  not  a problem  gender and relationship status discrimination in academic hiring junior faculty search committees serve as gatekeepers to the professoriate and play vital roles in shaping the demographic composition of academic departments and disciplines  but how committees select new hires has received minimal scholarly attention  in this article  i highlight one mechanism of gender inequalities in academic hiring  relationship status discrimination  through a qualitative case study of junior faculty search committees at a large r1 university  i show that committees actively considered women s but not men s relationship status when selecting hires  drawing from gendered scripts of career and family that present men s careers as taking precedence over women s  committee members assumed that heterosexual women whose partners held academic or high status jobs were not  movable   and excluded such women from offers when there were viable male or single female alternatives  conversely  committees infrequently discussed male applicants  relationship status and saw all female partners as movable  consequently  i show that the  two body problem  is a gendered phenomenon embedded in cultural stereotypes and organizational practices that can disadvantage women in academic hiring  i conclude by discussing the implications of such relationship status discrimination for sociological research on labor market inequalities and faculty diversity  
 when worlds collide  academic adjustment of somali bantu students with limited formal education in a us elementary school this paper reports on the findings of a two year ethnographic study of newly arrived somali bantu refugee students in a u s  elementary school  k 6  in chicago  these data paint a detailed picture of students  behavioral and academic adjustment to school  and the drivers behind  behavioral incidents   instances when children s behavior presented a problem for school staff  and their academic engagement or disengagement  bantu students required a degree of flexibility and accommodation from their teachers  whose attitudes toward acculturation could generally be characterized as  assimilationist   requiring students to conform to u s  culture and school rules  or  multicultural   respecting and accepting the students expressing their heritage culture at the school   this study illustrates the difficulties faced by refugee students with limited or interrupted formal education  slife  when adjusting to u s  schools  and the pressures placed on teachers and other school staff  strategies used by teachers in working with slife are described  these findings also extend the literature on the academic engagement of immigrants to this group of slife  in this study  slife were disengaged not because of disinterest or resisting adult expectations at school but because they were unfamiliar with the culture of schooling and did not have the academic background necessary to complete school tasks  the study also illustrates the need to provide schools with adequate support to accommodate the needs of slife  
 where are the hooligans  dimensions of football fandom in poland the present paper aims to outline and explain the social world of the most committed football supporters in poland  the analysis proceeds from the assumption that such a community is based on a particular culture established by its own discourses  constituting the habitus of individuals who generate strong social bonds and a normative structure  and is a source of social capital  since this sub culture can be understood as a multidimensional sphere  the article argues that fans can no longer be adequately described in terms of the  hooligan  discourse  although hooligan behaviour has not vanished entirely  it has been pushed out of the stadiums and increasingly functions in a niche outside the immediate context of football  the present article is intended as a contribution to the discussion on european football hooliganism fandom and its transformation  
 where does religion matter most  personal religiosity and the acceptability of wife beating in cross national perspective does religion justify violent acts against wives  or does it reduce approval of this type of intimate partner violence  we examine whether personal religiosity raises or lowers the acceptability of wife beating  in addition  we investigate how the relationship between personal religiosity and attitudes toward wife beating differs depending on the overall normative context of the country where a person lives  using multilevel modeling with data from the fifth wave of the world values survey  2005 2008   we find that greater individual level religiosity reduces the acceptability of wife beating  more importantly  cross level interactions show that these reductions are greatest in countries where there is a general lack of normative restraint as measured by the anomie scale  these observations suggest that religiosity may influence an individual s norms the most in countries where secular controls are absent or weak  
 where have all the leaders gone  evaluating the dynamics of parties  issue attention in coalition governments objective  while selective issue emphasis is a widely recognized strategy of party competition  we have little knowledge about how coalition parties interact with each other when deciding which policy issues to emphasize  therefore we ask  who leads and who follows the issue agenda in coalition governments  methods  we create an issue attention data set using quantitative text analysis from over 40 000 press releases  we use this data set and time series cross section regression analysis to study the dynamics of coalition parties  issue attention  results  we find that junior coalition parties are more responsive to their senior partners than senior partners to their junior partners  hence  while coalition partners generally follow each other  senior partners enjoy a stronger leadership role in the cabinet  conclusion  coalition parties indeed coordinate their issue priorities as they respond to each other s issue agenda  however  due the asymmetric power distribution in coalition cabinets  it is not a negotiation process on equal footing  
 which livestock production claims matter most to consumers  consumers are becoming increasingly interested in how their food is produced  many studies have focused on consumers  preferences and willingness to pay for specific production related claims  labels  on food products  however  few studies have asked consumers to rank the importance of different production claims  in this study  we use a best worst scaling approach to have consumers rank the importance of seven common production claims used on food products  rankings are obtained across four product types  beef  milk  chicken  and eggs  results of the study show that consumers often prefer specific components of more encompassing claims  e g   animals were not treated with growth hormones  no gmos used in production  as opposed to the broader  more encompassing claim itself  such as product is certified organic   the majority of preference shares were captured by the top three claims  though the order of these preferences appears to vary for meat and non meat animals  
 who are your joneses  socio specific income inequality and trust trust is a good approach to explain the functioning of markets  institutions or society as a whole  it is a key element in almost every commercial transaction over time and might be one of the main explanations of economic success and development  trust diminishes the more we perceive others to have economically different living realities  in most of the relevant contributions  scholars have taken a macro perspective on the inequality trust linkage  with an aggregation of both trust and inequality on a country level  however  patterns of within country inequality and possibly influential determinants  such as perception and socioeconomic reference  remained undetected  this paper offers the opportunity to look at the interplay between inequality and trust at a more refined level  a measure of  generalized  trust emerges from ess 5 survey which asks     generally speaking  would you say that most people can be trusted  or that you can t be too careful in dealing with people    with the use of 2009 eu silc data  measurements of income inequality are developed for age specific groups of society in 22 countries  a sizable variation in inequality measures can be noticed  even in low inequality countries  like sweden  income imbalances within certain age groups have the potential to undermine social trust  
 who can deviate from the party line  political ideology moderates evaluation of incongruent policy positions in insula and anterior cingulate cortex political polarization at the elite level is a major concern in many contemporary democracies  which is argued to alienate large swaths of the electorate and prevent meaningful social change from occurring  yet little is known about how individuals respond to political candidates who deviate from the party line and express policy positions incongruent with their party affiliations  this experiment examines the neural underpinnings of such evaluations using functional mri  fmri   during fmri  participants completed an experimental task where they evaluated policy positions attributed to hypothetical political candidates  each block of trials focused on one candidate  democrat or republican   but all participants saw two candidates from each party in a randomized order  on each trial  participants received information about whether the candidate supported or opposed a specific policy issue  these issue positions varied in terms of congruence between issue position and candidate party affiliation  we modeled neural activity as a function of incongruence and whether participants were viewing ingroup or outgroup party candidates  results suggest that neural activity in brain regions previously implicated in both evaluative processing and work on ideological differences  insula and anterior cingulate cortex  differed as a function of the interaction between incongruence  candidate type  ingroup versus outgroup   and political ideology  more liberal participants showed greater activation to incongruent versus congruent trials in insula and acc  primarily when viewing ingroup candidates  implications for the study of democratic representation and linkages between citizens  calls for social change and policy implementation are discussed  
 who gets and who gives employer provided benefits  evidence from matched employer employee data why are some workers employed in some workplaces more likely to acquire valued rewards in the form of employer provided benefits  in this paper  i shed new light on the sources of benefits inequality by developing a structural  rent based theory as a strategy for observing and explaining within and between workplace benefits inequality  i put forward rent extraction by powerful workers as a main causal mechanism that produces within workplace variation  and workplaces  rent sharing  attributable to firms with considerable resources and formalized organizations  as a mechanism that generates between workplace variation  i test this theoretical model and the  linkedness  of the two mechanisms by analyzing israeli matched employer employee register data  i find that workers with greater bargaining power for rent extraction  i e   full time full year  ftfy   service class occupations  are more likely to obtain valued benefits within workplaces  also large scale  large size firms and formalized workplaces  i e   state owned and public organizations and older organizations  are more likely to share their rent by providing valued benefits to all their workers  ftfy workers and service class employees in particular  i conclude that benefits exacerbate the disparities arising from wages except for women  who have higher odds of obtaining valued benefits than comparable men  implicitly  women have an unmeasured preference for benefits  
 who pays for the next wave  the american welfare state and responsibility for flood risk in preparing for and responding to natural hazards and disasters  the welfare state establishes a social contract  distributing responsibilities for what will be collectively managed and what will be individually borne  drawing on archival  interview  and ethnographic data  this article examines the renegotiation of that social contract through the lens of contested efforts to reform the massively indebted us national flood insurance program  nfip  from 2011 to 2014  in the face of a morally charged debate about deservingness and individual choice  congress passed legislation that committed to incorporating need based considerations to the nfip for the first time  the result defined deservingness in terms of ability to pay for risk exposure  qualifying an individualization of responsibility for addressing the problem of flood lossa problem that might instead demand broader risk sharing  particularly as climate change worsens the threat of flooding  
 who sees what as fair  mapping individual differences in valuation of reciprocity  charity  and impartiality when scarce resources are allocated  different criteria may be considered  impersonal allocation  impartiality   the needs of specific individuals  charity   or the relational ties between individuals  reciprocity   in the present research  we investigated how people s perspectives on fairness relate to individual differences in interpersonal orientations  participants evaluated the fairness of allocations based on  a  impartiality   b  charity  and  c  reciprocity  to assess interpersonal orientations  we administered measures of dispositional empathy  i e   empathic concern and perspective taking  and machiavellianism  across two studies  machiavellianism correlated with higher ratings of reciprocity as fair  whereas empathic concern and perspective taking correlated with higher ratings of charity as fair  we discuss these findings in relation to recent neuroscientific research on empathy  fairness  and moral evaluations of resource allocations  
 who should the military recruit  the effects of institutional  occupational  and self enhancement enlistment motives on soldier identification and behavior the u s  military spends millions of dollars and substantial institutional effort to understand enlistment motives and appropriately target incentives  recruiting effort  and marketing to prospective members  similarly  researchers have worked for decades to identify  understand  and conceptualize enlistment motives  much less effort has been made to understand the effect enlistment motives goals have on individuals after they join  this research uses well established enlistment motives goals to identify and understand their effects on soldiers  value to the military in terms of organizational identification and critical discretionary behaviors  using multicohort cross sectional data from future  initial training  and currently serving soldiers  this research finds that intrinsic enlistment motives goals  such as altruistic service and self enhancement  create greater relational and behavioral value than most extrinsic economic enlistment motives goals such as pay  gaining skills for future employment  and educational funding  intrinsic enlistment motives goals have a strong positive effect on perceptions of the organization  social satisfaction  organizational identification  and discretionary pro organizational behaviors  conversely  economic enlistment goals tend to be associated with higher levels of economic satisfaction but decreased organizational identification and pro organizational behavior  importantly  these effects tend to persist among soldiers who have been in the military for years  contrary to the institutional occupational framework  self focused enlistment goals  both intrinsic and extrinsic  can creative substantial value for the military when they are aligned with organizational interests  based on these findings  the practice of using enlistment motives goals to maximizing enlistment without considering their long term impact on relationship quality and behavior appears myopic and may fail to maximize long term value for the military  
 who supports us veterans and who exaggerates their support  support for u s  military personnel appears high  but does it extend to veterans after service ends  this study evaluates public support for social engagement with veterans and spending on recent military veterans  health care and estimates the extent of socially desirable reporting on these forms of support  it uses a list experiment to identify the extent of socially desirable reporting on topics  findings demonstrate that the public offers overwhelming support for spending on veterans  health care and social engagement with the group  but they somewhat overstate this support  support differs by age  race  and political ideology  and social desirability bias varies by race  political ideology  and prior military experience  african americans express the lowest levels of support for returning veterans and the greatest extent of socially desirable reporting on that support  this is despite generally high rates of service and greater labor market returns to that service among this demographic group  
 why america should restore the draft  a response to liebert and golby s  midlife crisis  the all volunteer force at 40  while agreeing with professor liebert and colonel golby that the all volunteer force which in 1973 replaced the selective service system  the draft  enacted by congress at the onset of world war ii has worsened the estrangement of america s military from the larger society and that this estrangement constitutes a hazard to our nation s democracy  colonel hauser disputes their notion that nothing much can be done to remediate that hazard other than encouraging a return to historical traditional nonpartisanship on the part of active and retired military officers  presumably encouraged by civilian political leadership  instead  he suggests  a return to the draft  within a program of national service  would not only ameliorate military societal separation but also provide a multitude of strategic  social  political  and economic benefits to the entire nation  
 why do college graduates behave more healthfully than those who are less educated  college graduates live much healthier lives than those with less education  but research has yet to document with certainty the sources of this disparity  this study examines why u s  young adults who earn college degrees exhibit healthier behaviors than those with less education  i use data from the national longitudinal study of adolescent to adult health  which offers information on education and health behaviors across adolescence and young adulthood  n   14 265   accounting for selection into college  degree attainment substantially reduces the associations between college degree attainment and health behaviors  but college degree attainment demonstrates a strong causal effect on young adult health  financial  occupational  social  cognitive  and psychological resources explain less than half of the association between college degree attainment and health behaviors  the healthier behaviors of college graduates are the result of sorting into educational attainment  embedding of human capital  and mechanisms other than socioeconomic and psychosocial resources

 why have relative rates of class mobility become more equal among women in britain  in a previous paper it has been shown that across three cohorts of men and women born in britain in 1946  1958 and 1970 a gender difference exists in regard to relative rates of class mobility  for men these rates display an essential stability but for women they become more equal  the aim of the present paper is to shed light on the causes of this trendor  that is  of increasing social fluidityamong women  we begin by considering a refined version of the perverse fluidity hypothesis  that is  one that proposes that part time work leads to increasing downward worklife mobility among women that also entails downward intergenerational mobility and thus promotes greater fluidity  we do in fact find that the increase in fluidity is very largely  if not entirely  confined to women who have had at least one period of part time work  however  a more direct test of the hypothesis is not supportive  we are then led to investigate whether it is not that part time working itself is the crucial factor but rather that women who subsequently work part time already differ from those who do not at entry into employment  we find that eventual full  and part timers do not differ in their class origins nor  in any systematic way  in their educational qualifications  but there is a marked and increasing difference in the levels of employment at which they make their labour market entry  eventual part timers are more likely than eventual full timers to enter in working class positions  regardless of their class origins and qualifications  insofar as these women are from more advantaged origins  they would appear not to seek to exploit their advantages to the same extent as do full timers in order to advance their own work careers  and it is  then  in the downward mobility accepted by these womenwho increase in number across the cohortsthat we would locate the main source of the weakening association between class origins and destinations that is revealed among women at large  
 why populism  it is a commonplace to observe that we have been living through an extraordinary pan european and trans atlantic populist moment  but do the heterogeneous phenomena lumped under the rubric  populist  in fact belong together  or is  populism  just a journalistic clich  and political epithet  in the first part of the article  i defend the use of  populism  as an analytic category and the characterization of the last few years as a  populist moment   and i propose an account of populism as a discursive and stylistic repertoire  in the second part  i specify the structural trends and the conjunctural convergence of a series of crises that jointly explain the clustering in space and time that constitutes the populist moment  the question in my title is thus twofold  it is a question about populism as a term or concept and a question about populism as a phenomenon in the world  the article addresses both the conceptual and the explanatory question  limiting the scope of the explanatory argument to the pan european and trans atlantic populist conjuncture of the last few years  
 wicked futures  meaning  matter and the sociology of the future sociologists and futurists have come to see that  fabrications  of the future as entirely open to being remade in the present have become more difficult to sustain in a complex and contingent world  rather  new and more nuanced conceptualizations of the future are required  to contribute to that task  i draw inspiration from rittel and webber s 1973 paper in which they analyze social problems as  wicked problems  to explore how sociologists have found the future to be difficult and tricky  both conceptually and empirically and have sought to overcome those difficulties through various analytical strategies  i discuss the onto epistemological status of the future in sociology  tracing major shifts in theorizing of the future and suggest that what makes the future so wicked   so difficult and pernicious   is that it is an  entanglement of matter and meaning   in doing so  i draw on insights from sts  science and technology studies  and other fields of inquiry to propose a new conceptual language in which to do the sociology of the future  
 wider community segregation and the effect of neighbourhood ethnic diversity on social capital  an investigation into intra neighbourhood trust in great britain and london extensive research has demonstrated that neighbourhood ethnic diversity is negatively associated with intra neighbourhood social capital  this study explores the role of segregation and integration in this relationship  to do so it applies three level hierarchical linear models to two sets of data from across great britain and within london  and examines how segregation across the wider community in which a neighbourhood is nested impacts trust amongst neighbours  this study replicates the increasingly ubiquitous finding that neighbourhood diversity is negatively associated with neighbour trust  however  we demonstrate that this relationship is highly dependent on the level of segregation across the wider community in which a neighbourhood is nested  increasing neighbourhood diversity only negatively impacts neighbour trust when nested in more segregated wider communities  individuals living in diverse neighbourhoods nested within integrated wider communities experience no trust penalty  these findings show that segregation plays a critical role in the neighbourhood diversity trust relationship  and that its absence from the literature biases our understanding of how ethnic diversity affects social cohesion  
 willful versus woeful underemployment  perceived volition and social class background among overqualified college graduates this article challenges a key assumption of underemployment scholarship  that the modal underemployed worker is involuntarily underemployed  drawing from in depth interviews  the author analyzes one particular type of underemployment  overqualification among college graduates  findings demonstrate  a  that workers differ markedly in their perceptions of overqualification   b  that these perceptions create distinct overqualification experiences  and  c  that these experiences vary by social class background  while some respondents report being overqualified at no choice of their own and are struggling to find better work  many others narrate their overqualification experience as voluntary  among these graduates  who are likely to come from middle class backgrounds  some understand overqualification as a temporary period of exploration  others think of it as potentially permanent and see themselves as opting out of the typical postcollege career path  importantly  typical factors that have been analyzed as consequences of overqualification  job dissatisfaction and distress  covary with perceptions  such that the most negative outcomes tend to be among the disproportionately working class graduates who view themselves as involuntarily underemployed  
 with an open mind  openness to experience moderates the effect of interethnic encounters on support for immigration this article examines whether the effect of interethnic encounters on natives  attitudes towards immigration varies with the big five personality trait openness to experience  we hypothesize that individuals who score high on openness  and who therefore are more appreciative of and responsive to new experiences  react more positively less negatively to interethnic encounters  we test this conjecture on two surveys collected in denmark and canada  in line with our expectations  the analyses suggest that openness positively moderates the effect of interethnic encounters on immigration attitudes  compared to those with lower levels of openness  more open individuals express more pro immigration attitudes when experiencing both personal interethnic contact and self reported exposure to ethnic diversity in the neighbourhood  
 wither the nation state  a comparative analysis of nationalism in textbooks what happens to the historic nationalizing purpose of schooling in an era of pervasive globalization  we address this question by examining patterns and predictors of nationalist emphases in 576 secondary school social science textbooks from 78 countries published between 1955 and 2011  our descriptive and multilevel analyses show that nationalist narratives in textbooks persist into the recent globalization era and on average are not diminished in countries that are more economically  politically  or socially globalized  however  countries that occupy a dominant position in world society either through western cultural status or deeper embeddedness in international non governmental organizations  ingos  tend to display lower levels of nationalism in their textbooks  our examination contributes to the sociology of education by highlighting that the relationship between the global and the national is not a zero sum game  even in our globalized world  nationalist educational narratives are alive and well  we further contribute to the world society perspective by highlighting a tension between recent world cultural shifts toward individual rights and cosmopolitanism and the continued centrality of the nation state model in world society  our results suggest that attenuation of nationalist celebrations in schooling may be easiest for globally dominant countries whose legitimacy as nation states is not in question  
 women at university top management levels  new legal context and equity plans this research aims to identify the main barriers that make the access of women to top management levels in universities difficult  these barriers promote the generally known and assumed reality of gender inequality in these governing bodies  a scientific method  concept mapping trochim  1989  has been used to this aim  this methodology  whose use is new in this field of research  has allowed us to identify both the causes and possible solutions  results highlight the need to undertake strategic lines in policies of equality  focusing on eliminating certain weaknesses and threats detected  in order to achieve effective gender equality  these results  in turn  can also be considered as a starting point in the design of real and effective equality governmental university gender policies in many countries  
 women behaving badly  negative posts on facebook memorial pages this study explores negative posts in facebook pages dedicated to dead subjects  as with places for mourning in offline environments  memorial pages in facebook appear to exude a sacred character as objects to both celebrate the life of the deceased and grieve their departure with others  through a two step content analysis of an initial sample of 600 pages containing the r i p   acronym in their title  we found  however  a number of posts violating conventional expectations of respect for these mourning spaces  negative posts in memorial pages take the form of flames  i e   insults directed at the subject of the page  its administrator  or other visitors   venting  e g   violent language against the victimizers of the subject of a memorial page   or spam   i e   advertisement and content not related to the subject and purpose of the page   moreover  while results show that most memorial pages in facebook are created and maintained by women  even thought the subject in the majority of those pages are young males who died an untimely death   they also reveal that women post the majority of negative posts in those pages as well  in other words  whereas women seem to perpetuate traditional offline roles in connection to mourning and grieving rituals  in the online world  they are also the first ones challenging the socially sanctioned sacral attributes of those practices in social networking sites  
 women s access to property  a comparative study on islamic and kemalist women in turkey this article uses a comparative approach to discuss women s access to property using evidence collected from field research conducted on two distinct communities of istanbul  one secular and one islamic  the two groups of women possess distinctly different views of the world and how it is organized  this is particularly the case concerning gender where secular women put forth a view rooted in the sameness of the genders where the islamic women were clear in their commitment to the idea of difference  these attitudes toward the equality and difference of the genders structures the relations of these women to property and the process of inheritance  
 women s changing responsibilities and pleasures as consumers  an analysis of alcohol related advertisements in finnish  italian  and swedish women s magazines from the 1960s to the 2000s since the 1960s  feminist movements have emphasized that men and women should be seen as equal in their roles as parents  breadwinners  and citizens  this conception is not confirmed by the images produced in advertising  this article presents an analysis of alcohol related advertisements published in finnish  italian  and swedish women s magazines from the 1960s to the 2000s  the advertisements are approached as performative texts in which gender is made visible here and now by placing women in particular consumer positions relative to private or public spheres and by associating specific kinds of gender expectations and norms that reflect women s shifting responsibilities and pleasures  the article asks what kind of drinking related identities have been portrayed as desirable in women s magazine advertisements over the past few decades and how they have changed as we move closer to the present day  the analysis reveals both continuity and variability in alcohol related consumer identities in advertisements in finnish  italian  and swedish women s magazines  it shows that as finland  italy  and sweden have developed from modern societies to late modern societies  women s responsibilities and pleasures have expanded from the traditional domain of the private sphere into multiple new areas  the expansion of women s identities has occurred differently in each geographical area  this does not  however  mean that the traditional gender norms have disintegrated and been replaced by equal gender norms  rather  it seems that traditional gender norms continue to be reproduced with varying nuances in alcohol related advertising  
 women s employment trajectories during early adulthood in urban china  a cohort comparison this study uses retrospective work history data from cgss 2008 and employs group based trajectory analysis to model the diverse employment trajectories of cohorts of urban chinese women  born in the 1940s 1970s  during young adulthood  age 20 35   we identify ideal types of urban women s employment trajectories and explore traits associated with each group type  in particular  we examine whether and how the timing of marriage and fertility as well as socioeconomic background help to distinguish patterns of women s labor force attachment in young adulthood  we also examine how these patterns change across cohorts given china s rapid social transformations in the past few decades  we find that delaying family formation is generally associated with more consistent work attachment  but this relationship is also largely associated with one s socioeconomic background  our results reveal significant cohort variations in the shape of women s employment trajectories and we discuss how institutional and cultural contexts of different historical periods could have shaped family formation and employment processes differently  our findings highlight the heterogeneity of urban women s work and family formation patterns in the context of rising gender inequalities and rapid socioeconomic transformation over time   c  2017 elsevier inc  all rights reserved  
 women  weight  poverty and menopause  understanding health practices in a context of chronic disease prevention socioeconomic inequalities in health persist despite major investments in illness prevention campaigns and universal healthcare systems  in this context  the increased risks of chronic diseases of specific sub groups of vulnerable populations should be further investigated  the objective of this qualitative study is to examine the interaction between socioeconomic status  ses  and body weight in order to understand underprivileged women s increased vulnerability to chronic diseases after menopause  by drawing specifically on pierre bourdieu s sociocultural theory of practice  20 semi structured interviews were conducted from may to december of 2013 to investigate the health practices of clinically overweight  postmenopausal women living an underprivileged life in canada  findings emphasise that poor life conditions undermine personal investment in preventive health and weight loss  showing the importance for policy makers to bring stronger consideration on upstream determinants of health  
 words don t come easy  al jazeera s migrant refugee distinction and the european culture of  mis trust al jazeera s august 2015 editorial decision to substitute refugee  for economic migrant  in its coverage of the mediterranean migration crisis  provides an opportunity to re frame the relationship between the politics of race  immigration and media representations of refugees  situating the broadcaster s publicly announced rationale for the decision within a critique of the migrant refugee dichotomy enforced by european public policy  this article  first  demonstrates that the policy couplet mobilizes oppositional yet interdependent identities  the discursive distancing of migrant  from refugee  in news content does not dislodge their mutually reinforcing power to define the parameters of inclusion   second  the article examines how the policy onus placed on refugees to justify their claim as victims  reproduces racialized codes of belonging that perpetuate the denial of autonomy  persons seeking refuge in europe must sustain an identity of non threatening victim  if they are to gain recognition in a securitized culture of  mis trust  al jazeera s intervention strengthens the media representation of refugees as human beings without choice  yet  the broadcaster s decision to give voice  by challenging racism  does not break the european political consensus on immigration and asylum that positions non western  peoples as victim pariah  to be saved  and suspected   the media policy migration nexus ensures that refugee exclusion is always possible  
 work family balance and marital satisfaction  the mediating effects of mental and physical health applying the stress divorce model to explain the impact of spillover stress  this study analyzes 1 961 married participants in the national study of the changing workforce  specifically  it tests the individual and combined effects of work to family conflict  family to work conflict  work to family enrichment  and family to work enrichment on marital satisfaction  additionally  this study tests whether these effects are mediated by mental and physical health  the results suggest that mental health and physical health both fully mediate the effect of work to family conflict  while mental health and physical health both partially mediate the effect of work to family enrichment on marital satisfaction  on the other hand  neither of the health measures mediates the effects of family to work conflict and family to work enrichment on marital satisfaction  these results suggest the importance of examining both the positive and the negative aspects of work family balance in understanding marital satisfaction and highlight the mediating effects of mental and physical health in shaping how work family balance affects marital satisfaction  
 work related travel over the life course and its link to fertility  a comparison between four european countries in contemporary societies  travelling intensively to and for work has become an important part in many people s lives  a life course approach suggests that spatial mobility may  however  conflict with other life domains such as fertility  especially for women  using longitudinal survey data from france  germany  spain  and switzerland  our study provides novel evidence that the interdependence of fertility and work related spatial mobility behaviours is largely shaped by national contexts  based on innovative techniques of sequence analysis  our results indicate that long term experiences of daily and weekly long distance commuting and overnight work travel are associated with lower fertility mainly among women in germany and switzerland  in france and spain  the association is weaker or absent  interestingly  male overnight travellers in germany and switzerland show similar tendencies  these men have a comparatively lower fertility than other men  although the cross national differences are less pronounced than among women  our study discusses the role of national family policies  social norms  and labour market structures in facilitating or hindering the reconciliation between fertility and work related spatial mobility  
 working against many grains  rethinking difference  emancipation and agency in the counter discourse of an ethnic minority women s organisation in belgium in this article  we aim to contribute to feminist academic debates about multiculturalism and secularism religion by drawing upon an analysis of an ethnic minority women s organisation in belgium that has been active since 1999  ella  the analysis focuses upon the way in which ella constructs notions of empowerment and emancipation by discussing structural inequalities  cultural ethnic values and religious authority and identity  first  we look at how ella formulates its ideas about the emancipation trajectories of minoritised women and the potential role of religious belonging  second  we look at ella s discussion of religious interpretation and gender sexual diversity  here  we explore assumptions about the relationship between religious authority and minoritised women s and lgbtqs  desires and pursuit for knowledge  we conclude by considering ella as an affirmative critical actor of multiculturalism  and an implicit agent of religious reform  
 working algorithms  software automation and the future of work while some argue that the rise of software automation threatens workers with obsolescence  others assert that new complementarities between humans and software systems are likely to emerge  this study draws on 19 months of participant observation research at a software firm to investigate how relations between workers and technology evolved over three phases of the company s development  the author finds two forms of human software complementarity  computational labor that supports or stands in for software algorithms and emotional labor aimed at helping users adapt to software systems  instead of perfecting software algorithms that would progressively push people out of the production process  managers continually reconfigured assemblages of software and human helpers  developing new forms of organization with a dynamic relation to technology  the findings suggest how the dynamism of the organizations in which software algorithms are produced and implemented will contribute to labor s enduring relevance in the digital age  
 written and oral in islamic law  documentary evidence and non muslims in moroccan shari a courts this article begins from the premise that the margins can shine light on the center  and uses the experience of jews  thought of as marginal in the islamic world  in moroccan courts  similarly thought of as marginal in islamic history  to tell a new story about orality and writing in islamic law  using archival evidence from nineteenth century morocco  i argue that  contrary to the prevailing historiography  written evidence was central to procedure in moroccan sharia courts  records of nineteenth century lawsuits between jews and muslims show that not only were notarized documents regularly submitted in court  but they could outweigh oral testimony  traditionally thought of as the gold standard of evidence in islam  the evidentiary practices of moroccan sharia courts are supported by the jurisprudential literature of the mlik school of sunni islam  the only one prevalent in morocco  these findings have particular relevance for the experience of non muslims in islamic legal institutions  scholars have generally assumed that jews and christians faced serious restrictions in their ability to present evidence in sharia courts  since they could not testify orally against muslims  however  in morocco jews had equal access to notarized documents  and thus stood on a playing field that  theoretically at least  was level with their muslim neighbors  more broadly  i explore ways in which old assumptions about the relationship of the written to the oral continue to pervade our understanding of islamic law  and call for an approach that breaks down the dichotomy between writing and orality  
 young people s perspectives in developing a survey item on factors that influence body image body image concerns are prevalent among adolescents  however  a single item assessing what influences their body image does not exist  thus  the aim of this study was to develop a survey item on the factors influencing adolescent body image for inclusion in a nationally representative health behaviour survey  this article describes the methodology used to develop a survey item and the results obtained through its inclusion in the survey  the research design included a literature review  consultation work with young people and data analyses of the new survey item included in the survey  results from the current study revealed that a variety of factors influence adolescent body image  some of which have been overlooked in the traditional body image literature to date  this study demonstrates consultation with young people can contribute to the development of quantitative measures  
 youth adult partnership and youth civic development  cross national analyses for scholars and field professionals across the world  community based youth organizations are engaging youth as partners with adults to promote youth civic development  a sample of 528 youth from the united states  portugal  and malaysia were surveyed to explore associations between youth adult partnership  youth voice in decision making  supportive adult relationships  and two key aspects of civic development  youth empowerment  community connections   multi level modeling  regression  and profile analysis were used to compare patterns of association across the three national samples  results indicate that youth are most likely to achieve positive outcomes when they experience the freedom to make decisions  while experiencing trust and power sharing from adults  the results were consistent across the three national samples  suggesting that the influence of partnership may transcend cultures and contexts  future scholarship should aim to support field professionals in building organizational structures and opportunities that encourage shared dialogue  program planning  and purposeful action among youth and adults  
 zygmunt bauman s moral saint  reclaiming self in the sociology of morality zygmunt bauman s sociology of morality signals an important new direction from the orthodoxy of emile durkheim s society  realised ethics  the first part of this paper defends bauman s postmodern position as valuable in theorising the moral present  offering a sociological conception of the sources  strategies and experience of contemporary morality  the paper then shifts to a critique of bauman s social theory of being for the other   arguing that it misses the particular and embodied aspects of moral sociality and effaces the self in endless responsibility to the other  it is suggested that a sociology of morality is needed which goes beyond bauman s moral saint and provides conceptual space to theorise the self and cultures of authenticity and self fulfilment
