 outta my way  individual and environmental correlates of interactions between pedestrians and vehicles during street crossings because pedestrian crash rates remain lower than other collision types  surrogate measures such as traffic interactions are now used in road safety research to complement crash history  using naturalistic data collection  we sought to assess 1  the likelihood of occurrence of interactions between pedestrians and vehicles based on individual and crossing characteristics  and 2  differences in interaction characteristics between children  adult and senior pedestrians  observations of pedestrian crossing behaviours  n   4687  were recorded at 278 crossings  for  recorded interactions  n   843   information was collected to characterize the behaviours of involved parties  a mixed effect logit regression  model was performed to assess the factors associated with interactions  cm square tests evaluated differences between age groups and characteristics of observed interactions  older adults were those more likely to be involved in an interaction event  bicycle paths  different crossing surface material and one way streets were significantly associated with fewer interactions with vehicles  while parked vehicles nearby and crossings on arterial roads were significantly associated with more interactions  children and the elderly  80 years of age or more  did have distinct patterns of interaction  with more careful drivers cyclists behaviours being observed towards children and lesser regulation compliance towards the elderly  given the growing emphasis and adoption of active transportation in many cities  the number of interactions between pedestrians and vehicles during street crossings is likely to increase  educating drivers and pedestrians to respect each other s space requires an understanding of where  between whom  and under what circumstances interactions occur  such an approach can also help identify which engineering and enforcement programs are needed to ensure safe pedestrian crossings since interactions can be  good markers of uncomfortable crossing situations that may deter walking and lead to more collisions  
 waiting on the train  the anticipatory  causal  effects of crossrail in ealing this paper estimates the willingness to pay for anticipated journey time savings introduced by the crossrail intervention in the london borough of ealing  given crossrail remains under construction  we estimate how the anticipated benefit of crossrail s announcement enters the house price determination process  anticipated journey time savings should enter the home buyer s pricing equation because these benefits are speculatively internalised even before the service becomes operational  using a experimental method that accounts for the possibility of a spatial autoregressive process in housing values  we test the hypotheses that the announcement of a new commuter rail service generated a location premium  and that house price appreciation reflected proximity to crossrail terminals  our evidence suggests home buyers significantly valued proximity to planned crossrail terminals following the post announcement period  
 a bayesian approach to system safety assessment and compliance assessment for unmanned aircraft systems this paper presents a new approach to showing compliance to system safety requirements for aviation systems  the aim is to improve the objectivity  transparency  and rationality of compliance findings in those cases where there is uncertainty in the assessments of the system  a bayesian approach is adopted that facilitates a more comprehensive treatment of the uncertainties inherent to all system safety assessments  the assessment and compliance framework is reformulated as a problem of decision making under uncertainty  and a normative decision approach is used to illustrate the approach  a case study system safety assessment of a civil unmanned aircraft system is used to exemplify the proposed approach  the proposed approach could be readily applied to any regulatory compliance process and would represent a significant change to  and advancement over  current aviation safety regulatory practice  this paper is the first to describe the application of bayesian techniques to the field of aviation system safety analysis  the adoption of the proposed compliance approach would bring aviation system safety practitioners in line with more contemporary  and well established  approaches adopted in the nuclear power and space launch industries   c  2017 elsevier ltd  all rights reserved  
 a bayesian network model for contextual versus non contextual driving behavior assessment driving behavior is generally considered to be one of the most important factors in crash occurrence  this paper aims to evaluate the benefits of utilizing context relevant information in the driving behavior assessment process  i e  contextual driving behavior assessment approach   we use a bayesian network  bn  model that investigates the relationships between gps driving observations  individual driving behavior  individual driving risks  and individual crash frequency  in contrast to prior studies without context information  i e  non contextual approach   the data used in the bn approach is a combination of contextual features in the surrounding environment that may contribute to crash risk  such as road conditions surrounding the vehicle of interest and dynamic traffic flow information  as well as the non contextual data such as instantaneous driving speed and the acceleration deceleration of a vehicle  an information aggregation mechanism is developed to aggregates massive amounts of vehicle gps data points  kinematic events and context information into drivel level data  with the proposed model  driving behavior risks for drivers is assessed and the relationship between contextual driving behavior and crash occurrence is established  the analysis results in the case study section show that the contextual model has significantly better performance than the non contextual model  and that drivers who drive at a speed faster than others or much slower than the speed limit at the ramp  and with more rapid acceleration or deceleration on freeways are more likely to be involved in crash events  in addition  younger drivers  and female drivers with higher vmt are found to have higher crash risk   c  2017 elsevier ltd  all rights reserved  
 a behavioral choice model of the use of car sharing and ride sourcing services there are a number of disruptive mobility services that are increasingly finding their way into the marketplace  two key examples of such services are car sharing services and ride sourcing services  in an effort to better understand the influence of various exogenous socio economic and demographic variables on the frequency of use of ride sourcing and car sharing services  this paper presents a bivariate ordered probit model estimated on a survey data set derived from the 2014 2015 puget sound regional travel study  model estimation results show that users of these services tend to be young  well educated  higher income  working individuals residing in higher density areas  there are significant interaction effects reflecting the influence of children and the built environment on disruptive mobility service usage  the model developed in this paper provides key insights into factors affecting market penetration of these services  and can be integrated in larger travel forecasting model systems to better predict the adoption and use of mobility on demand services

 a branch and price algorithm for railway rolling stock rescheduling how to best reschedule their fleet of rolling stock units during a disruption is an optimization problem regularly faced by railway operators  despite the problem s high complexity  it is still usually solved manually  in this paper we propose a path based mathematical formulation and solve it using a branch and price algorithm  we demonstrate that  unlike flow based approaches  our formulation is more easily extended to handle certain families of constraints  such as train unit maintenance restrictions  the proposed algorithm is benchmarked on several real life instances provided by the suburban railway operator in copenhagen  dsb s tog  when used in combination with a lower bound method taken from the literature we show that near optimal solutions to this rescheduling problem can be found within a few seconds  furthermore  we show that the proposed methodology can be used  with minor modification  on a tactical planning level  where it produces near optimal rolling stock schedules in minutes of cpu time   c  2017 elsevier ltd  all rights reserved  
 a branch and price algorithm for the vehicle routing problem with roaming delivery locations we study the vehicle routing problem with roaming delivery locations in which the goal is to find a least cost set of delivery routes for a fleet of capacitated vehicles and in which a customer order has to be delivered to the trunk of the customer s car during the time that the car is parked at one of the locations in the  known  customer s travel itinerary  we formulate the problem as a set covering problem and develop a branch and price algorithm for its solution  the algorithm can also be used for solving a more general variant in which a hybrid delivery strategy is considered that allows a delivery to either a customer s home or to the trunk of the customer s car  we evaluate the effectiveness of the many algorithmic features incorporated in the algorithm in an extensive computational study and analyze the benefits of these innovative delivery strategies  the computational results show that employing the hybrid delivery strategy results in average cost savings of nearly 20  for the instances in our test set   c  2017 elsevier ltd  all rights reserved  
 a case study exploring firefighters  and municipal officials  preparedness for electrical vehicles purpose this study presents a social perspective on new vehicle technology  it explores the self reported preparedness of the fire departments  i e   rescue services  in sweden s three largest cities regarding rescue operations involving electrical vehicles  evs   methods in this multi method study  in depth interviews were performed with emergency service officers and municipal officers in each city  results the results indicate that firefighters have little experience of accidents with evs and they are learning reactively  the risks were not clearly identified  more knowledge is needed of identifying and disconnecting electricity in evs  a more efficient way to find information about new vehicles is vital concerning the safety aspect in rescue operations  the level of knowledge about new vehicle technology varied between departments  for the municipal officers  environmental aspects are of most interest  whereas safety and rescue operations involving evs are rarely addressed  the responsibility for disseminating information about the safe handling of evs was unclear  conclusion the fire departments need more resources for education and training to keep up with technical developments and to be proactive  another desired development is a solution for easy access to vehicle information  since the environmental issues are setting the agenda  not the safety issues  lesser environment risks could become greater safety risks  we stress the need for various occupational decision making at all levels of society to cooperate in order to take responsibility for the safe introduction for new more environmentally friendly transport vehicle technique and disseminating safety information in a collected and systematic way  
 a case study  the impact of low cost carriers on inbound tourism of saudi arabia this study investigates the impact of low cost carriers  lccs  on saudi arabia s tourism demand  it also provides an understanding of the relationship between air transport development and tourism development in the gulf region  the box jenkins sarima x models were employed to model and forecast international tourist arrivals to saudi arabia  using monthly international tourist arrivals to saudi arabia from july 2010 to december 2015  the forecasting models were significantly accurate  with lower values of mape  map  and rmse  the findings suggest that an increase in airline capacity  religious travel  and airline competition are associated with the increasing international tourist arrivals to saudi arabia  this also indicates that there is a positive relationship between air transport development and tourism development  further aviation liberalisation in the gulf region is discussed to give opportunities for the region s lccs to increase their share of the increasing air travel demand  thereby enhancing tourism development   c  2017 elsevier ltd  all rights reserved

 a comparative injury severity analysis of motorcycle at fault crashes on rural and urban roadways in alabama the research described in this paper explored the factors contributing to the injury severity resulting from the motorcycle at fault accidents in rural and urban areas in alabama  given the occurrence of a motorcycle at fault crash  random parameter logit models of injury severity  with possible outcomes of fatal  major  minor  and possible or no injury  were estimated  the estimated models identified a variety of statistically significant factors influencing the injury severities resulting from motorcycle at fault crashes  according to these models  some variables were found to be significant only in one model  rural or urban  but not in the other one  for example  variables such as clear weather  young motorcyclists  and roadway without light were found significant only in the rural model  on the other hand  variables such as older female motorcyclists  horizontal curve and at intersection were found significant only in the urban model  in addition  some variables  such as  motorcyclists under influence of alcohol  non usage of helmet  high speed roadways  etc   were found significant in both models  also  estimation findings showed that two parameters  clear weather and roadway without light  in the rural model and one parameter  on weekend  in the urban model could be modeled as random parameters indicating their varying influences on the injury severity due to unobserved effects  based on the results obtained  this paper discusses the effects of different variables on injury severities resulting from rural and urban motorcycle at fault crashes and their possible explanations  
 a comparison of car driving  public transport and cycling experiences in three european cities private car use in large cities causes congestion and pollution  and should be reduced  previous research has shown that private cars are preferred over public transport  but it is not known whether that preference holds in large cities that attenuate the usual benefits of car travel  the small body of research comparing cycling with car driving has found a preference for cycling  but it is not clear what that preference is based on  nor its generalizability  particularly beyond those who already cycle frequently  the current study  which was undertaken as part of the eu funded project  superhub  sustainable and persuasive human users mobility in future cities   compares liking and experiences of car driving  public transport and cycling in three european cities  barcelona  helsinki and milan  cycling was liked significantly more than car driving and public transport  and was rated significantly more positively than or equivalent to cars on many attributes  including flexibility and reliability  indicating an important role for cycling in the reduction of urban car use  public transport was rated significantly less positively than car driving for some attributes  e g  flexibility  reliability  but more positively for others  e g  value for money  safety   demonstrating that in large cities  the usual advantages of car driving over public transport are considerably attenuated  almost all these findings were replicated across all three cities  suggesting that they can be generalised  most city dwellers already use more than one mode regularly  which may support mode change campaigns  in particular  a substantial proportion of car driver commuters already enjoyed cycling on a regular basis  suggesting the potential for mode switching  via multimodality to overcome the obstacle of journey distance   c  2017 elsevier ltd  all rights reserved  
 a comparison of different container sorting systems in modern rail rail transshipment yards rail rail transshipment yards act as central hub nodes within a railway network and enable a rapid consolidation of containers between different freight trains  to avoid an excessive movement of gantry cranes when transferring a container from one train to another  modem yards apply sorting systems where shuttle cars move containers horizontally along the spread of the yard  this paper compares four elementary sorting systems  specifically  we compare rubber tired and rail mounted shuttles and differentiate whether a pure shuttle system or a lift   shuttle system is applied  in pure shuttle systems  a shuttle receives a container from a crane and transports it towards the destination crane  where it serves as a storage device until being unloaded  a lift   shuttle system applies shuttles with an integrated lifting platform  so that they are able to autonomously store and receive containers from a separate storage rack both alternatives exist in rubber tired and rail mounted versions  as the shuttles are the main driver of the investment costs  we compare the required fleet size for timely supplying given gantry crane schedules within all four systems  for this purpose  we derive suited scheduling procedures  this way  decision support for yard managers having to identify a suited sorting system and to layout a new terminal is provided   c  2017 elsevier ltd  all rights reserved

 a comparison of road and footpath based walkability indices and their associations with active travel background  many studies have used the concept of  walkability  to assess how conducive a neighbourhood is to physical activity  especially active travel  studies in the united states and australia have traditionally used a road based network system of intersection density to derive a walkability index  however  other studies suggest that analyses based on footpath networks may provide a more robust basis for assessing the walkability of built environments in the european context as they better capture alternative opportunities for physical activity such as parks and greenways  to date  no studies have examined whether a road  or footpath based network is more closely related to actual physical activity behaviour  therefore  the aims of this paper were to examine associations between active travel and walkability indices based on both road  and footpath based intersection density and to establish which measure provided the best fit to the data  methods  cross sectional survey and geographical information system  gis  data were collected from february 2010 january 2011  a series of crude and fully adjusted zero inflated negative binomial regression analyses examined associations between road  and footpath based walk ability and the average minutes per week of active travel  results  model fit indices suggested that the models using road based walkability provided a marginally better fit  however  regression results indicated similar findings with respect to the effect of road  and footpath based walkability on active travel  conclusion  results suggest that footpath based indices of walkability are comparable to road based indices in their associations with active travel and are an alternative model  particularly for assessing environmental change in non road based built environment interventions  
 a complex network perspective for characterizing urban travel demand patterns  graph theoretical analysis of large scale origin destination demand networks urban travel demand  consisting of thousands or millions of origin destination trips  can be viewed as a large scale weighted directed graph  the paper applies a complex network motivated approach to understand and characterize urban travel demand patterns through analysis of statistical properties of origin destination demand networks  we compare selected network characteristics of travel demand patterns in two cities  presenting a comparative network theoretic analysis of chicago and melbourne  the proposed approach develops an interdisciplinary and quantitative framework to understand mobility characteristics in urban areas  the paper explores statistical properties of the complex weighted network of urban trips of the selected cities  we show that travel demand networks exhibit similar properties despite their differences in topography and urban structure  results provide a quantitative characterization of the network structure of origin destination demand in cities  suggesting that the underlying dynamical processes in travel demand networks are similar and evolved by the distribution of activities and interaction between places in cities  
 a copula based approach for estimating the travel time reliability of urban arterial estimating the travel time reliability  tfr  of urban arterial is critical for real time and reliable route guidance and provides theoretical bases and technical support for sophisticated traffic management and control  the state of art procedures for arterial tfr estimation usually assume that path travel time follows a certain distribution  with less consideration about segment correlations  however  the conventional approach is usually unrealistic because an important feature of urban arterial is the dependent structure of travel times on continuous segments  in this study  a copula based approach that incorporates the stochastic characteristics of segments travel time is proposed to model arterial travel time distribution  ttd   which serves as a basis for tfr quantification  first  segments correlation is empirically analyzed and different types of copula models are examined  then  fitting marginal distributions for segment ttd is conducted by parametric and non parametric regression analysis  respectively  based on the estimated parameters of the models  the best fitting copula is determined in terms of the goodness of fit tests  last  the model is examined at two study sites with avi data and ngsim trajectory data  respectively  the results of path ttd estimation demonstrate the advantage of the proposed copula based approach  compared with the convolution model without capturing segments correlation and the empirical distribution fitting methods  furthermore  when considering the segments correlation effect  it was found that the estimated path tfr is more accurate than that by the convolution model   c  2017 elsevier ltd  all rights reserved

 a credit based congestion management scheme in general two mode networks with multiclass users this paper examines the design of the credit based congestion management schemes that achieve pareto improving outcome in general two mode networks  it is assumed that transit is a slower but cheaper alternative to driving alone  the distributional welfare effects of congestion pricing on users with the different value of time  vot  in liu and nie  trans res board 2283 34 43  2012  are used in developing pareto improving credit schemes  we show that  similar to the single mode model  the sufficient and necessary condition for the existence of a discriminatory pareto improving credit scheme is the reduction in the total system cost  a sufficient condition for the existence of an anonymous pareto improving credit scheme is also derived  a cross od subsidization scheme is proposed when the sufficient condition is not satisfied for each origin destination  o d  pair  numerical experiments on the expanded sioux falls networks with a log normal vot distribution demonstrate that the proposed pareto improving scheme can generate positive net revenue in the presence of good transit coverage  
 a critical evaluation of the next generation simulation  ngsim  vehicle trajectory dataset a clear understanding of car following behavior and microscopic relationships is critical for advancing traffic flow theory  without empirical microscopic data  plausible but incorrect hypotheses perpetuate in the vacuum  the next generation simulation  ngsim  project was undertaken to collect such data and the ngsim data set has become the de facto standard  underlying the vast majority of empirically based advances of the past decade  but there has been a growing minority of researchers who have found unrealistic relationships in the ngsim data  to date  the critical findings have almost exclusively come from the existing ngsim database itself  unfortunately  as this paper shows  the ngsim errors are beyond anything that could be corrected strictly through cleaning or interpolation of the reported ngsim data  this paper takes the deepest evaluation yet of the ngsim data  this research manually re extracts the vehicle trajectories from a portion of the original ngsim video to explicitly quantify ngsim errors  e g   piecewise constant speeds punctuated by brief periods of large acceleration exhibited by the ngsim data were not evident in the newly extracted trajectories  this point is particularly troublesome for applications that rely on acceleration  e g   most car following models  the magnitude of errors exhibit a dependency on speed  location and vehicle length  examples are shown where a real vehicle stopped but the ngsim trajectory does not and then overruns the location of the real leader  needless to say  the re extracted trajectories showed much cleaner speed spacing relationships than the corresponding raw ngsim trajectories  finally  this work tracked the original ngsim vehicles seen in one camera and added another 236 vehicles  11   visible before after the period of ngsim tracking  as of publication  the manually re extracted data from this paper will be released to the research community   c  2017 elsevier ltd  all rights reserved  
 a cross sectional survey of attitudes  behaviours  barriers and motivators to cycling in university students high rates of active travel are essential aspects of healthy communities  increasing cycling participation has the potential to address a range of long term health and societal issues  and positively contribute to the health and sustainability agenda  universities have been proposed as appropriate settings for a healthy place approach however  there is a paucity of evidence on student cycling  therefore the aim of this paper is to explore the motivators and barriers to cycling amongst university students  an online cross sectional survey of young adults  18 25 years  studying at an urban united kingdom university was undertaken  using convenience sampling participants were surveyed on levels of cycling  e g  daily  weekly  alongside perceptions  barriers and motivators to cycling activity  194 responses were received of which 55  were male  54  owned a bicycle and 14  were regular cyclists  cycling motivators were enjoyment and improving fitness  especially amongst regular cyclists  however  weather and safety concerns were the main barriers  the majority  85   felt more should be done to encourage cycling  with 70  stating cycling was easier  elsewhere   respondents felt cycling had an important environmental element  67    although less than 8  cited congestion and pollution reduction as a reason for cycling and 64  believed there were more barriers to cycling than driving  this study suggests that levels of cycling within a university setting may be higher than the general population and the appreciation of the merits of cycling are well recognised  in addition motivators and barriers are similar to the wider population  however more research is required  especially with occasional and non cyclists  to understand how best to address the  value action  gap highlighted between cycling attitudes and behaviour amongst university students

 a day to day route flow evolution process towards the mixed equilibria this study investigates a travelers  day to day route flow evolution process under a predefined market penetration of advanced traveler information system  atis   it is assumed that some travelers equipped with atis will follow the deterministic user equilibrium route choice behavior due to the complete traffic information provided by atis  while the other travelers unequipped with atis will follow the stochastic user equilibrium route choice behavior  the interaction between these two groups of travelers will result in a mixed equilibrium state  we first propose a discrete day to day route flow adjustment process for this mixed equilibrium behavior by specifying the travelers  route adjustment principle and adjustment ratio  the convergence of the proposed day to day flow dynamic model to the mixed equilibrium state is then rigofously demonstrated under certain assumptions upon route adjustment principle and adjustment ratio  in addition  without affecting the convergence of the proposed day to day flow dynamic model  the assumption concerning the adjustment ratio is further relaxed  thus making the proposed model more appealing in practice  finally  numerical experiments are conducted to illustrate and evaluate the performance of the proposed day to day flow dynamic model   c  2017 elsevier ltd  all rights reserved  
 a decision framework for successful private participation in the airport sector as private participation in public airports becomes a global trend  there are a number of concerns and debates over the conflicting interests of the private and public sectors  for instance  the private sector s interest in maximizing profits often opposes the public sector s interest in protecting the public interest and social welfare  in this paper  we reframe the conflict in terms of principal agent theory  and inform policymakers to understand public private management problems in a broader context  firstly  we demonstrate how various ownership and governance structures shape the private participation based on  1  ownership type   2  mode of ownership shift  and  3  ex post government control  secondly  we then highlight that this process should be context based  and examine the recent case of incheon international airport  iia  in south korea to illustrate the importance of contextual factors  lastly  we provide comprehensive recommendations to policymakers involved in bringing private partners into the airport sector  which include setting a clear agenda  exercising a reasonable level of control  understanding the sharing of risk and responsibility under different structures  and assessing technical  economic and political factors that may affect the policy outcome   c  2017 elsevier ltd  all rights reserved

 a discrete choice framework for modeling and forecasting the adoption and diffusion of new transportation services major technological and infrastructural changes over the next decades  such as the introduction of autonomous vehicles  implementation of mileage based fees  carsharing and ridesharing are expected to have a profound impact on lifestyles and travel behavior  current travel demand models are unable to predict long range trends in travel behavior as they do not entail a mechanism that projects membership and market share of new modes of transport  uber  lyft  etc    we propose integrating discrete choice and technology adoption models to address the aforementioned issue  in order to do so  we build on the formulation of discrete mixture models and specifically latent class choice models  lccms   which were integrated with a network effect model  the network effect model quantifies the impact of the spatial network effect of the new technology on the utility of adoption  we adopted a confirmatory approach to estimating our dynamic lccm based on findings from the technology diffusion literature that focus on defining two distinct types of adopters  innovator early adopters and imitators  lccms allow for heterogeneity in the utility of adoption for the various market segments i e  innovators early adopters  imitators and non adopters  we make use of revealed preference  rp  time series data from a one way carsharing system in a major city in the united states to estimate model parameters  the data entails a complete set of member enrollment for the carsharing service for a time period of 2 5 years after being launched  consistent with the technology diffusion literature  our model identifies three latent classes whose utility of adoption have a well defined set of preferences that are significant and behaviorally consistent  the technology adoption model predicts the probability that a certain individual will adopt the service at a certain time period  and is explained by social influences  network effect  sociodemographics and level of service attributes  finally  the model was calibrated and then used to forecast adoption of the carsharing system for potential investment strategy scenarios  a couple of takeaways from the adoption forecasts were   1  placing a new station pod for the carsharing system outside a major technology firm induces the highest expected increase in the monthly number of adopters  and  2  no significant difference in the expected number of monthly adopters for the downtown region will exist between having a station or on street parking   c  2017 elsevier ltd  all rights reserved  
 a downtown on street parking model with urban truck delivery behavior in this study we present an on street parking model for downtowns in urban centers that incorporates the often neglected delivery demand of delivery trucks  the behavior of truck deliveries is distinctly different from commuter parking  trucks do not cruise for parking spaces  and demand for goods delivery is driven by customers and is practically inelastic to the delivery costs  we generalize the downtown on street parking model from arnott and inci  2006  to study the relationship between passenger vehicles  parking and truck delivery behaviors  and provide tools for policy makers to optimize the trade offs in parking space allocation  pricing  and aggregate network congestion  the social optimum can be obtained by solving a nonlinear optimization problem  the parking model is able to replicate the commuter only scenario as a special case  it is shown that ignoring truck delivery behavior can significantly overestimate travel speeds and cruising stock  we applied the model to a case study of downtown toronto and found that compared to a baseline scenario representative of toronto in 2015  increasing parking fees from cad  4 h to nearly cad  7 85 h and assigning 4 1  of parking spaces to truck deliveries would eliminate cruising and truck double parking  resulting in a social surplus gain of over cad  14 304 h  mile 2   in a first best allocation scenario where total parking spaces can also change  we found that increasing total parking spaces by 18   having 3 5  truck delivery allocation  and reducing parking fees to cad  2 47 h would eliminate cruising and double parking while increasing social surplus by cad  24 883  h mile 2   these model findings are along the same level of effect as demonstrated in the literature   c  2016 elsevier ltd  all rights reserved  
 a dynamic programming approach for optimizing train speed profiles with speed restrictions and passage points this paper considers a novel solution method for generating improved train speed profiles with reduced energy consumption  the solution method makes use of a time space graph formulation which can be solved through dynamic programming  instead of using uniform discretization of time and space as seen previously in the literature  we rely on an event based decomposition that drastically reduces the search space  this approach is very flexible  making it easy to handle  e g   speed limits  changes in altitude  and passage points that need to be crossed within a given time window  based on solving an extensive number of real life problem instances  our benchmarks show that the proposed solution method is able to satisfy all secondary constraints and still be able to decrease energy consumption by 3 3  on average compared to a commercial solver provided by our industrial collaborator  cubris  the computational times are generally very low  making it possible to recompute the train speed profile in case of unexpected changes in speed restrictions or timings  this is a great advantage over static offline lookup tables  also  the framework is very flexible  making it possible to handle a number of additional constraints on robustness  passenger comfort etc  selected details of the method and benchmark are only described at a high level for confidentiality reasons   c  2016 elsevier ltd  all rights reserved  
 a dynamic taxi traffic assignment model  a two level continuum transportation system approach this paper proposes a two  level continuum transportation system approach to modeling a dynamic taxi traffic assignment  dtta  problem in a dense network with real time traffic information provision and three types of vehicles  including private cars  occupied taxis  and vacant taxis  the proposed approach treats the dense network as a continuum in the first level  in which private car and occupied taxi drivers are free to choose their paths in a two dimensional continuous space  the proposed approach also divides the modeling region into many identical squares to form a cell based network in the second level  in which the cells are classified into two categories  target cell with an acceptable expected rate of return  eror  to vacant taxi drivers and non  target cell with an unacceptable eror  the eror associated with a cell is the ratio of the cumulative expected profit of a taxi driver who successfully picks up a customer during the customer search that starts from that cell to the sum of expected search time for this customer and expected occupied travel time to serve this customer  based on the cell  based network  we develop a cell  based intervening opportunity model to capture the fact that vacant taxi drivers can meet a customer on the way to their destination zones and estimate the eror each vacant taxi driver has a mixed strategy to determine his her customer  search direction according to the eror  each vacant taxi driver in a target cell selects its neighbor cells with maximum eror  and each vacant taxi driver in a non target cell selects the travel time  based shortest path to his her target cell  meanwhile  each private car driver chooses the path that minimizes his her own generalized travel cost  and each occupied taxi driver chooses the path that minimizes his her customer s generalized in vehicle travel cost  in our model  traffic density in the system is governed by the conservation law  cl   and the flow directions of different vehicles are determined by the path choice strategies of their drivers  which are captured by hamilton jacobi  hj  equations  both the proposed cl and hj equations can be solved by the lax friedrichs scheme  which forms the backbone of the developed solution algorithm  finally  numerical examples and a case study are used to demonstrate the properties of the model  the performance of the solution algorithm  and the value of using our methodology for estimating network performance   c  2017 elsevier ltd  all rights reserved  
 a fast simulation algorithm for multiple moving bottlenecks and applications in urban freight traffic management moving bottlenecks are moving capacity restrictions that affect traffic flows  and they can be used to describe the effects of buses and trucks in transportation networks  the computation of solutions associated with the presence of moving bottlenecks is complex  since they both influence and are influenced by surrounding traffic  in this study  we propose a fast numerical scheme that can efficiently compute the solutions to an arbitrary number of moving  and fixed  bottlenecks  for a stretch of road modeled by the lighthil lwhitham richards  lwr  model  several different moving bottlenecks can be simulated endogenously all together by means of an algorithm based on a semi analytic lax hopf formula  since the numerical scheme is semi analytic and requires a very low number of operations  it can be employed for traffic estimation problems where fast and accurate solutions are required  we demonstrate the capabilities of the method by implementing two alternative traffic management strategies designed to minimize the negative impacts of trucks and buses in urban environments   c  2017 elsevier ltd  all rights reserved

 a first order behavioral model of capacity drop understanding traffic dynamics at lane drop bottlenecks  especially the mechanism of capacity drop  is critical for developing and evaluating centralized and decentralized control strategies in a freeway system  in this study  we propose a first order behavioral model of capacity drop at a continuous lane drop bottleneck  by extending the theoretical framework for analytically solving the generalized riemann problem in jin  2017   we introduce vehicles  bounded acceleration on the lwr  lighthill whitham richards  stationary states inside the lane drop zone as an additional constraint for the optimization formulation of the entropy condition  we demonstrate that the optimization problem is uniquely solved with well defined instantaneous continuous standing waves  comprised of the lwr stationary states inside the lane drop and the bounded acceleration stationary states in the downstream acceleration zones  in the solutions to the generalized riemann problem  the boundary flux as well as the stationary states and kinematic waves on both upstream and downstream links are the same as those in the phenomenological model of capacity drop proposed in jin et al   2015   this is a behavioral model of capacity drop  since both the dropped capacity and the capacity drop ratio are endogenous and can be calculated from the factors related to the fundamental diagram  road geometry  bounded acceleration  and lane changes  we present the cell transmission model for the behavioral and phenomenological models and verify the theoretical results with numerical examples  we calibrate and validate the model with observed stationary speeds at a lane drop bottleneck  combined with jin  2017   this study provides a proof of the conjecture by hall and agyemang duah  1991  that capacity drop results from the acceleration process when  drivers accelerate away from the  upstream  queue    c  2017 elsevier ltd  all rights reserved  
 a forecast air pollution model applied to a hypothetical urban road pricing scheme  an empirical study in madrid reducing the air pollution from increases in traffic congestion in large cities and their surroundings is an important problem that requires changes in travel behavior  road pricing is an effective tool for reducing air pollution  as reflected currently urban road pricing outcomes  singapore  london  stockholm and milan   a survey was conducted based on establishing a hypothetical urban road pricing system in madrid  a random sample size n   1298   we developed a forecast air pollution model with time series analysis to evaluate the consequences of possible air pollution decreases in madrid  results reveal that the hypothetical road pricing for madrid could have highly significant effects on decreasing air pollution outside of the city and in the inner city during the peak operating time periods of maximum congestion  morning peak hours from 7 00 to 10 00 and evening peak hours from 18 00 to 20 00   furthermore  this system could have significant positive effects on a shift toward using public transport and non motorized modes inside the hypothetical toll zone  this reveals that the system has a high capacity to motivate a decrease in air pollution and impose more sustainable behavior for public transport users   c  2017 elsevier ltd  all rights reserved  
 a full bayesian approach to appraise the safety effects of pedestrian countdown signals to drivers although they are meant for pedestrians  pedestrian countdown signals  pcss  give cues to drivers about the length of the remaining green phase  hence affecting drivers  behavior at intersections  this study focuses on the evaluation of the safety effectiveness of pcss to drivers  in the cities of jacksonville and gainesville  florida  using crash modification factors  cmfs  and crash modification functions  cmfunctions   a full bayes  fb  before and after with comparison group method was used to quantify the safety impacts of pcss to drivers  the cmfs were established for distinctive categories of crashes based on crash type  rear end and angle collisions  and severity level  total  fatal and injury  fl   and property damage only  pdo  collisions   the cmfs findings indicated that installing pcss result in a significant improvement of drivers  safety  at a 95  bayesian credible interval  bci   for total  pdo  and rear end collisions  the results of fi and angle crashes were not significant  the cmfunctions indicate that the treatment effectiveness varies considerably with post treatment time and traffic volume  nevertheless  the cmfs on rear end crashes are observed to decline with post treatment time  in summary  the results suggest the usefulness of pcss for drivers  the findings of this study may prompt a need for a broader research to investigate the need to design pcss that will serve the purpose not only of pedestrians  but drivers as well  
 a game theoretic model of car ownership and household time allocation the explosive growth of private cars in china and other developing countries has attracted a great deal of renewed research interest in car ownership  this paper investigates households  car ownership decision making process from the perspective of household time allocation  applying the game theoretic approach to capturing household members  interactive decision making mechanism  we propose a two stage model that links household members  short term time allocation decisions to long term car ownership decisions  the first stage models the bargaining of household members  e g   husband and wife  over the car ownership decision  taking into consideration of government policies for regulating car ownership  and the second stage is a generalized nash equilibrium model for activity travel pattern analysis incorporating individuals  interactions concerning activity participation  the existence and uniqueness of the generalized nash equilibrium solution is examined  and a heuristic procedure that combines backwards induction and method of exhaustion is adopted to solve the two stage game  the proposed model is applied to an empirical case study in beijing  which demonstrates the applicability of the model in predicting car ownership and examining interactions between car ownership and household time allocation  the empirical model is applied to assess the impacts of plate number based vehicle usage rationing policies on car ownership and time allocation to travel and daily activities  results show that the model can be applied to evaluate the car ownership impacts of car usage rationing policies   c  2017 published by elsevier ltd  
 a general equilibrium framework for integrated assessment of transport and economic impacts the use of separate transport and economic models in urban planning provides a limited view of economic impacts  restricts the testing of network design options and lengthens the planning process  furthermore  the standard methodology for economic appraisal assumes partial economic equilibrium and cannot determine the distribution of impacts from the transport sector to households  computable general equilibrium  cge  models can capture general equilibrium effects and measure welfare at the household level  but mostly lack integration with transport models and do not represent all trip generators  this paper develops an integrated traffic assignment and spatial cge model in nonlinear complementarity form  casted as a framework for economic appraisal of urban transport projects  the cge submodel generates commuting  shopping and leisure trips as inputs into the transport submodel  which then assigns trips to the network according to user equilibrium  the resulting travel times then feed back into household prices and freight margins  households and firms fully account for travel times in decisions on where to shop  how much labour to supply and where to source production inputs  calibration and applications of the model are demonstrated for 14 regions and 2 industries across sydney using gams path on the neos server  the welfare of various network improvements is measured using equivalent variations  the model can be calibrated to external strategic transport models  and be extended to simulate additional trip generators and land use  
 a general iterative approach for the system level joint optimization of pavement maintenance  rehabilitation  and reconstruction planning we formulate a general bottom up model for the joint optimization of maintenance  rehabilitation  and reconstruction  mr r  schedules for a system of heterogeneous pavement segments under budget constraints  the objective is to minimize the total costs incurred to both the highway users and the pavement management agency  we propose a lagrange multiplier approach together with derivative free quasi newton algorithms to solve the problem for two scenarios  i  with a combined budget constraint for all the treatments  and ii  with one budget constraint for each treatment  the system level solution approach has the following merits  i  it can be applied to problems with any forms of segment level models for user and agency costs  deterioration process  and treatment effectiveness  given that the solution to the segment level problem is available  ii  under the combined budget constraint  it ensures that the optimality gap of the system level solution is bounded by a term that depends upon the optimality gap of the segment level solutions  and iii  it exhibits linear complexity with the number of segments  at the segment level  a new maintenance effectiveness model fitted on empirical data is proposed and incorporated into the mr r optimization program  a greedy heuristic algorithm is developed  which greatly reduces the computation time without compromising the solution quality  combining the system  and segment level models and solution algorithms  we examine a batch of numerical cases  the results show considerable cost savings from the incorporation of maintenance  and from jointly optimizing the use of a combined agency budget  a number of managerial insights stemmed from the numerical case studies are discussed  which can help highway agencies formulate more cost efficient mr r plans and budget allocation   c  2017 elsevier ltd  all rights reserved  
 a generalized exponential link function to map a conflict indicator into severity index within safety continuum framework traffic conflict indicators measure the temporal and spatial proximity of conflict  involved road users  these indicators can reflect the severity of traffic conflicts to a reliable extent  instead of using the indicator value directly as a severity index  many link functions have been developed to map the conflict indicator to a severity index  however  little information is available about the choice of a particular link function  to guard against link misspecification or subjectivity  a generalized exponential link function was developed  the severity index generated by this link was introduced to a parametric safety continuum model which objectively models the centre and tail regions  an empirical method  together with full bayesian estimation method was adopted to estimate model parameters  the safety implication of return level was calculated based on the model parameters  the proposed approach was applied to the conflict and crash data collected from 21 segments from three freeways located in guangdong province  china  the pearson s correlation test between return levels and observed crashes showed that a theta value of 1 2 was the best choice of the generalized parameter for current data set  this provides statistical support for using the generalized exponential link function  with the determined generalized exponential link function  the visualization of parametric safety continuum was found to be a gyroscope shaped hierarchy   c  2017 elsevier ltd  all rights reserved  
 a generalized method to extract visual time sharing sequences from naturalistic driving data indicators based on visual time sharing have been used to investigate drivers  visual behaviour during additional task execution  however  visual time sharing analyses have been restricted to additional tasks with well defined temporal start and end points and a dedicated visual target area  we introduce a method to automatically extract visual time sharing sequences directly from eye tracking data  this facilitates investigations of systems  providing continuous information without well defined start and end points  furthermore  it becomes possible to investigate time sharing behavior with other types of glance targets such as the mirrors  time sharing sequences are here extracted based on between glance durations  if glances to a particular target are separated by less than a time based threshold value  we assume that they belong to the same information intake event  our results indicate that a 4 s threshold is appropriate  examples derived from 12 drivers  about 100 hours of eye tracking data   collected in an on road investigation of an in vehicle information system  are provided to illustrate sequence based analyses  this includes the possibility to investigate human machine interface designs based on the number of glances in the extracted sequences  and to increase the legibility of transition matrices by deriving them from time sharing sequences instead of single glances  more object oriented glance behavior analyses  based on additional sensor and information fusion  are identified as the next future step  this would enable automated extraction of time sharing sequences not only for targets fixed in the vehicle s coordinate system  but also for environmental and traffic targets that move independently of the driver s vehicle  
 a generic discrete choice model of automobile purchase purpose the introduction of novel fuel and propulsion technologies  such as battery   plug in  hybrid and fuel cell electric vehicles  and the need to combat the exhaust emission of local and global pollutants from the passenger car fleet have enhanced the political interest in the vehicle purchase choices made by private households and firms  and in how these choices can be influenced through fiscal and regulatory penalties and incentives  methods as a tool to understand and analyse such questions  we have developed a generic nested logit model of automobile choice  based on complete disaggregate vehicle sales data for norway for the period ranging from january 1996 until july 2011  the data set contains 1 6 million vehicle transactions  results being sensitive to changes in the vehicle purchase tax and the fuel tax  the model discriminates well between various fiscal policy scenarios  in using the model for such purposes  one is greatly helped by the fact that the model distinguishes between price changes due to taxation and those originating from the manufacturing or marketing side  conclusions the strongly co2 graduated vehicle purchase tax  with exemptions granted for battery electric vehicles  is shown to have a major impact on the average type approval rate of co2 emissions from new passenger cars registered in norway  the fuel tax also helps induce car customers to buy low emission vehicles

 a heuristic approach for solving an integrated gate reassignment and taxi scheduling probleme capacity limitation of airport ground operation is one of the major limiting factors in air traffic operation  the congestion on the gate and taxiway causes severe delay and propagate effect on the flight schedule  this paper considers the problem of integrated gate reassignment and taxiway scheduling  in which complex constraints related to runway restriction  gate allocation and taxiway conflict are all incorporated when determining the schedule  to solve this problem  we propose a novel heuristic approach  first  all possible aircraft schedules are enumerated by disretizing the waiting time along the path  then  the cost is evaluated for each schedule and the conflict detection is conducted to generate constraint sets  finally  we propose a set partition model  in which each decision variable denotes a candidate schedule that takes into account the possible constraints when generated  this method is compared with a sequential method that solves gate reassignment and taxiway scheduling problem separately  computational results highlight the strength of our method   c  2017 elsevier ltd  all rights reserved  
 a holistic approach to evaluating the effect of safety barriers on the performance of safety reporting systems in aviation organisations safety reporting systems are a necessary component of any safety management system  sms  in contemporary aviation organisations  improving the performance of safety reporting systems can significantly enhance the reliability of safety information and allow the implementation of more effective risk assessment processes  previous researchers have identified several barriers that influence the effectiveness of safety reporting systems  ranging from individual barriers to organisational issues  however  none of these studies has addressed the concomitant effect of the different barriers as a means of determining the overall effect on the performance of existing reporting systems  this paper proposes a holistic approach to this problem by developing a model that can help to determine the cumulative effect of organisational  working environment and individual barriers on the performance of a safety reporting system in an aviation organisation  the partial least squares structural equation modelling  pls sem  technique was used to examine the relationships amongst the different variables considered in our study  the model was constructed using a broad range of data collected from a survey conducted in a military aviation organisation  with the purpose of identifying the barriers to reporting in this particular context  results show that the proposed model allows to accurately quantify the impact of the various concomitant barriers in the reporting system  providing a powerful resource to assist stakeholders in the decision making process that is inherent to the implementation of tailored actions to improve the safety performance of aviation organisations   c  2017 elsevier ltd  all rights reserved  
 a hybrid fuzzy mcdm approach for mitigating airport congestion  a case in ninoy aquino international airport in this paper  we introduce the application of an integrated fuzzy multi criteria decision making  mcdm  model to mitigate airport congestion which affects the on time performance of airlines  operational reputation of airports  and air travel experience of passengers  in a classical approach  when congestion occurs at the destination airport while the aircraft is en route  an air traffic flow management action is prompted for implementation  in selecting the most suitable action in the event of airport congestion  the decision must reflect the multiple criteria nature of the problem as well as the uncertainty and vagueness associated with the decision making process  thus  an integrated fuzzy mcdm is adopted  the applicability of the proposed approach is demonstrated in a case study at ninoy aquino international airport  it is found that stakeholders of the commercial aviation industry favored to apply rerouting  among other actions  as this satisfies aviation safety as the most prioritized criterion   c  2017 elsevier ltd  all rights reserved  
 a hybrid optimization simulation approach for robust weekly aircraft routing and retiming we address the robust weekly aircraft routing and retiming problem  which requires determining weekly schedules for a heterogeneous fleet that maximizes the aircraft on time performance  minimizes the total delay  and minimizes the number of delayed passengers  the fleet is required to serve a set of flights having known departure time windows while satisfying maintenance constraints  all flights are subject to random delays that may propagate through the network  we propose to solve this problem using a hybrid optimization simulation approach based on a novel mixed integer nonlinear programming model for the robust weekly aircraft maintenance routing problem  for this model  we provide an equivalent mixed integer linear programming formulation that can be solved using a commercial solver  furthermore  we describe a monte carlo based procedure for sequentially adjusting the flight departure times  we perform an extensive computational study using instances obtained from a major international airline  having up to 3387 flights and 164 aircraft  which demonstrates the efficacy of the proposed approach  using the simulation software simair to assess the robustness of the solutions produced by our approach in comparison with that for the original solutions implemented by the airline  we found that on time performance was improved by 9 8 16 0   cumulative delay was reduced by 25 4 33 1   and the number of delayed passengers was reduced by 8 2 51 6    c  2017 elsevier ltd  all rights reserved  
 a large neighborhood search heuristic to establish an optimal ad hoc hubbing strategy in the wake of a large scale airport outage abrupt airport outages can cause diversions and fuel critical situations for flights  leading to costly passenger misconnections  we develop a large neighborhood search heuristic to optimize the rerouting of flights bound for a disrupted airport to a hub airport that is not disrupted  with the goal of accommodating passengers on existing flights departing the non disrupted hub  the objective of the heuristic is to identify and reroute flights to the ad hoc hub s  non disrupted hub airport s  that minimize the sum of passenger travel time and wait time  we minimize the passenger cost as the sum of passenger travel time to the diversion airport and wait time for a connecting flight at the ad hoc hub airport  subject to on board fuel and diversion airport capacity constraints  we use the heuristic to determine how a coordinated traffic management strategy could have diverted flights immediately following a real world airport outage   c  2017 elsevier ltd  all rights reserved

 a life course perspective on the travel of australian millennials recent research suggests that the millennial generation may be inclined to more sustainable travel habits than previous generations  reflected in lower rates of driver licensing in many countries and greater use of sustainable modes in others  however  it is still unknown whether millennials will continue to use sustainable transport modes as they age  or whether their travel patterns will revert to the car dependence displayed by previous generations  this research addresses this overlooked area in the travel behaviour research through an in depth  qualitative prospective exploration of the interactions between life course and mobility of millennials in three australian cities  sydney  melbourne and canberra   drawing from life course transition research  fifty five in depth interviews found that australian millennial life courses could be categorised into three typologies   a  traditional   b  delayed traditional and  c  non traditional uncertain  in addition  millennial mobility was categorised into four typologies   a  choice multi modals   b  captive multi modals   c  choice drivers and  d  captive drivers  many millennials preferred living in inner urban areas  were multi modal and somewhat  mode agnostic   open to using whatever travel mode best suited their needs  very few showed a strong preference for cars  however  the research does suggest that as millennials approach adult milestones such as having children  the difficulty in finding suitable housing near transit may push some of them into neighbourhoods where sustainable transport is no longer a practical option  policy interventions that support a sustainable lifestyle are suggested and research directions are discussed   c  2017 elsevier ltd  all rights reserved

 a meta analysis of in vehicle and nomadic voice recognition system interaction and driving performance driver distraction is a growing and pervasive issue that requires multiple solutions  voice recognition  v r  systems may decrease the visual manual  v m  demands of a wide range of in vehicle system and smartphone interactions  however  the degree that v r systems integrated into vehicles or available in mobile phone applications affect driver distraction is incompletely understood  a comprehensive meta analysis of experimental studies was conducted to address this knowledge gap  to meet study inclusion criteria  drivers had to interact with a v r system while driving and doing everyday v r tasks such as dialing  initiating a call  texting  emailing  destination entry or music selection  coded dependent variables included detection  reaction time  lateral position  speed and headway  comparisons of v r systems with baseline driving and or a v m condition were also coded  of 817 identified citations  43 studies involving 2000 drivers and 183 effect sizes  r  were analyzed in the meta analysis  compared to baseline  driving while interacting with a v r system is associated with increases in reaction time and lane positioning  and decreases in detection  when v m systems were compared to v r systems  drivers had slightly better performance with the latter system on reaction time  lane positioning and headway  although v r systems have some driving performance advantages over v m systems  they have a distraction cost relative to driving without any system at all  the pattern of results indicates that v r systems impose moderate distraction costs on driving  in addition  drivers minimally engage in compensatory performance adjustments such as reducing speed and increasing headway while using v r systems  implications of the results for theory  design guidelines and future research are discussed  
 a method of emission and traveller behavior analysis under multimodal traffic condition the growth of urban traffic in recent decades has led to environmental problems in terms of increased emissions  in some cities located along waterfronts  multimodal transportation that includes ferry trips plays an important role in public transportation  compared with roadway traffic  ferry service can often provide shorter routes between given origins and destinations as well as reduce emissions  however  in some areas with high ferry demand  travel delay occurs frequently because of traffic congestion caused by drivers waiting to board the ferry  which can significantly increase travel time and decrease its reliability  in addition  changes in other factors  such as fuel prices  also may influence drivers  decision making processes in terms of route choice  in this paper  a study focusing on travel time and travel time reliability of ferry service during peak travel periods is performed  furthermore  as a key result an emission loss model under multimodal conditions is developed that also takes travel cost into account  the analysis of route choice is conducted based on a mixed logit model which is able to handle individual preference  based upon validation with data from the seattle area  the proposed model is verified as an efficient way to analyse emission factors in a multimodal transportation environment   c  2017 elsevier ltd  all rights reserved  
 a methodological framework of travel time distribution estimation for urban signalized arterial roads urban travel times are rather variable as a result of a lot of stochastic factors both in traffic flows  signals  and other conditions on the infrastructure  however  the most common way both in literature and practice is to estimate or predict only expected travel times  not travel time distributions  by doing so  it fails to provide full insight into the travel time dynamics and variability on urban roads  another limitation of this common approach is that the effect of traffic measures on travel time reliability cannot be evaluated  in this paper  an analytical travel time distribution model is presented especially for urban roads with fixed time controlled intersections by investigating the underlying mechanisms of urban travel times  different from mean travel time models or deterministic travel time models  the proposed model takes stochastic properties of traffic flow  stochastic arrivals and departures at intersections  and traffic signal coordination between adjacent intersections into account  and therefore  is able to capture the delay dynamics and uncertainty at intersections  the queue spillback phenomenon is explicitly taken into account by applying shockwave theory in a probabilistic way  the proposed model was further validated with both vissim simulation data and field gps data collected in a chinese city  the results demonstrate that the travel time distributions derived from the analytical model can well represent those from vissim simulation  the comparison with field gps data shows that the model estimated link and trip travel time distributions can also represent the field travel time distributions  though a small discrepancy can be observed in both middle range travel times and higher travel times

 a methodology to design heuristics for model selection based on the characteristics of data  application to investigate when the negative binomial lindley  nb l  is preferred over the negative binomial  nb  safety analysts usually use post modeling methods  such as the goodness of fit statistics or the likelihood ratio test  to decide between two or more competitive distributions or models  such metrics require all competitive distributions to be fitted to the data before any comparisons can be accomplished  given the continuous growth in introducing new statistical distributions  choosing the best one using such post modeling methods is not a trivial task  in addition to all theoretical or numerical issues the analyst may face during the analysis  furthermore  and most importantly  these measures or tests do not provide any intuitions into why a specific distribution  or model  is preferred over another  goodness of logic   this paper ponders into these issues by proposing a methodology to design heuristics for model selection based on the characteristics of data  in terms of descriptive summary statistics  before fitting the models  the proposed methodology employs two analytic tools   1  monte carlo simulations and  2  machine learning classifiers  to design easy heuristics to predict the label of the  most likely true  distribution for analyzing data  the proposed methodology was applied to investigate when the recently introduced negative binomial lindley  nb l  distribution is preferred over the negative binomial  nb  distribution  heuristics were designed to select the  most likely true  distribution between these two distributions  given a set of prescribed summary statistics of data  the proposed heuristics were successfully compared against classical tests for several real or observed datasets  not only they are easy to use and do not need any post modeling inputs  but also  using these heuristics  the analyst can attain useful information about why the nb l is preferred over the nb   or vice versa  when modeling data  
 a microscopic investigation into the capacity drop  impacts of longitudinal behavior on the queue discharge rate the capacity drop indicates that the queue discharge rate is lower than the free flow capacity  studies show that the queue discharge rate varies under different traffic conditions  empirical data show that the queue discharge rate increases as the speed in congestion increases  insights into the underlying behavioral mechanisms that cause these variable queue discharge rates can help minimize traffic delays and eliminate congestion  however  to our knowledge  few efforts have been devoted to testing impacts of traffic behaviors on the queue discharge rate  this paper tries to fill this gap  we investigate to what extent the acceleration spread and reaction time can influence the queue discharge rate  it is found that the  interdriver  acceleration spread does not reduce the queue discharge rates as much as found empirically  modeling reaction time might be more important than modeling acceleration for capacity drop in car following models  a speed dependent reaction time mechanism for giving variable queue discharge rates is proposed  that is  decreasing reaction time as the speed in congestion increases can give the same queue discharge rate as found empirically  this research suggests that motivating drivers to speed up earlier could increase the queue discharge rate and thereby minimize delays  
 a microscopic model for optimal train short turnings during complete blockages currently railway traffic controllers use predefined solutions  contingency plans  to deal with a disruption  these plans are manually designed by expert traffic controllers and are specific to a certain location and timetable  with a slight change in the timetable or infrastructure  these plans might not be feasible and have to be updated  instead traffic controllers can benefit from algorithms that can quickly compute an optimal solution given a disruption specification  this paper presents a mixed integer linear programming model to compute a disruption timetable when there is a complete blockage and no train can use part of the track for several hours  the model computes the optimal short turning stations  routes and platform tracks  in this approach short turning as a common practice in case of complete blockages is modelled at a microscopic level of operational and infrastructural detail to guarantee feasibility of the solution  to demonstrate the functionality and applicability of the model two case studies are performed on two dutch railway corridors  in the first case  four experiments are presented to show how different priorities can change the optimal solution including the order of services and the choice of short turning station  in the second case the performance of the model on a big station is investigated  it is shown that the model can compute the optimal solution in a short time   c  2017 elsevier ltd  all rights reserved

 a multi class model based control scheme for reducing congestion and emissions in freeway networks by combining ramp metering and route guidance the paper proposes a multi class control scheme for freeway traffic networks  this control scheme combines two control strategies  i e  ramp metering and route guidance  in order to reduce the total time spent and the total emissions in a balanced way  in particular  the ramp metering and route guidance controllers are feedback predictive controllers  i e  they compute the control actions not only on the basis of the measured system state  but also on the basis of the prediction of the system evolution  in terms of traffic conditions and traffic emissions  another important feature of the controllers is that they have a multi class nature  different classes of vehicles are considered and specific control actions are computed for each class  since the controllers are based on a set of parameters that need to be tuned  the overall control framework also includes a module to properly determine the gains of the controllers  the simulation analysis reported in the paper shows the effectiveness of the proposed control framework and  in particular  the possibility of implementing control policies that are specific for each vehicle type   c  2017 elsevier ltd  all rights reserved

 a new insight on the risky behavior of motorists at railway level crossings  an observational field study accidents at railway level crossings  lxs  give rise to serious material and human damage  particularly  collisions between trains and motorized vehicles are the most critical accidents occurring at lxs  it is worth noticing that violations committed by vehicle drivers are the primary cause of such accidents  the present study is a tentative to acquire a better understanding of risky behavior of vehicle drivers while crossing lxs during the closure cycle  namely  risk analysis based on field measurement conducted at four automated lxs with two half barriers is performed  we focus on vehicle driver behavior during the lx closure cycle while distinguishing between different phases  in fact  the closure cycle is divided into three phases which are  ph2 red flash and siren    ph3 barriers coming down  and  ph4 barriers down   and vehicle driver behavior in each phase as time increases is scrutinized respectively  particularly  zigzag scenarios are detected  using an original experimental setting that we have implemented  and analyzed in detail  the main findings based on the analysis demonstrate that the peak of violation rate in the morning is later than the actual rush hour in the morning  a distinct peak of the violation rate shows on friday  while the violation rate on weekend is fairly low  the relative violation rate of vehicles with high speed decreases continuously as time advances from ph2 to ph3 in the daytime  the violation rate during ph4 decreases as ph4 duration is prolonged  which contradicts a general speculation that a higher rate of zigzag violations would appear as the duration of ph4 is extended  these findings open the way towards determining the impacting factors which have an important contribution to the vehicle driver decision making in this context  e g   traffic density  time schedule and phase duration   in addition  the outputs of the present study are conducive to identifying potential interventions to improve safety at lxs

 a parallel branch and bound algorithm for the resource leveling problem with minimal lags the efficient use of resources is a key factor to minimize the cost while meeting time deadlines and quality requirements  this is especially important in construction projects where field operations make fluctuations of resources unproductive and costly  resource leveling problems  rlp  aim to sequence the construction activities that maximize the resource consumption efficiency over time  minimizing the variability  exact algorithms for the rlp have been proposed throughout the years to offer optimal solutions  however  these problems require a vast computational capability   combinatorial explosion   that makes them unpractical  therefore  alternative heuristic and metaheuristic algorithms have been suggested in the literature to find local optimal solutions  using different libraries to benchmark optimal values  for example  the project scheduling problem library for minimal lags is still open to be solved to optimality for rlp  to partially fill this gap  the authors propose a parallel branch and bound algorithm for the rlp with minimal lags to solve the rlp with an acceptable computational effort  this way  this research contributes to the body of knowledge of construction project scheduling providing the optimums of 50 problems for the rlp with minimal lags for the first time  allowing future contributors to benchmark their heuristics methods against exact results by obtaining the distance of their solution to the optimal values  furthermore  for practitioners  the time required to solve this kind of problem is reasonable and practical  considering that unbalanced resources can risk the goals of the construction project  
 a parametric description of cities for the normative analysis of transport systems urban transport systems analysis requires some explicit or implicit representation of the network  activity pattern and flows pattern of the city  when dealing with transit design in real systems  detailed descriptions of cities are too complex to allow an analytical formulation that leads to exact results  so heuristics have been used  alternatively  optimal design of transit systems at a strategic level has been done based on simplified descriptions using regular patterns or small networks to face and solve ad hoc transit design problems  in this paper we propose a parametric description of cities for the normative analysis of transit systems  this is achieved after a synthesis of different ways to describe a city s urban form that can be found in the literature  with an emphasis on the road network and the role of centers and subcenters  these diverse descriptions are assessed with the help of topological indicators and synthetic information regarding real cities  the parameters characterize the underlying network  the zones involved and the spatial pattern of transport demand  such that the design of public transport systems can be studied normatively for different city shapes  the model is applied to describe three very different real cities

 a probabilistic passenger to train assignment model based on automated data the paper presents a methodology for assigning passengers to individual trains using   i  fare transaction records from automatic fare collection  afc  systems and  ii  automatic vehicle location  avl  data from train tracking systems  the proposed passenger to train assignment model  ptam  is probabilistic and links each fare transaction to a set of feasible train itineraries  the method estimates the probability of the passenger boarding each feasible train  and the probability distribution of the number of trains a passenger is unable to board due to capacity constraints  the access egress time distributions are important inputs to the model  the paper also suggests a maximum likelihood approach to estimate these distributions from afc and avl data  the methodology is applied in a case study with data from a major  congested  subway system during peak hours  based on actual afc and train tracking data  synthetic data was generated to validate the model  the results  both in terms of the trains passengers are assigned to and train loads  are similar to the  true  observations from the synthetic data  the probability of a passenger being left behind  due to capacity constraints  in the actual system is also estimated by time of day and compared with survey data collected by the agency at the same station  the left behind probabilities can be accurately estimated from the assignment results  furthermore  it is shown that the ptam output can also be used to estimate crowding metrics at transfer stations   c  2017 elsevier ltd  all rights reserved  
 a probability based indicator for measuring the degree of multimodality in transportation investments although decision makers may favor a  multimodal  transportation system  it can be difficult to indicate the extent to which a given transportation investment is  or is not  multimodal  this lack of an indicator can be acute when the project selection process requires consideration of how a given investment supports increased multimodality  in response to this need  this research reports on a taxonomy for classifying the degree of multimodality for transportation projects  probability theory was employed with principal component analysis to create a new indicator based on both demand  modal shares  and supply  monetary investment for each mode   the indicator offers three main benefits in the area of performance measurement   1  it is applicable in cases when some data are missing   2  it provides a way of comparing multimodality from diverse projects such as high occupancy toll lanes or multimodal centers  and  3  it can help decision makers quantify how multimodality has changed over time  for example  application of the indicator to six u s  public private partnership projects in colorado  florida  rhode island  and virginia showed that the degree of multimodality increased by an average value of 57    while the manner in which the impact boundary is defined affects this calculation for specific projects  the average value remained relatively stable whether the impact boundary was equal to the average commute trip length  or less than half that amount   given that some planners view multimodality as societally beneficial  the indicator proposed herein can help one evaluate the multimodal potential of proposed transportation investments   c  2017 elsevier ltd  all rights reserved

 a robust approach to airport gate assignment with a solution dependent uncertainty budget airport gate assignment  aga  is a critical issue for airport operations management  it aims to assign flights to gates according to their arrival and departure times  to tackle flight delays in airports  we propose a robust airport gate assignment  raga  to minimize the  1   alpha  quantile of the total real time overlap between consecutive flights at the same gate  namely  the total gate blockage time  so that the realized total gate blockage time is worse than its quantile with a probability  at most a  given any constant  we develop an asymptotically tight upper bound for the violation probability that total gate blockage time is worse than the constant  based on the upper bound  a solution dependent uncertainty budget is introduced to develop a robust counterpart  rcp  for the raga  we further develop a solution technique for the rcp by transforming the problem into a finite number of tractable binary programmings  an empirical study of the shuangliu international airport  ctu  indicates that our proposed robust approach for aga outperforms existing methods   c  2017 elsevier ltd  all rights reserved  
 a route choice model with context dependent value of time this paper proposes a route choice model that incorporates the various behavioral mechanisms in route choice proposed in the literature including the shortest path  bounded rationality  asymmetric preference  and the time surplus maximization  in the proposed model  travelers are assumed to compare travel cost to their status quo  travel cost of the currently used path  in deciding whether to switch to another alternative  and the underlying value of time is adaptive in the sense that it varies across different route choice contexts  we find that the status quo dependent route choice model can handle the route choice inertia resulting from different sources  e g   travelers  misperceptions  satisficing behavior  asymmetric preference   moreover  the inertia is path specific and can incorporate the scaling effect of travel cost on travelers  route choices  examples are provided to illustrate the proposed status quo dependent route choice model as well as its connection with various existing route choice models

 a simulator based analysis of engineering treatments for right hook bicycle crashes at signalized intersections a right hook crash is a crash between a right turning motor vehicle and an adjacent through moving bicycle  at signalized intersections  these crashes can occur during any portion of the green interval when conflicting bicycles and vehicles are moving concurrently  the objective of this research was to evaluate the effectiveness of four types of engineering countermeasures   regulatory signage  intersection pavement marking  smaller curb radius  and protected intersection design   at modifying driver behaviors that are known contributing factors in these crashes  this research focused on right hook crashes that occur during the latter stage of the circular green indication at signalized intersections with a shared right turn and through lane  changes in driver performance in response to treatments were measured in a high fidelity driving simulator  twenty eight participants each completed 22 right turn maneuvers  a partially counterbalanced experimental design exposed drivers to critical scenarios  which had been determined in a previous experiment  for each turn  driver performance measures  including visual attention  crash avoidance  and potential crash severity  were collected  a total of 75 incidents  47 near collisions and 28 collisions  were observed during the 616 right turns  all treatments had some positive effect on measured driver performance with respect to the right turn vehicle conflicts  further work is required to map the magnitude of these changes in driver performance to crash based outcomes  
 a stated choice experiment to measure the effect of informational and normative conformity in the preference for electric vehicles this work aims to measure the effect of both informational and normative conformity in the preference for electric vehicles  ev  versus internal combustion vehicles  icv   differently from most of the literature in the field  measures of conformity are included as attributes inside a stated choice  sc  experiment  allowing a direct comparison of their effects with typical effects such as purchase price  range and fuel electricity price  to measure informational conformity we set up an experiment where the same individual answers the choice tasks before and after he she has received social information on three specific ev features  range  parking spaces reserved for ev and the need to change activity schedule if using an ev  normative conformity was measured in terms of social adoption  social signalling and injunctive norms  social adoption and a pair of eyes to detect social signalling were included as attributes in the stated choice experiment  while injunctive norms were measured using psychometric indicators  the sc experiment was also aimed at testing the effect of parking policy on the choice of ev  hybrid choice models were estimated and a resampling technique was used to test the model sensitivity to the sample gathered  all social conformity effects tested are highly significant and their impact in the overall utility can be high enough to compensate also quite low driving range for ev  e g  around 130 km  or significant differences in purchase price  for example 1 3 higher for ev than icv   we also found that parking price and the number of slots reserved for ev can be effective in boosting the demand for ev  but a combination of parking policies is needed because each measure alone does not have a sufficient impact to compensate major differences in the characteristics between ev and icv   c  2017 elsevier ltd  all rights reserved  
 a stochastic flow capturing model to optimize the location of fast charging stations with uncertain electric vehicle flows we develop a model to optimize the location of public fast charging stations for electric vehicles  evs   a difficulty in planning the placement of charging stations is uncertainty in where ev charging demands appear  for this reason  we use a stochastic flow capturing location model  sfclm   a sample average approximation method and an averaged two replication procedure are used to solve the problem and estimate the solution quality  we demonstrate the use of the sfclm using a central ohio based case study  we find that most of the stations built are concentrated around the urban core of the region  as the number of stations built increases  some appear on the outskirts of the region to provide an extended charging network  we find that the sets of optimal charging station locations as a function of the number of stations built are approximately nested  we demonstrate the benefits of the charging station network in terms of how many evs are able to complete their daily trips by charging midday six public charging stations allow at least 60  of evs that would otherwise not be able to complete their daily tours without the stations to do so  we finally compare the sfclm to a deterministic model  in which ev flows are set equal to their expected values  we show that if a limited number of charging stations are to be built  the sfclm outperforms the deterministic model  as the number of stations to be built increases  the sfclm and deterministic model select very similar station locations   c  2017 elsevier ltd  all rights reserved  
 a stochastic multi agent optimization model for energy infrastructure planning under uncertainty in an oligopolistic market this paper presents a mathematical model for analyzing long term infrastructure investment decisions in a deregulated electricity market  such as the case in the united states  the interdependence between different decision entities in the system is captured in a network based stochastic multi agent optimization model  where new entrants of investors compete among themselves and with existing generators for natural resources  transmission capacities  and demand markets  to overcome computational challenges involved in stochastic multi agent optimization problems  we have developed a solution method by combining stochastic decomposition and variational inequalities  which converts the original problem to many smaller problems that can be solved more easily  
 a stochastic optimal control approach for real time traffic routing considering demand uncertainties and travelers  choice heterogeneity this paper develops a theoretical approach to identify optimal traffic routing strategy for managing transportation systems  it obtains the optimal traffic diversion ratio to each route that can be achieved in real time through cutting edge sensing and vehicle infrastructure communication technologies  we minimize the expected total travel time of all travelers in the network by providing and updating routing advice  or incentives  to travelers in real time  the system optimum traffic routing problem is modeled using the stochastic control approach where demand uncertainty and travelers  heterogeneity are explicitly considered over time  the approach is generic in the sense that the optimal routing strategies can be achieved through various technologies  such as connected vehicle technologies  navigation systems  variable message signs  dynamic pricing  etc  for a two route representative network  we use dynamic programming to derive and approximate the analytical solution of the optimal routing policy for each time interval  the optimal diversion ratio can be updated solely upon the traffic counts measured along the preferred route in real time  the general rule is  with a high probability  to minimize the congestion and keep the maximum flow performance on the preferred route from the beginning of the peak hours  towards the end of the peak hours  the optimal policy would allow more intensive use of the preferred route resulting over saturation  whereas keeping the minimal use of the alternative route  the analytical solution is validated and examined in a synthesized network and a real world network in california  it is found that it consistently outperforms the deterministic solution  and its resultant system performance is also reasonably close to the benchmark system optimum where true demand could be precisely known one day ahead   c  2017 elsevier ltd  all rights reserved  
 a stochastic program approach for path reconstruction oriented sensor location model path flow identification is of particular interest for a number of traffic applications  such as od demand estimation  link flow inference  and toll freeway revenue management  optimal positioning of active sensors can help to identify path flows  due to the stochastic nature of transportation systems  we propose a scenario based two stage stochastic programming framework which considers the uncertainty of the link path matrix  the first stage model aims to minimize the total traffic sensor installation cost and the expected penalty for uncovered and undifferentiated paths  the second stage model attempts to minimize uncovered and undifferentiated paths for a given sensor location pattern and a specific scenario  in addition  a mean risk measure is also incorporated into the two stage stochastic programming framework  and consequently a mean risk two stage stochastic programming model is proposed  both models have the same structure  where the first stage and second stage decision variables are binary  the second stage decision variable can be relaxed to a continuous variable without changing the nature of the model  to solve the two stochastic programming models  a branch and bound based integer l shaped algorithm is presented  finite steps convergence is guaranteed for the algorithm  to handle the problem with a large number of scenarios  a sampling technique is introduced  and the confidence bound is analyzed with respect to the scenario size  extensive numerical experiments are conducted to verify the effectiveness of the proposed models and algorithm  the most important numerical results are as follows   i  the stochastic programming framework is capable of capturing the reality more efficiently and accurately   ii  the path differentiation factor is more critical than the path coverage factor in determining the sensor placement pattern  and  iii  in the partial parameter setting case  the mean risk based stochastic programming model results in a significantly different sensor placement pattern compared to the normal stochastic programming model  the study contributes to practical sensor placement design   c  2017 elsevier ltd  all rights reserved  
 a structural vector autoregressive model of technical efficiency and delays with an application to chinese airlines this study reports on the performance assessment of chinese airlines from 2006 to 2014 using a stochastic distance function where technical efficiency and a measure of flight delays follow a joint structural autoregressive process  this model is used to investigate whether technical efficiency causes flight punctuality or the other way around  the model  however  yields a non trivial likelihood function and is not amenable to estimation using least squares or standard maximum likelihood techniques  to estimate the model therefore  we propose and implement maximum simulated likelihood with importance sampling  the results suggest a mutual dependence  feedback  between technical efficiency and delays  policy implications are derived   c  2017 elsevier ltd  all rights reserved  
 a study investigating the comparative situation awareness of older and younger drivers when driving a route with extended periods of cognitive taxation this study sought to measure and compare the situation awareness  sa  of a younger group of 11 drivers  average age 28 2 years  to that of an older group of 10 drivers  average age 77 2 years   as they traversed a route that included many cognitively taxing elements  this was achieved by recording a participant s continual commentary of what s he felt to be of relevance during the drive  these recordings were then transcribed and assessed by computer software capable of abstracting the main concepts from each individual s or group s narrative  and calculating scores indicative of situation awareness  it was found that the younger drivers scored significantly higher  p   0 024  than their older counterparts  furthermore  when the results from the participants who undertook both this and previous studies in the series were compared  see key  morris    mansfield  2016   it was found that sa scoring could be importantly influenced by perceptions of a task s difficulty  rather than its actual difficulty  it was also indicative from the narratives  that the younger driving group had demonstrated a better 360 degree awareness  and enunciated more safety related concepts   c  2017 elsevier ltd  all rights reserved  
 a study of pedestrian group behaviors in crowd evacuation based on an extended floor field cellular automaton model in the study of pedestrian movements  a consideration of group behaviors is important because of their potential impacts on pedestrian flow dynamics  in this paper  we investigate the group behaviors during emergency evacuation  which is a critical case for emergency crowd management but has not been fully explored and understood  it has been well recognized that in evacuation situations  some people within a crowd  especially those who are with families and friends  often move in small groups and act in particular patterns distinct from individuals  as a result  the crowd is a mixture of individuals and groups rather than a pure collection of individuals  to capture and evaluate the influence of group behaviors on crowd evacuation  we propose an extended floor field cellular automaton  ca  model that takes into account such phenomena  our model is formulated by leveraging the leader follower behavior rule that is evident in pedestrian group behaviors  to calibrate and validate the proposed model  a few field experiments of crowd evacuation were conducted in a university building  through a representative case study  it is demonstrated that the proposed extended floor field ca model can replicate the well known phenomena in crowd evacuation such as collective arch like clogging at the exit as well as other commonly observed group behaviors in evacuation  moreover  it is found that the total crowd evacuation time significantly increases with the presence of pedestrian groups in the crowd  the results also show that such negative effects of group behaviors in crowd evacuation intensify when the density of the crowd is higher  subsequently  sensitivity analyses are performed to further explore how pedestrian group behaviors are influenced by model parameters that reflect the pedestrian flow dynamics in evacuation scenarios  with its capability of realistically replicating the field pedestrian evacuation  the proposed model can serve as a valuable tool for predicting crowd evacuation time and designing guidelines for pedestrian evacuation in emergency situations  in particular when group behaviors are salient   c  2016 elsevier ltd  all rights reserved

 a time space network flow approach to dynamic repositioning in bicycle sharing systems faced with increasing population density  rising traffic congestion  and the resulting upsurge in carbon emissions  several urban metropolitan areas have instituted public bicycle sharing system as a viable alternative mode of transportation to complement existing long distance bus  and metro transit systems  a pressing issue that needs to be addressed in bike sharing systems is the accrued imbalance of bicycles between commuter demands and inventory levels at stations  to overcome this issue  a commonly employed strategy is to reposition bicycles during off peak periods  typically at night  when no new user arrivals are expected  however  when such an imbalance occurs during day time peak hours  such a passive strategy would result in lower resource utilization rates  to overcome this drawback  in this study  we propose a dynamic bicycle repositioning methodology that considers inventory level forecasting  user arrivals forecasting  bicycle repositioning  and vehicle routing in a unified manner  a multi commodity time space network flow model is presented  which results in an underlying complex nonlinear optimization problem  this problem is then reformulated into an equivalent mixed integer problem using a model transformation approach and a novel heuristic algorithm is proposed to efficiently solve this model  specifically  the first stage involves solving the linear relaxation of the mip model  and a set covering problem is subsequently solved in the second stage to assign routes to the repositioning vehicles  the proposed methodology is evaluated using standard test bed instances from the literature  and our numerical results reveal that the heuristic algorithm can achieve a significant reduction in rejected user requests when compared to existing methods  while yet expending only minimal computational effort   c  2016 elsevier ltd  all rights reserved

 a two stage approach for estimating a statewide truck trip table this research develops a two stage approach to estimate a statewide truck origin destination  o d  trip table  the proposed approach is supported by two sequential stages  the first estimates the commodity based truck o d trip tables primarily derived from the commodity flow database  and the second refines the o d estimates using the observed truck counts  the first stage uses national commodity flow data from the freight analysis framework version 3  faf 3   database to develop a commodity based truck trip table  while the second stage uses the path flow estimator  pfe  concept to refine the truck trip table obtained from the first stage using the truck counts from the statewide truck count program  the model allows great flexibility for data incorporation at different spatial levels in terms of estimating the statewide truck o d trip table  to show proof of concept  a case study is conducted using the utah statewide freight transportation network to demonstrate how the two stage approach can be implemented in practice  the results show that the proposed approach is applicable for estimating a statewide truck o d trip table with limited resources  and can be used to conduct truck corridor analysis to determine congested links and potential bottlenecks in utah   c  2016 elsevier ltd  all rights reserved  
 a two stage stochastic optimization model for scheduling electric vehicle charging loads to relieve distribution system constraints electric vehicles  evs  hold promise to improve the energy efficiency and environmental impacts of transportation  however  widespread ev use can impose significant stress on electricity distribution systems due to their added charging loads  this paper proposes a centralized ev charging control model  which schedules the charging of evs that have flexibility  this flexibility stems from evs that are parked at the charging station for a longer duration of time than is needed to fully recharge the battery  the model is formulated as a two stage stochastic optimization problem  the model captures the use of distributed energy resources and uncertainties around ev arrival times and charging demands upon arrival  non ev loads on the distribution system  energy prices  and availability of energy from the distributed energy resources  we use a monte carlo based sample average approximation technique and an l shaped method to solve the resulting optimization problem efficiently  we also apply a sequential sampling technique to dynamically determine the optimal size of the randomly sampled scenario tree to give a solution with a desired quality at minimal computational cost  we demonstrate the use of our model on a central ohio based case study  we show the benefits of the model in reducing charging costs  negative impacts on the distribution system  and unserved ev charging demand compared to simpler heuristics  we also conduct sensitivity analyses  to show how the model performs and the resulting costs and load profiles when the design of the station or ev usage parameters are changed   c  2017 elsevier ltd  all rights reserved

 a unified follow the leader model for vehicle  bicycle and pedestrian traffic in this research we performed new bicycle and pedestrian experiments to supplement data extracted from existing follow the leader experiments in vehicles  bicycles and pedestrians  and studied their spacetime trajectories and flow density  or spacing velocity  phase diagrams  the strong similarities in the spacetime trajectories and the bi variate phase plots as well as the relative consistence of the estimated proportionality parameter across all three types of traffic  suggest that a unified behavioral mechanism is at play in human driven traffic  it is suggested that this mechanism is essentially a safety driven behavior that vehicles  bicycles or pedestrians adopt a safe speed for a given spacing between them  this behavior is well described by a well known model in vehicular traffic and it is shown in this paper that a scaled version of this model applies to all three types of traffic  a unified relaxation driven social force traffic model is then proposed to incorporate this behavior mechanism  simulations with the same setup as the real life experiments were carried out for vehicle  bicycle  and pedestrian traffic using the unified traffic model and the simulated spacetime trajectories and fundamental diagrams show remarkable consistence with the experimental results   c  2017 elsevier ltd  all rights reserved

 a value at risk  var  approach to routing rail hazmat shipments hazardous materials  hazmat  accidents are rare though the consequences could be disastrous  given the possibility of low probability   high consequence event  a risk averse routing hazmat shipment is necessary  we propose a value at risk  var  approach to route rail hazmat shipments  using the best train configuration  over a given railroad network with limited number of train services such that the transport risk as measured by var is minimized  freight train derailment reports of the federal railroad administration were analyzed to develop expressions that would incorporate characteristics of railroad accidents  and then to estimate the different inputs  the proposed methodology was used to study several problem instances generated using the realistic network of a railroad operator  and to demonstrate that it is possible to develop different routes for shipments depending on the risk preference of the decision maker   c  2017 elsevier ltd  all rights reserved  
 a vibrotactile wristband to help older pedestrians make safer street crossing decisions introduction  older pedestrians are overrepresented in fatal accidents  studies consistently show gap acceptance difficulties  especially in complex traffic situations such as two way streets and when vehicles approached rapidly  in this context  the present research was aimed at assessing the effectiveness of a vibrotactile device and study older pedestrian s behavior when wearing the wristband designed to help them make safer street crossing decisions  method  twenty younger old participants  age 60 69   20 older old participants  age 70 80  and 17 younger adults  age 20 45  carried out a street crossing task in a simulated two way traffic environment with and without a vibrotactile wristband delivering warning messages  results  the percentage of decisions that led to collisions with approaching cars decreased significantly when participants wore the wristband  benefits tended to be greater particularly among very old women  with fewer collisions in the far lane and when vehicles approached rapidly when they wore the wristband  but collisions did not fall to zero  and responses that were in accordance with the wristband advice went up to only 51 6  on average  for all participants  the wristband was nevertheless considered useful and easy to use by all participants  moreover  behavioral intentions to buy and use such a device in the future were greater in both groups of older participants  but not among the younger adults  
 a walk trip generation model for portland  or this study proposes a home based walk trip generation model  based on the built environment around households  controlling for sociodemographic influences  two stage hurdle models are estimated based on a household travel survey in portland  oregon  the first stage predicts the probability of households making any home based walk trips  the second stage predicts the number of home based walk trips for the subset of households that make such trips  the study also tests built environment variables for three different buffer widths around household locations to see which scale best explains walking behavior  the results show that sociodemographic characteristics are strong predictors of walk trip generation  specifically  household size  income  and number of workers in the household influence the probability of a household having any walk trips  while household size and number of children in the household affect the number of walk trips made by the subset of households making walk trips  characteristics of the built environment are also significant  activity density  transit stop density  employment accessibility  intersection density  and most interestingly  sidewalk quality are associated with the decision to walk as a mode of travel  while land use entropy  transit stop density  employment accessibility  sidewalk quality  and traffic calming and signal are predictors of the number of walk trips made by households making walk trips  sidewalk quality is represented by a single principal component that neatly captures the common variance in an array of sidewalk variables  to our knowledge  this is the first walk trip generation model to include a measure of sidewalk quality   c  2017 elsevier ltd  all rights reserved  
 access to the city  mobility patterns  transport and accessibility in peripheral settlements of dar es salaam this paper is concerned with access to the city for urban residents living in the periphery of dar es salaam  tanzania  the paper presents an analysis of the mobility practices of residents and investigates the mobility constraints they experience in relation to the limited accessibility provided by the urban transport system  the paper draws upon qualitative interviews with residents in the periphery as well as recently collected travel speed data and offers a unique combination of testimony with gis based modelling of overall accessibility  a central finding is the overall importance of regular mobility and access to the city for residents in the periphery  regular mobility is an ingrained part of residents  livelihood strategies  the majority of households rely on one or more members regularly travelling to central parts of the city in relation to their livelihood activities  the analysis reveals a widespread  near to universal  dependence on motorized transportation  with the vast majority depending on public transport  raster based modelling of overall accessibility provides an indication of the very high travel times endured by residents in the periphery  the analysis identifies and distinguishes between three overall mode types  1  private car  2  public transport and 3  motorcycle car combined with public transport  while private cars appear marginally faster  differences in travel times are actually limited  this suggests that travel times are less influenced by mode of transport than by road and traffic conditions and highlights how accessibility problems of peripheral settlements are not easily understood separately from the general dysfunctions of the overall mobility system of city  
 accessibility evaluations for nighttime walking and bicycling for low income shift workers this paper addresses an important issue related to nighttime commuting of low income shift workers who walk and or bike to their workplace using public transit  a shift worker is anyone who follows a work schedule that is outside of the typical daytime working hours of a business day and commute after dark by walking or bicycling to a transit stop  however  poor visibility conditions on sidewalks and bicycle lanes often thwart safety of their walking and bicycling activities  therefore  this paper develops two simple scores nighttime accessibility score for walking  nasw  and nighttime accessibility for bicycling  nasb    for evaluating nighttime infrastructure for pedestrians and bicyclist  the scores consider the employment data  travel time and the physical distribution of streetlight poles along the sidewalks and bicycle lanes  data from the city of el paso in texas is used to demonstrate the applicability of the two scores  employment data from three prominent service industry sectors known to employ low income shift workers   i  retail trade  ii  accommodation and food services  and iii  health care and social assistance   are used for demonstration purposes  it is observed that amongst the three sectors analyzed  both nasw and nasb values are higher for regions in el paso with low income employment concentrations from the health care and social assistance sector  it is also observed that some prominent regions in north east  south east and west of el paso need improvements in streetlight systems  sidewalks and bicycle network to facilitate walking and bicycling amongst low income shift workers employed in retail trade  and accommodation and food services industry sectors to access transit stops at night  
 accessibility mapping of health facilities in rural ghana despite collaborative efforts by government  csos and the private sector in the provision of health facilities in ghana  a substantial proportion of communities in rural ghana still have poor accessibility to basic health services  using a mixed approach  this paper presents an overview of geographic accessibility to health care services in wa west district  semi structured interviews were conducted with randomly selected 100 households to ascertain their perception on accessibility to health services  based on the major means of transport to each level of health service  gis was used to model communities accessibility to health facilities  the findings revealed that  three levels of health services chps  health centres and district hospital exist in wa west district  over 50  of communities were found to have high accessibility to chps compounds and health centres because of their widespread distribution  in contrast  only few communities  4   have high physical access to district hospital  poor conditions of roads were a major barrier in household s accessibility to district hospital  the findings therefore underscore the need for an integrated and cross sectoral approach to improve accessibility to health care services  
 accessibility measures for robustness of the transport system accessibility is a key concept in transport and land use policies  and infrastructure based measures are one important category of accessibility measures  recently  there has been a significant increase in the attention paid in both academic literature and policy documents to the robustness of the transport system  however  there is not a mature body of literature on the infrastructure based accessibility measures expressing this concept  this paper proposes a family of accessibility measures to express the robustness of the transport system  these have in common that they express the number of travel options between a given origin and destination  or to conduct activities  the family of measures is conceptualized by using the multi state supernetwork approach  with respect to the travel options  we discuss  1  the overlap of travel routes  and  2  the choices of travel modes  e g  car versus train  multimodal   with respect to the activities  we discuss  1  the choice of od pairs as opposed to activity travel patterns  and  2  fixed versus flexible activity locations and fixed versus flexible order of activities  we illustrate the travel options and robustness in a multi modal transport system between the city centers of the hague rotterdam dordrecht corridor  the netherlands   
 accounting for price endogeneity in airline itinerary choice models  an application to continental us markets network planning models  which forecast the profitability of airline schedules  support many critical decisions  including equipment purchase decisions  network planning models include an itinerary choice model that is used to allocate air total demand in a city pair to different itineraries  multinomial logit  mnl  models are commonly used in practice and capture how individuals make trade offs among different itinerary attributes  however  none that we are aware of account for price endogeneity  this study formulates an itinerary choice model that is consistent with those used by industry and corrects for price endogeneity using a control function that uses several types of instrumental variables  we estimate our model using a database of more than 10 million passenger trips provided by the airlines reporting corporation  results based on continental u s  markets for may 2013 departures show that models that fail to account for price endogeneity overestimate customers  value of time and result in biased price estimates and incorrect pricing recommendations  the size and comprehensiveness of our database allows us to estimate highly refined departure time of day preference curves that account for distance  direction of travel  number of time zones traversed  departure day of week and itinerary type  outbound  inbound or one way   these time of day preference curves can be used by airlines  researchers  and government organizations in the evaluation of different policies such as congestion pricing   c  2017 elsevier ltd  all rights reserved  
 accounting for systematic heterogeneity across car commuters in response to multiple tdm policies  case study of tehran modeling commuters  choice behavior in response to transportation demand management  tdm  helps in predicting the consequences of tdm policies  although research looking at choice behavior has evolved to investigate preference heterogeneity in response to factors influencing mode choice  as far as we know  no study has considered taste variation across commuters in response to multiple tdm policies  this paper investigates the presence of systematic preference heterogeneity across commuters  in response to the tdm policies that can be explained by their socio economic or commuting related characteristics  analysis is based on results of a stated preference survey developed using a design of experiments approach  five policies were assessed in order to study the impact they had on how commuters chose their mode of transportation  these include increasing parking cost  increasing fuel cost  implementing cordon pricing  reducing transit time and improving access to transit facilities  for the sake of assessing both systematic and random preference heterogeneity across car commuters  a form of the mixed multinomial logit  mmnl  model that identifies sources of heterogeneity and consequently makes the choice models less restrictive in considering both systematic and random preference variation across individuals was developed  the sample includes 366 individuals who regularly commute to their workplace in the city center of tehran  iran  the likelihood function value of this model shows a significant improvement compared to the base mnl model  using the same variables  the mmnl model shows that taste variation across the studied commuters results in differences in influences estimated for three policies  increasing parking cost  reducing transit time and improving access to transit  the analysis examines several distributions for random parameters to test the impacts of restricting distributions to allow for only normality  the results confirm the potential to improve model fit with alternative distributions  
 achieving energy savings by intelligent transportation systems investments in the context of smart cities investments in intelligent transportation systems  its  are beginning to take place in the context of smart city initiatives in many cities  energy efficiency and emissions reduction are becoming essential rationales for such investments  it is important  therefore  to understand under what conditions investments in its in the context of smart cities produce energy savings  we reviewed existing literature  conducted case studies and interviews  and found that the smart cities context has transformed traditional its into  smart mobility  with three major characteristics  people centric  data driven  and powered by bottom up innovations  we argue that there are four main steps for smart mobility solutions to achieve energy savings and that several institutional  technical  and physical conditions are required at each step  energy savings are achieved when users change their behavior and result in less travel  modal shift  and reduction of per km energy consumption in the short term  smart mobility solutions also enable other energy saving policies or initiatives  which would otherwise not be feasible  in the long term  users  lifestyles could change and lead to further energy savings  for cities in developing countries with lower motorization  less developed infrastructure  less financial resources  and less institutional and technical capacity  our recommendations to achieve benefits from smart mobility investments are   1  involve all public and private players in a collaborative and transparent setting   2  develop the technical capacity to procure and monitor information services  and  3  focus on basic infrastructure  including a coherent road network and basic traffic management measures   c  2017 the world bank  published by elsevier ltd  
 acoustic amenity analysis for high rise building along urban expressway  modeling traffic noise vertical propagation using neural networks traditional noise propagation models are built for particular height of building  residents living in high rise buildings are severely affected by noise  the main objective of this study is to analyze acoustic amenity and develop noise analysis model for high rise buildings  especially those along urban expressway  the study was carried out in three stages  firstly  noise survey on different floors of high rise buildings along free flow expressway was conducted using noise measuring equipment  furthermore  c weighted network was used in conjunction with a weighted network to determine low frequency noise  which is perhaps less noticed for most survey  secondly  the noise indicators change rule on vertical plane was explored  combining change rule with frequency spectrum analysis  the acoustic amenity for high rise buildings was carried out deeply and strictly  in the last stage  traffic noise prediction model for high rise building along expressway was constructed with neural network  a point worth emphasizing is that the comparison between developed model  fhwa model and measurement shows that the proposed model fits well with measurement as compared to fhwa model at 5  significance level  the developed method could be used as a tool for acoustic amenity analysis and model building  it would be possible to provide reference for urban expressway and building design   c  2017 elsevier ltd  all rights reserved  
 adaptation patterns to high speed rail usage in taiwan and china understanding the gradual changes in travel behavior over time is essential to comprehending travelers  adaptation process to new infrastructure  however  capturing cause and effect relationships in long term travel behavior patterns is generally difficult to obtain even with panel data  this paper proposes a different data collection methodology  which aims at analyzing specifically the gradual changes of travel behavior  as a case study we analyze the usage of high speed rail in taiwan and china over the last 8 years  by developing ten graphical long term usage patterns with detailed usage descriptions  the behavioral dynamics of our sample could be captured and to some degree explained  our results indicate that nearly all respondents can identify with one of the pattern  a comparison between stated usage frequency and our patterns illustrates further the additional information we obtain compared to  traditional  surveys  analysis of the causes for usage changes further illustrates some marked differences between reasons for initial usage uptake  among others personality related factors   gradual usage increases  particularly service quality  and usage reductions  such as life events   
 adaptive routing and recharging policies for electric vehicles planning a trip with an electric vehicle requires consideration of both battery dynamics and the availability of charging infrastructure  recharging costs for an electric vehicle  which increase as the battery s charge level increases  are fundamentally different than refueling costs for conventional vehicles  which do not depend on the amount of fuel already in the tank  furthermore  the viability of any route requiring recharging is sensitive to the availability of charging stations along the way  in this paper  we study the problem of finding an optimal adaptive routing and recharging policy for an electric vehicle in a network  each node in the network represents a charging station and has an associated probability of being available at any point in time or occupied by another vehicle  we develop efficient algorithms for finding an optimal a priori routing and recharging policy and then present solution approaches to an adaptive problem that build on a priori policy  we present two heuristic methods for finding adaptive policies one with adaptive recharging decisions only and another with both adaptive routing and recharging decisions  we then further enhance our solution approaches to a special case of the grid network  we conduct numerical experiments to demonstrate the empirical performance of our solutions and provide insights to our findings

 adolescent school travel  is online mapping a practical alternative to gps assessed travel routes  background  geographically accurate travel routes are necessary to estimate exposure to the environment and its potential influence on travel behaviour  although assessing travel behaviours with global positioning system  gps  receivers is increasingly common  these protocols place noticeable burden on participants and processing these data is time consuming and error prone  interactive online mapping surveys allow users to draw their own travel routes  and may offer a time and cost effective alternative  however  these routes are still self reported  and their true accuracy remains unknown  methods  a total of 196 adolescents drew their usual route to school within an online mapping survey and wore a gps receiver for 7 days  individual home to school routes were extracted from gps data  generalized linear mixed models were used to assess differences in distance and spatial agreement between routes  and how these varied by mode of travel and other route characteristics  results  gps assessed routes were longer than the routes participants drew across all travel modes  routes travelled actively displayed 12 32  higher agreement compared to those travelled passively  p   0 01   taking multiple routes to school  29 9  of participants  reduced the agreement by 10 76   p   0 01   every additional travel mode transition  e g   during multimodal trips  was associated with 2 20  lower agreement  p   0 01   in total  40 7  of participants used more than one travel mode to school over the assessment period  conclusions  online mapping surveys are a feasible method for route assessment in adolescents  particularly for active travel routes  with the integration of survey questions  there is considerable potential for understanding the intricacies of travel behaviours  however  the self reporting error seems more pronounced for longer routes  and when multiple travel modes are used  researchers should consider the advantages  e g   ease of collection  and disadvantages  e g   lack of temporal information  when deciding if the data obtainable are sufficient to answer their research questions   c  2016 elsevier ltd all rights reserved  
 adoption of alternative fuel vehicles  influence from neighbors  family and coworkers during the last years  many governments have set targets for increasing the share of bio fuels in the transportation sector  understanding consumer behavior is essential in designing policies that efficiently increase the uptake of cleaner technologies  in this paper we analyze adopters and non adopters of alternative fuel vehicles  afvs   we use diffusion of innovation theory and the established notion that the social system and interpersonal influence play important roles in adoption  based on a nationwide database of car owners we analyze interpersonal influence on adoption from three social domains  neighbors  family and coworkers  the results point primarily at a neighbor effect in that afv adoption is more likely if neighbors also have adopted  the results also point at significant effects of interpersonal influence from coworkers and family members but these effects weaken or disappear when income  education level  marriage  age  gender and green party votes are controlled for  the results extend the diffusion of innovation and afv literature with empirical support for interpersonal influence based on objective data where response bias is not a factor  implications for further research  environmental and transport policy  and practitioners are discussed   c  2017 the authors  published by elsevier ltd  
 age differences in the takeover of vehicle control and engagement in non driving related activities in simulated driving with conditional automation high level vehicle automation has been proposed as a valuable means to enhance the mobility of older drivers  as older drivers experience age related declines in many cognitive functions that are vital for safe driving  recent research attempted to examine age differences in how engagement in non driving related activities impact driving performance  by instructing drivers to engage in mandatory pre designed activities  while the mandatory engagement method allows a precise control of the timing and mental workload of the non driving related activities  it is different from how a driver would naturally engage in these activities  this study allowed younger  age 18 35  mean age  19 9 years  and older drivers  age 62 81  mean age   70 4years  to freely decide when and how to engage in voluntarily chosen non driving related activities during simulated driving with conditional automation  we coded video recordings of participants  engagement in non driving related activities  we examined the effect of age  level of activity engagement and takeover notification interval on vehicle control performance during the takeover  by comparing between the high and low engagement groups in younger and older drivers  across two takeover notification interval conditions  we found that both younger and older drivers engaged in various non driving related activities during the automated driving portion  with distinct preferences on the type of activity for each age group  i e   while younger drivers mostly used an electronic device  older drivers tended to converse   there were also significant differences between the two age groups and between the two notification intervals on various driving performance measures  older drivers benefited more than younger drivers from the longer interval in terms of response time to notifications  voluntary engagement in non driving related activities did not impair takeover performance in general  although there was a trend of older drivers who were more engaged in non driving related activities braking harder than those with low activity engagement during the takeover  published by elsevier ltd  
 age  gender and deterrability  are younger male drivers more likely to discount the future  utilizing the classical deterrence theory and stafford and warr s  1993  reconceptualized model of deterrence  the current study examined whether age  gender  and discounting the future tendencies influence perceptions of being apprehended for speeding offences  licensed motorists  n   700  57  female  in queensland  australia  were recruited to complete a self report questionnaire that measured perceptual deterrence  speeding related behaviors and discounting the future tendencies  data were analyzed utilizing descriptive  bivariate and multivariate regressions  significant  albeit weak  positive correlations were found between age and perceptions of apprehension certainty  males were significantly more likely to report higher incidences of speeding  including while avoiding detection  compared to females  in contrast  females were more likely to perceive high levels of apprehension certainty and consider impending penalties to be more severe  at a multivariate level  discounting the future tendencies  in addition to being male  reporting lower levels of perceptual severity and swiftness  and more instances of punishment avoidance  were predictive of lower perceptual certainty levels  this study is one of the first to reveal that being male and having a tendency to discount the consequences of the future may directly influence drivers  perceptual deterrence levels  
 aggression  emotional self regulation  attentional bias  and cognitive inhibition predict risky driving behavior the present study explored whether aggression  emotional regulation  cognitive inhibition  and attentional bias towards emotional stimuli were related to risky driving behavior  driving errors  and driving violations   a total of 117 applicants for taxi driver positions  89  male  m age   36 59 years  sd   9 39  age range 24 62 years  participated in the study  measures included the ahwaz aggression inventory  the difficulties in emotion regulation questionnaire  the emotional stroop task  the go no go task  and the driving behavior questionnaire  correlation and regression analyses showed that aggression and emotional regulation predicted risky driving behavior  difficulties in emotion regulation  the obstinacy and revengeful component of aggression  attentional bias toward emotional stimuli  and cognitive inhibition predicted driving errors  aggression was the only significant predictive factor for driving violations  in conclusion  aggression and difficulties in regulating emotions may exacerbate risky driving behaviors  deficits in cognitive inhibition and attentional bias toward negative emotional stimuli can increase driving errors  predisposition to aggression has strong effect on making one vulnerable to violation of traffic rules and crashes  
 air and high speed rail transport integration on profits and welfare  effects of air rail connecting time air rail integration has become a popular idea to relieve airport congestion and environmental impact of transport industry  especially amid the fast expansion of high speed rail network around the world  this study examines the circumstances under which air rail integration can be better justified  by focusing on the effects of reducing air rail connecting time on transport operators  profits  consumer surplus  and social welfare  we show that while consumers always benefit from less air rail connecting time  an integrated hub with seamless transfer between air and rail services is always preferred by passengers   operators of the two modes  air transport and high speed rail  won t have an incentive to integrate unless the cost of integration is sufficiently low  nonetheless  reducing air rail connecting time enhances total surplus when the hub airport suffers from a certain degree of capacity constraint and the cost of air rail integration is not too high   c  2017 elsevier ltd  all rights reserved  
 air and hst multimodal products  a segmentation analysis for policy makers different solutions for the integration of high speed rail  hsr  and air transport could be implemented  ranging from very basic integration to more sophisticated systems that include ticket and handling integration  this paper uses two statistical techniques  name cluster analysis and discrete choice models in order to investigate how different market segments have a determining influence in being more proactive to change to hsr for the second leg in multimodal trips  a discrete choice experiment is conducted to better understand passengers  preferences  we obtain a number of clusters and estimate flexible choice models  taking into account the panel nature of stated preference data  we obtain a range of willingness to pay values for service quality attributes  finding results that can be used to infer policy conclusions about the real attractiveness of the air hsr integrated alternative  in this respect  clusters and schedule coordination  which reduces connecting time  are crucial to explain hsr attractiveness  
 air cargo revenue management under buy back policy few researches address the application of financial  buy back  concept in the air cargo revenue management  this paper examines the air cargo booking and execution procedure to measure the applicability of the buy back policy in the air cargo revenue  by applying buy back policy during the period of order release and order execution  a revenue model is built which incorporates hellermann s capacity option model into the black scholes pricing model  the results demonstrated that buy back policy not only answers the questions of whether to buy back  when to buy back and how much to buy back  but also increases the revenues of both asset provider and intermediary  further study is extended in the overbooking and partial buy back scenarios  the buy back policy showed better performance in these two scenarios compared with current approach   c  2016 elsevier ltd  all rights reserved

 air traffic flow management under uncertainty using chance constrained optimization in order to efficiently balance traffic demand and capacity  optimization of air traffic flow management  atfm  relies on accurate predictions of future capacity states  however  these predictions are inherently uncertain due to factors  such as weather  this paper presents a novel computationally efficient algorithm to address uncertainty in atfm by using a chance constrained optimization method  first  a chance constrained model is developed based on a previous deterministic integer programming optimization model of atfm to include probabilistic sector capacity constraints  then  to efficiently solve such a large scale chance constrained optimization problem  a polynomial approximation based approach is applied  the approximation is based on the numerical properties of the bernstein polynomial  which is capable of effectively controlling the approximation error for both the function value and gradient  thus  a first order algorithm is adopted to obtain a satisfactory solution  which is expected to be optimal  numerical results are reported in order to evaluate the polynomial approximation based approach by comparing it with the brute force method  moreover  since there are massive independent approximation processes in the polynomial approximation based approach  a distributed computing framework is designed to carry out the computation for this method  this chance constrained optimization method and its computation platform are potentially helpful in their application to several other domains in air transportation  such as airport surface operations and airline management under uncertainties   c  2017 elsevier ltd  all rights reserved  
 air transport services in regional australia  demand pattern  frequency choice and airport entry in this study  we investigate the development of the aviation market at australia s top 50 regional airports during the 2005 2013 period  our demand estimation results suggest that a higher commodity price increases the traffic volume in markets where the local economy is heavily reliant on mineral resources and that appreciation of the australian dollar decreases the passenger flow in tourism dependent areas  the presence of leading airlines and low cost carriers and the availability of international services all contribute positively to market growth  airport entry analysis reveals that the major carriers engage in clear strategic interactions  the qantas airline group uses jetstar as a fighting brand  such that jetstar flies to a destination if and only if the regional airport is also served by virgin australia  the group s major competitor  unlike the routes connected to major airports  the demand at regional airports is not sensitive to flight frequency  our empirical results support the introduction of a consistent aviation policy across australia  especially for issues related to airline competition and demand stimulation  however  special consideration needs to be paid to regional airports to help them deal with economic shocks and cover fixed costs   c  2017 elsevier ltd  all rights reserved  
 air travel for private purposes  an analysis of airport access  income and environmental concern in switzerland as air travel is considered a relevant area of action to mitigate climate change  it is important to know its determinants  the present study examines socio demographic  spatial and attitudinal predictors of air travel for private purposes  the analyses are based on the swiss environmental survey 2007 and a subsequent computation of the respondents  environmental impact  as well as spatial data  a lognormal hurdle model indicates that persons with higher environmental concern are less likely to travel by air and if they still do  they travel less  while political orientations do not affect whether a person travels by air  the results indicate that among those who do fly  respondents voting for the green party cause lower emissions than those opting for other left or center parties  furthermore  higher incomes are associated with more air travel whereas living with children is associated with less air travel  airport access is related to air travel in the sense that living closer to airports  in particular to large ones  is correlated to more air travel  the result is robust to alterations of the accessibility measure and also upholds when population density is controlled for  
 air rail cooperation  partnership level  market structure and welfare implications we build a theoretical model to study different air rail cooperation scenarios  we investigate two possible air rail partnerships between a rail operator and either a domestic airline or a foreign airline  when a partnership is formed  an investment to improve the air rail connecting service is allowed at a cost before the service is launched  we find that the cooperation level  the equilibrium partnership scenarios when air rail cooperation is exclusive or non exclusive  as well as the comparisons of social welfare under different partnership scenarios  all depend on the pre investment quality of air rail service compared with the quality of air air service  we further apply our model to the real life case of strasbourg paris dubai market  showing that other factors  such as price sensitivity of demand  horizontal differentiation between air and rail  and asymmetries in partnership investment costs  also affect cooperation level   c  2017 elsevier ltd  all rights reserved  
 airline baggage fees and flight delays  a floor wax and dessert topping  we examine the linkages between the implementation of baggage fees and late flights in the airline industry  we find that baggage fees policies result in improvements in on time performance as assessed through late flights  directly through improvements in airport side sorting and loading efficiencies  and indirectly through lower air travel demand  we further find that these relationships are contingent upon the presence of a hub airport on a route  our findings have important managerial and public policy implications as baggage fees have often been cited as a driver of security queue  aircraft alley  and overhead bin congestions  and ultimately delayed flights  our results suggest that these suppositions could be misplaced   c  2017 elsevier ltd  all rights reserved  
 airline delay management problem with airport capacity constraints and priority decisions this paper deals with the airline delay management problem  admp   which can be described as the task of dealing with daily airline operational delays and deciding whether to delay subsequent flights at a hub airport or to have them departing on time  an innovative integer linear programming approach is presented to the capacitated case of the admp and airport limitations in terms of bay availability  taxiway capacity and runway separation are incorporated to represent capacity constraints  fuel cost  passenger compensation  and passenger inconvenience costs are included in the objective function  the decision variables include the re timing of flight departures and arrivals  the use of the airport capacity over time and the rebooking of passengers in case of missed connections  to guarantee the linearity of the optimization model and fast computational times  a receding horizon modeling framework is adopted  the approach is applied to a case study using real operational and passenger data from an international hub and spoke carrier  the case study shows the capability of the linear model to deal with a complete day of operations within a few minutes  the results suggest that the proposed approach can lead to cost reductions of almost 30  during recovery  when compared with the solution from the airline  in addition  a sensitivity analysis is provided to investigate the impact of not including passenger inconvenience costs and of reducing runway capacity   c  2017 elsevier ltd  all rights reserved  
 airline efficiency measures using a dynamic epsilon based measure model in this paper  we focus on measuring airline dynamic efficiency  number of employees and aviation kerosene are chosen as the inputs  revenue tonne kilometers  revenue passenger kilometers and total revenue are the outputs  capital stock is selected as the dynamic factor  a new model  dynamic epsilon based measure  debm  model  is proposed to evaluate the dynamic efficiencies of 19 airlines from 2009 to 2014  the main findings are  i  scandinavian  emirates and cathay pacific are the benchmarking airlines among the 19 airlines  2  the highest efficiency change index happens in 2010  which has close relationships with the financial crisis of 2008  3  the output oriented debm and non oriented debm do well in reflecting the efficiency differences  while the input oriented debm and output oriented debm have good performance in mirroring yearly efficiency change   c  2017 elsevier ltd  all rights reserved  
 airline fuel usage and carbon emissions  determining factors using annual data on individual us airlines over the 1995 2015 period  this paper presents regression results relating an airline s total fuel usage to seven variables  the available ton miles of capacity  passengers plus freight and mail  provided by the airline  the average seat capacity of its aircraft  average stage length  flight distance   average load factor  measured by weight   the average vintage  construction year  of its aircraft  the percentage of the airline s flights that are delayed  and the average annual fuel price  the results show how fuel usage and carbon emissions depend on a small set of crucial variables  the estimated fuel price effect allows the emissions impact of an optimal emissions charge to be computed  and the estimated delay effect shows the emissions impact of an industry wide reduction in flight delays  the regression model is generated from a theoretical framework   c  2017 elsevier ltd  all rights reserved  
 airline type and tourist expenditure  are full service and low cost carriers converging or diverging  since some years ago low cost carriers  lccs  are becoming less and less low cost like  as well as full service airlines are becoming less and less full service like  thus contributing to lessen the differences between users of one airline type and the other  lccs have made air travel available to all budgets and enabled tourists to spend more at destination by reallocating their trip expenditure  the objective of this article is to observe if airline types have been converging regarding travellers  expenditure allocation and total trip expenditure  we use repeated cross sections of the spanish tourist expenditure survey between 2006 and 2014  and compositional data analysis with a total in order not to confound effects involving expenditure allocation with those involving expenditure volume  results show that users of both airline types converge in their allocation of the trip budget  between transportation and at destination expenses  and within at destination expenses   but diverge with regard to total trip expenditure   c  2017 elsevier ltd  all rights reserved  
 airport dominance and airline pricing power  an investigation of hub premiums in the chinese domestic market this research analyses the effects of airport dominance on airline pricing power with the empirical study based on the chinese domestic market using fixed effect panel data models  results from the regression analysis indicate that airport dominance is the most important source of pricing power in the gradually deregulated chinese domestic market  hub carriers are able to charge higher prices to premium class passengers and non hub carriers benefit from the  umbrella effects  of hub premiums  however  hub carriers are not able to translate their airport dominance to pricing power in the economy class market  whereas non hub carriers even have to reduce the prices as their market shares at major airports increase  this study contributes to the literature by explicitly segmenting the market into economy and premium classes  the results have important policy implications in terms of further deregulation of chinese domestic market   c  2017 elsevier ltd  all rights reserved  
 airport emissions reductions from reduced thrust takeoff operations given forecast aviation growth  many airports are predicted to reach capacity and require expansion  however  pressure to meet air quality regulations emphasises the importance of efficient ground level aircraft activities to facilitate growth  operational strategies such as reducing engine thrust setting at takeoff can reduce fuel consumption and pollutant emissions  however  quantification of the benefits and consistency of its use have been limited by data restrictions  using 3336 high resolution flight data records  this paper analyses the impact of reduced thrust takeoff at london heathrow  results indicate that using reduced thrust takeoff reduces fuel consumption  nitrogen oxides  nox  and black carbon  bc  emissions by 1 0 23 2   10 7 47 7   and 49 0 71 7  respectively  depending on aircraft engine combinations relative to 100  thrust takeoff  variability in thrust settings for the same aircraft engine combination and dependence on takeoff weight  tow  is quantified  consequently  aircraft engine specific optimum takeoff thrust settings that minimise fuel consumption and pollutant emissions for different aircraft tows are presented  further reductions of 1 9   5 8  and 6 5  for fuel consumption  nox and bc emissions could be achieved  equating to reductions of approximately 0 4   3 5  and 3 3  in total ground level fuel consumption  nox and bc emissions  these results quantify the contribution that reduced thrust operations offer towards achieving industry environmental targets and air quality compliance  and imply that the current implementation of reduced thrust takeoff at heathrow is near optimal  considering operational and safety constraints   c  2017 the authors  published by elsevier ltd  
 airport privatization with public finances under stress  an analysis of government and investor s motivations the management model of airports has long stood as a central research area in the transport sector  there are a wide range of studies that focus on the potential benefits and pitfalls of private airport management  the results of these efficiency studies have not provided irrefutable evidence for the superiority of private management over public management  but the momentum towards privatizing airports is growing  the reason for privatization has been more related with privatization revenues for governments  rather than more efficient management  the search for maximizing the sale value can have negative impacts from a welfare perspective  for example  through excessive increases in tariffs for passengers  this research reflects on the motivations for governments to privatize  and is illustrated by a case study   portugal   in which the privatization occurred as a result of three main large drivers  1  a bailout programme by the imf  the eu  and the ecb  2  a revision of the regulatory model  and  3  the need to increase the capacity of lisbon s airport system in the medium term   c  2017 elsevier ltd  all rights reserved  
 airport  airline and departure time choice and substitution patterns  an empirical analysis this paper uses the random coefficients logit methodology that controls for potential endogeneity of prices and allows for general substitution patterns to estimate various demand systems  the estimation takes advantage of an original ticket level revealed preference data set on travels from the new york city area to toronto that contains prices and characteristics of not only flight choices but also of all non booked alternative flights  consistent with having higher valuations  our results show that travelers buying closer to departure have a higher utility of flying  moreover  consumers  heterogeneity decreases as the flight date nears  at the carrier level  we identify which carriers have more price sensitive consumers and which carriers face greater competition  in addition  the results suggest that our multi airport metropolitan area can be considered as a single market and that jfk and newark are relatively closer substitutes  overall  consumers are more willing to switch to alternative carriers than between airports or departure times   c  2017 elsevier ltd  all rights reserved  
 alcohol consumption and cycling in contrast to driving in germany  the legal blood alcohol limit for cyclists is much higher  0 16 percent  than the limit for drivers  0 05 percent  as long as no crash has occurred  the proportion of police recorded crashes with personal damage under the influence is higher for cyclists than drivers  and the blood alcohol concentrations are higher for cyclists than drivers  63 women and 204 men who drive a car and use a bike and drink alcohol participated in the online study  in the sample  cycling under the influence  cui  was more frequent and was observed more frequently among friends than driving under the influence  dui   persons who use a particular vehicle type more often in general and when they visit friends also use it more often after alcohol consumption  persons who drink alcohol more often cycle more often after alcohol consumption  in all aspects covered  drink cycling was seen as more acceptable and less dangerous than drink driving  persons who cycle more often under the influence observe drink cycling more often among their friends  they think they are less of a danger to themselves and others when cycling after alcohol consumption  and they agree less with the statement that one should leave one s bike parked after alcohol consumption  the attitudes that drinking is unsafe for one s own driving and that one should leave one s car parked are important predictors of  non  drink driving  for cycling  the most important predictors are bike use frequency and observing drink cycling among friends   c  2017 elsevier ltd  all rights reserved  
 alternate weibit based model for assessing green transport systems with combined mode and route travel choices reduction of vehicle emissions is a major component of sustainable transportation development  the promotion of green transport modes is a worthwhile and sustainable approach to change transport mode shares and to contribute to healthier travel choices  in this paper  we provide an alternate weibit based model for the combined modal split and traffic assignment  cmsta  problem that explicitly considers both similarities and  heterogeneous perception variances under congestion  instead of using the widely adopted gumbel distribution  both mode and route choice decisions are derived from random utility theory using the weibull distributed random errors  at the mode choice level  a nested weibit  nw  model is developed to relax the identical perception variance of the logit model  at the route choice level  the recently developed path size weibit  psw  is adopted to handle both route overlapping and route specific perception variance  further  an equivalent mathematical programming  mp  formulation is developed for this nw psw model as a cmsta problem under congested networks  some properties of the proposed models are also rigorously proved  using this alternate weibit based nw psw model  different go green strategies are quantitatively evaluated to examine  a  the behavioral modeling of travelers  mode shift between the private motorized mode and go green modes and  b  travelers  route choice with consideration of both non identical perception variance and route overlapping  the results reveal that mode shares and route choices from the nw psw model can better reflect the changes in model parameters and in network characteristics than the traditional logit and extended logit models   c  2017 published by elsevier ltd  
 alternative fuel for sustainable shipping across the taiwan strait we conducted a total fuel life cycle inventory for atmospheric emissions for two ships operating between mainland china and taiwan  comparing the difference that may result from operating on heavy fuel oil  hfo  and on liquefied natural gas  lng  as fuels  in addition  we assess the global warming impact from these two fueling alternatives  we use a commercially available life cycle assessment  lca  software to conduct a life cycle inventory of airborne emissions from the ship fuel use  our findings indicate possible improvement in total fuel life cycle ghg emissions from the use of lng as alternative fuel to power ships  while total ghg and co2 emission reduced  however  methane emissions increased significantly when lng is used as alternative fuel to power both of our case ships  both ships exhibit great reduction in the emissions of nox  38 39   and co  42 43    the reduction is much more remarkable in so2  99 8   and pm10  97 5    the weight of emissions from operation stage has become relatively smaller in the whole fuel life cycle total ghg emissions  when the two ships move to operate on lng   c  2017 elsevier ltd  all rights reserved  
 alternative fuel vehicle adoption in service fleets  impact evaluation through optimization modeling this paper introduces a new rich vehicle routing problem faced by companies that consider alternative fuel vehicle  afv  adoption into a service fleet consisting of gasoline or diesel vehicles  the service operation addressed here differs from delivery operations in that a vehicle has to stop for extended periods of time while its driver serves customers  we discuss measuring the impact of afv adoption on fleet operations from multiple perspectives and formulate four objective functions to represent the defined performance metrics in a generalized mixed integer linear programming model  the model can accommodate various afv types with respect to driving range  refueling time  and availability of refueling stations  we develop a variable neighborhood search heuristic to solve large scale problems efficiently  results from the research show that the classical vehicle routing objective of minimizing total vehicle miles traveled does not work well in this emerging problem  instead  an objective such as minimizing carbon emissions or fuel costs provides more desirable solutions  the results also show that in service fleets  refueling time has lesser impact on fleet performance compared to service station availability or vehicle range  from a managerial standpoint  this indicates that investment in range extension or establishing service stations is more important than investment in faster refueling capability  
 an activity based and dynamic approach to calculate road traffic noise damages in this paper  an activity based and dynamic approach is presented to analyze population exposures to road traffic noise  the contribution of this innovative approach is that  1  affected people at the workplace and places of education are incorporated and  2  the within day dynamics of varying population densities in different areas of the city is explicitly taken into account  the proposed methodology is applied to a real world case study of the greater berlin area  the results demonstrate the need to account for the spatial and temporal variation in the population since the use of static resident numbers would result in an overestimation of residential noise damages  going beyond residential exposures  the inclusion of further activity types is found to have a substantial effect on the results  assuming individuals at work or education to be additionally affected by noise  population exposures in the central business districts are much larger than in residential areas  the proposed approach may be seen as a first step towards improved noise mapping standards to provide better recommendations for policy makers and ensure a more efficient use of noise control strategies   c  2017 elsevier ltd  all rights reserved  
 an agent based day to day adjustment process for modeling  mobility as a service  with a two sided flexible transport market due to advances in communications technologies and social networks  flexible mobility systems such as taxi  carpool and demand responsive transit have gained interest among practitioners and researchers as a solution to address such problems as the  first last mile problem   while recent research has modeled these systems using agent based stochastic day to day processes  they assume only traveler adjustment under a one sided market setting  what if such systems are naturally  two sided markets  like uber or airbnb  in this study  we explore flexible transport services in the framework of two sided markets  and extend an earlier day to day adjustment process to include day to day adjustment of the service operator s  as the seller and the built environment as the platform of a two sided market  we use the ramsey pricing criterion for social optimum to show that a perfectly matched state from a day to day process is equivalent to a social optimum  a case study using real data from oakville  ontario  as a first last mile problem example demonstrates the sensitivity of the day to day model to operating policies  computational experiments confirm the existence of locally stable states  more importantly  the experiments show the existence of thresholds from which network externalities cause two sided and one sided market equilibria to diverge   c  2017 elsevier ltd  all rights reserved

 an approach to geometry based dynamic location referencing introduction an important requirement for knowledge infrastructures in smart cities is the continuous updating of location based information  protocols for dynamic location referencing like e g  openlr or agora c tackle the problem of accurately matching locations between dissimilar digital maps  they are map agnostic and aim at limiting the amount of descriptive data to reduce bandwidth  however  there are applications for which the weaker requirement of map independence is completely adequate  and for some there are even no restrictions in bandwidth  e g  in the ec funded project rosatte  and in the dlr projects mobilind and keepmoving   and with relaxed constraints it is possible to learn from methods in similar areas like road network matching and map conflation  in order to achieve a more accurate solution  following this path  this paper presents a map independent approach developed in the ongoing dlr project i  move  which can be combined with a bandwidth efficient dynamic location referencing method like e g  openlr to target applications with bandwidth restrictions  methods the proposed new approach works line oriented and is guided by a measure of geometric dissimilarity  it is a top down approach  recursively splitting up the source route into parts  thereby following a divide and conquer strategy to reduce the problem until it can be solved trivially  results it is currently capable of mapping closed line locations  i e  circular routes  representing either the boundaries of areas or the tours of e g  delivery trucks  from a teleatlas map to a navteq map on the fly with a success rate of 97 5   openlr  only 82 5    and also capable of mapping short line locations  i e  linear routes  on the fly between the same maps  with a success rate of 99 7   openlr  91 9    conclusion in conclusion  the new approach to match linear or circular routes between two dissimilar maps is highly accurate and map independent  but access to both involved maps is required  the approach can also be combined with a bandwidth efficient dynamic location referencing method like e g  openlr to obtain a compact format before the descriptive data is transmitted  
 an approach to transportation network analysis via transferable utility games network connectivity is an important aspect of any transportation network  as the role of the network is to provide a society with the ability to easily travel from point to point using various modes  a basic question in network analysis concerns how  important  each node is  an important node might  for example  greatly contribute to short connections between many pairs of nodes  handle a large amount of the traffic  generate relevant information  represent a bridge between two areas  etc  in order to quantify the relative importance of nodes  one possible approach uses the concept of centrality  a limitation of classical centrality measures is the fact that they evaluate nodes based on their individual contributions to the functioning of the network  the present paper introduces a game theory approach  based on cooperative games with transferable utility  given a transportation network  a game is defined taking into account the network topology  the weights associated with the arcs  and the demand based on an origin destination matrix  weights associated with nodes   the network nodes represent the players in such a game  the shapley value  which measures the relative importance of the players in transferable utility games  is used to identify the nodes that have a major role  for several network topologies  a comparison is made with well known centrality measures  the results show that the suggested centrality measures outperform the classical ones  and provide an innovative approach for transportation network analysis   c  2017 elsevier ltd  all rights reserved

 an empirical analysis of delays in the turkish airlines network this paper investigates the determinants of delays on international and domestic routes of turkish airlines in 2014  focusing on the effects of airport market share and airport market concentration  when examining the impact of airport market share  we find that delays are decreasing in market share for both domestic and international routes  we use market concentration to test whether airlines internalize the cost of the delays for their passengers  we find results that are consistent with the internalization hypothesis on domestic routes  however  on international routes  our estimates are inconsistent with the internalization hypothesis  we propose that these results may be due to market share being more critical than market concentration in determining delays and that the internalization effect is limited  additionally  we find that delays are lower at airports that connect to more destinations   c  2017 elsevier ltd  all rights reserved  
 an empirical analysis of maritime cluster evolution from the port development perspective   cases of london and hong kong the maritime industry has adopted the concept of clustering to promote the growth of related maritime sectors  based on the theoretical development of maritime cluster evolution in the current research literature  components and functions of maritime clusters are observed to have changed over time  however  very few empirical studies have been conducted on maritime cluster evolution that reflect the diverse components and their interactions within a cluster  particularly  there is insufficient literature that systematically studies the relationship between ports and other maritime sectors  though the port is deemed to play an important role among sectors in maritime cluster development  this paper aims to fill these research gaps by analysing two cases   london and hong kong  london is considered as an international maritime service centre  while hong kong is en route to be an international maritime service centre  with the latter cluster possesses a supportive port while the former does not  grounded on the symbiosis theory  this paper examines the evolution of maritime clusters empirically through investigating the interactions between a port and other sectors within a maritime cluster with the lotka volterra model  empirical results show that advanced maritime services  namely marine insurance and shipbroking  benefit from port development in london  however  these maritime services sectors are in pure competition with the port sector in hong kong  the research provides reference for policy makers on the dynamic development path of maritime clusters in practice   c  2017 elsevier ltd  all rights reserved  
 an empirical analysis of run off road injury severity crashes involving large trucks in recent years  there has been an increasing interest in understanding the contributory factors to run off road  ror  crashes in the us  especially those where large trucks are involved  although there have been several efforts to understand large truck crashes  the relationship between crash factors  crash severity  and ror crashes is not clearly understood  the intent of this research is to develop statistical models that provide additional insight into the effects that various contributory factors related to the person  driver   vehicle  crash  roadway  and environment have on ror injury severity  an ordered random parameter probit was estimated to predict the likelihood of three injury severity categories using oregon crash data  severe  minor  and no injury  the modeling approach accounts for unobserved heterogeneity  i e   unobserved factors   the results showed that five parameter estimates were found to be random and normally distributed  and varied across ror crash observations  these were factors related to crashes that occurred between january and april  raised median type  loss of control of a vehicle  the indicator variable of speed not involved  and the indicator variable of two vehicles or more involved in the crashes  in contrast  eight variables were found to be fixed across ror observations  looking more closely at the fixed parameter results  large truck drivers who are not licensed in oregon have a higher probability of experiencing no injury ror crash outcomes  and human related factor  fatigue  increases the probability of minor injury  the modeling framework presented in this work offers a flexible methodology to analyze ror crashes involving large trucki while accounting for unobserved heterogeneity  this information can aid safety planners and the trucking industry in identifying appropriate countermeasures to help mitigate the number and severity of large truck ror crashes   c  2017 elsevier ltd  all rights reserved

 an evaluation of the economic and business investment impact of an integrated package of public transport improvements funded by a workplace parking levy hypothecated revenue from the nottingham workplace parking levy  wpl  is being used to fund additional tram lines  refurbish the nottingham railway station and to sustain the supported linkbus network  this strategy aims to constrain congestion  cater for future economic growth and make nottingham a more attractive location for business investment and to live  visit and work  literature reveals that the nottingham wpl forms a relatively small proportion of a business  turnover and that the availability of an efficient public transport system is an important factor in business location decisions  consequently  central to the wpl package is the expectation that an improved public transport network will prove sufficiently attractive to the business community to offset any perceived negativity of the wpl and hence make nottingham an attractive business location relative to other uk and european cities  this paper aims to evaluate the economic and inward investment impact of the nottingham wpl package  the theory of change approach is used to analyse the impact complemented by bench marking against comparator cities  a range of available indicators are used including economic output  employment  net business vat registrations  the level of investment enquiries and successes and investment case studies  the paper concludes that there is strong evidence that the wpl is not having a significantly negative impact on inward investment  additionally  strong growth in employment and output  combined with a positive movement of inward investment indicators  suggests that nottingham remains relatively attractive to investors  there is emerging evidence from investment case studies that the public transport improvements are playing a role in this   c  2017 published by elsevier ltd  
 an evaluation of the impact of the dublin port tunnel and hgv management strategy on air pollution emissions heavy goods vehicles  hgvs  contribute a large proportion  about 40   of the emissions of air pollutants while only representing a small proportion  about 10   of all transport operations  in ireland  the dublin port tunnel  dpt  was opened in 2006 as a dedicated route for hgvs between dublin port and the motorway system in order to reduce the hgv volume in the city centre  an hgv management strategy to restrict hgvs travelling through the city centre was also introduced  the aim of this study was to estimate the emission changes brought about by these infrastructural and regulatory changes  a transport model built in visum was utilized  emissions were calculated using copert 4  the results showed that the dpt and hgv management strategy reduced the traffic in the city centre  and the hgv management improved traffic speed distribution  however the dpt and hgv management resulted in vehicles travelling further  travel distance increased by 16  and 51   respectively  and increased the total emissions  increased by 8  and 21  in no   respectively   total traffic and emission changes over time in dublin were also estimated in this study  the traffic conditions and emissions in 2006  2007 and 2013 were evaluated and the results indicated that a travel demand reduction in 2013 could also improve speed distribution  emissions reduced from 2006 to 2013 and the fleet technology improvements had a positive impact on this reduction  the study shows that a traffic management policy and or infrastructure change may bring about some localised environmental benefits within the management area  however  such a policy does not always reduce the total traffic emissions in the network as a whole and the impact to the wider environment could be negative in some circumstances   c  2017 elsevier ltd  all rights reserved

 an exact algorithm for the green vehicle routing problem we propose an exact algorithm for solving the green vehicle routing problem  g vrp   the g vrp models the optimal routing of an alternative fuel vehicle fleet to serve a set of geographically scattered customers  vehicles  fuel autonomy and possible refueling stops en route are explicitly modeled and maximum duration constraints are imposed on each vehicle route  we model the g vrp as a set partitioning problem in which columns represent feasible routes corresponding to simple circuits in a multigraph  each node in the multigraph represents one customer and each arc between two customers represents a nondominated path through a set of refueling stations visited by a vehicle when traveling directly between the two customers  we strengthen the set partitioning formulation by adding valid inequalities including k path cuts and describe a method for separating them  we provide computational results on benchmark instances showing that the algorithm can optimally solve instances with up to similar to 110 customers  
 an exact approach for a variant of the pollution routing problem the pollution routing problem  prp  is a recently introduced green vehicle routing problem in the field of green logistics  it concerns routing a number of vehicles to serve a set of geographically dispersed customers within their time windows  jointly with determining their speed on each arc so as to minimize fuel and driving costs  because of its complexity  all known solution methods are based on  meta   heuristics  this paper presents an exact solution based on a branch and price algorithm for a variant of the prp  the master problem is a set partitioning problem  and the pricing problem is a speed and start time elementary shortest path problem with resource constraints  in which the speed and start time at the depot needs to be decided on for each individual route  the master problem is solved by means of column generation  and a tailored labeling algorithm is used to solve the pricing problem  new dominance criteria are developed to discard unpromising labels by exploiting the structure of the ready time and the fuel consumption functions  extensive computational experiments show the value of the proposed algorithm  
 an exact method for vehicle routing and truck driver scheduling problems in most developed countries working hours of truck drivers are constrained by hours of service regulations  when optimizing vehicle routes  trucking companies must consider these constraints to assure that drivers can comply with the regulations  this paper studies the combined vehicle routing and truck driver scheduling problem  vrtdsp   which generalizes the well known vehicle routing problem with time windows by considering working hour constraints  a branch and price algorithm for solving the vrtdsp is presented  this is the first algorithm that solves the vrtdsp to proven optimality  
 an examination of how changing patterns of school travel mode impact moderate to vigorous physical activity among adolescents over time background  this study examined temporal variations in school travel mode and whether these variations predicted changes in moderate to vigorous physical activity  mvpa  among adolescents  grades 9 to 12   methods  we analyzed data from years 1  2 and 3 of the compass study  students included in the analysis were those who had provided information on sociodemographic factors  mvpa and school travel modes  a final longitudinal sample included 19 868 participants for the analyses related to travel mode to school  am period  and 17 678 for the travel mode from school  pm period   the proportion of participants who changed their school travel modes between years was calculated to determine the stability of school travel mode  linear mixed models were used to examine whether changes in mode predicted changes in mvpa one year later  these models adjusted for sociodemographic factors as covariates and accounted for the clustering within schools  results  stability in school travel mode was observed for both time periods  across data collection waves  only 9 3  consistently used an active transportation mode in the am period and 15 6  in the pm period  only 2 5  switched from a passive to active mode in the am period and 3 1  in the pm period  whereas 3 5  switched from an active to passive mode in the am period and 5 2  in the pm period  no significant association was observed for the am period  for the pm period  the decrease in mvpa was significantly greater in adolescents who switched from an active to a passive transportation mode than those who remained using a passive transportation mode across years  conclusion  school travel makes a contribution to the amount of mvpa youth accumulate during the school week although evidence for this was restricted to those shifting from active to passive modes in the afternoon period  
 an examination of the relationship between measures of impulsivity and risky simulated driving amongst young drivers the risky driving of young drivers may owe in part to youthful motivations  such as experience seeking  authority rebellion  desire for peer approval  combined with incompletely developed impulse control  although self reported impulsiveness has been positively associated with self reports of risky driving  results based on objective measures of response inhibition  e g   go no go tasks  have been inconclusive  the present study examined interrelationships between measures of response inhibition  self report impulsiveness scales  and responses to events during a simulated drive that were designed to detect impulsive  unsafe behaviours  e g   turning across on coming traffic   participants were 72 first year psychology students  more speeding and  unsafe  responding to critical events during simulated driving were associated with poorer impulse control as assessed by commission errors during a go no go task  these results consolidate evidence for a relationship between impulse control and risky driving amongst young drivers  
 an examination of the revenue generating capability of co branded cards associated with frequent flyer programmes the frequent flyer program  ffp  is fast changing the scope of ancillary revenues  the sale of miles to third party partners has epitomised the revenue generating capability of ffps  which has yielded co branded credit cards as a prominent instrument in substantially boosting earning streams  this study triangulates the tripartite composition of airlines  banks and payment networks that formulate the sale of miles and the resulting value that accrues  a survey was conducted at a prominent commercial conference devoted to the subject area  along with secondary data to ascertain the financial impact of today s ffps and to investigate the underpinning factors as to how they are producing such stellar incremental revenue streams  the findings indicate that there are a low number of active ffp members  while one third of new members signup for a co branded credit card  the hierarchical tier structure supporting the compositional framework of ffps has a significant impact on membership levels and loyalty engagement  a large proportion of ancillaries now evolve from airline co branded credit cards which have significantly contributed in propping up the overall value of ffps  banks are distributing record numbers of airline co branded credit cards where the top tier segment spend heavily  while a substantial proportion of such rewards cards now propagate through the payment networks  the symbiotic commercial partnership that is being forged between airlines and banks is prodigious and the industry has engineered a tool that harnesses noticeable returns which can significantly assist in sustaining the financial future in an ever changing landscape   c  2017 published by elsevier ltd  
 an expectation maximization algorithm to estimate the integrated choice and latent variable model as computing capability has grown dramatically  the transport choice model has rigorously included latent variables  however  integrated latent and choice variable  iclv  models are hampered by a serious problem that is caused by the maximum simulated likelihood method  the method cannot properly reproduce the true coefficients  which is a problem that is often referred to as a lack of empirical identification  in particular  the problem is exacerbated particularly when an iclv model is calibrated based on cross sectional data  an expectation maximization  em  algorithm has been successfully employed to calibrate a random coefficient choice model  but it has never been applied to the calibration of an iclv model  in this study  an em algorithm was adapted to calibrate an iclv model  and it successfully reproduced the true coefficients in the model  the main contribution of adopting an em algorithm was to simplify the calibration procedure by decomposing the procedure into three well known econometric problems  a weighted linear regression  a weighted discrete choice problem  and a weighted ordinal choice problem  simulation experiments also confirmed that an em algorithm is a stable method for averting the problem of lack of empirical identification  
 an experiment on rider stability while mounting  comparing middle aged and elderly cyclists on pedelecs and conventional bicycles pedelecs  popular among elderly cyclists  are associated with a higher injury risk than conventional bicycles  about 17  of these injuries are due to falls while  dis mounting  using instrumented bicycles  this study aimed to identify factors contributing to the stability of self chosen mounting methods in four user groups  30 45 versus 65  years of age and males versus females  mounting stability on pedelecs was compared with that on conventional bicycles  in controlled experimental setting  task in a fenced off parking lot  but also in real traffic conditions  traffic light turns green   two mounting phases were differentiated  phase 1 as the transition from  earth bound  to  balance  and phase 2 as the acceleration to achieve harmonized cycling  stability was operationalised in terms of the duration of these phases  the shorter their duration  the higher the stability  pedelecs were shown to be less stable in phase 1 than conventional bicycles  irrespective of user group  for all user groups  only in phase 2 the advantages of electrical support kicked in  results obtained in traffic conditions confirmed the patterns obtained in the controlled setting  with as only difference a lower speed in traffic conditions  which held for both mounting phases and bicycle types  also measures of physical limitations due to low muscle strength were shown only to be compensated for by pedal support in phase 2 and not in phase 1  further  mounting characteristics affected pedelec stability in phase 1 and not in phase 2  higher stability was associated with a  starting while seated and b  using the pedal to push off  although  these mounting characteristics were confounded with age  gender  and muscle strength  the pattern of results still suggest certain mounting techniques to be more beneficial for pedelecs  the results further illustrate the importance of a deeper understanding of the interactions of bicycle types and user groups on critical manoeuvres and their potential contribution to the optimisation of pedelec design and the training of safe mounting techniques   c  2017 elsevier ltd  all rights reserved  
 an improved approach for association rule mining using a multi criteria decision support system  a case study in road safety purpose road accidents have come to be considered a major public health problem worldwide  the aim of many studies is therefore to identify the main factors contributing to the severity of crashes  methods this paper examines a large scale data mining technique known as association rule mining  which can predict future accidents in advance and allow drivers to avoid the dangers  however  this technique produces a very large number of decision rules  preventing decisionmakers from making their own selection of the most relevant rules  in this context  the integration of a multi criteria decision analysis approach would be particularly useful for decision makers affected by the redundancy of the extracted rules  conclusion an analysis of road accidents in the province of marrakech  morocco  between 2004 and 2014 shows that the proposed approach serves this purpose  it may provide meaningful information that could help in developing suitable prevention policies to improve road safety  
 an integrated model for road capacity choice and cordon toll pricing in this paper  an analytical model is proposed to address  road capacity choice and cordon toll pricing issues for an urban transportation corridor  in the proposed model  the road capacity  toll location and level are considered as decision variables  and the effects of self financing and subsidy constraints on these variables are explored  it has been shown in the numerical studies that the self financing requirement can lead to a decreased social welfare  and subsidies in certain ranges are welfare improving  results also show that subsidy increments yield disproportionately smaller welfare improvements  which is a sign of low efficiency   c  2017 elsevier ltd  all rights reserved  
 an integrated modelling approach for the bicriterion vehicle routing and scheduling problem with environmental considerations the consideration of pollution in routing decisions gives rise to a new routing framework where measures of the environmental implications are traded off with business performance measures  to address this type of routing decisions  we formulate and solve a bi objective time  load and path dependent vehicle routing problem with time windows  btl vrptw   the proposed formulation incorporates a travel time model representing realistically time varying traffic conditions  a key feature of the problem under consideration is the need to address simultaneously routing and path finding decisions  to cope with the computational burden arising from this property of the problem we propose a network reduction approach  computational tests on the effect of the network reduction approach on determining non dominated solutions are reported  a generic solution framework is proposed to address the btl vrptw  the proposed framework combines any technique that creates capacity feasible routes with a routing and scheduling method that aims to convert the identified routes to problem solutions  we show that transforming a set of routes to btl vrptw solutions is equivalent to solving a bi objective time dependent shortest path problem on a specially structured graph  we propose a backward label setting technique to solve the emerging problem that takes advantage of the special structure of the graph  the proposed generic solution framework is implemented by integrating the routing and scheduling method into an ant colony system algorithm  the accuracy of the proposed algorithm was assessed on the basis of its capability to determine minimum travel time and fuel consumption solutions  although the computational results are encouraging  there is ample room for future research in algorithmic advances on addressing the proposed problem   c  2017 elsevier ltd  all rights reserved  
 an integrated terminal operating system for enhancing the efficiency of seaport terminal operators ga seaport terminal is a vital link in the global supply chain which has a profound impact on port competitiveness and international trade  however  ongoing worldwide economic slumps  coupled with the proliferation of terminal operators  have created a glut for terminal related logistics services and intensified competition among terminal operators  as a way to better utilize the existing terminal infrastructure and enhance terminal operating efficiencies  we propose an integrated terminal operating system that can reduce duplicated investments in equipment  redundant workforce  and non valueadding processes  while standardizing terminal services including loading  unloading  discharging  and transferring cargo  to verify the usefulness of the proposed integrated terminal operating system  we develop key performance indicators of terminal operations which help to measure the comparative performances of both an integrated group and a non integrated group of terminal operators and then formulate viable strategic options for creating  win win   situations for terminal operators and their stakeholders including port administrators  in so doing  we examine the current practices of terminal operators at the incheon inner harbor in korea through in depth interviews and then identify critical success factors for integrated terminal operations based on a questionnaire survey and analytic hierarchy process  these factors include the terminal operator s cargo attraction level  cargo turnover ratio  cargo storage capacity  and ability to comply with government rules and policies  
 an investigation of timed transfer coordination using event based multi agent simulation while transfers extend transit service coverage by omnidirectional connections  poorly coordinated transfers significantly increase passenger waiting time  especially in case of missed connections  this paper proposes a simulation approach to investigate the feasibilities of different timed transfer strategies in both schedule planning and operational control  in particular  an event based multi agent simulation  emas  model is proposed  that captures the interactions between the transit vehicles  its passengers and the  urban  environment by considering the transit vehicles and passengers as separate classes of agents which interact in a dynamic system  the model is validated by using observed automatic vehicle location  avl  and automatic fare collection  afc  data from two routes with transfers in south east queensland  australia  emas is then used to evaluate different timed transfer strategies for both schedule planning and operational control  the analysis on timed transfers in schedule planning provides valuable insights on the probability of missing a transfer and extra waiting time for transfer  six different strategies for timed transfers in operational control are thoroughly tested  including an elaborate sensitivity analysis of the effectiveness of the strategies for different levels of transferring demand and schedule headways  this paper assists transit operators to exploit observed avl and afc data to augment the transfer coordination quality   c  2017 published by elsevier ltd  
 an investment appraisal method to compare lng fueled and conventional vessels ever stricter emission regulations stimulate vessel owners to consider the adoption of alternative marine fuels  such as liquefied natural gas  lng   in deciding whether to invest in lng fueled vessels  initial investment and operating costs are decisive factors that have not yet been fully studied in the literature  in this paper  we present a new investment appraisal method to compare the costs of lng fueled vessels with conventional vessels  we analyze the fuel costs and overall exploitation costs by simulating bunker planning decisions under stochastic fuel prices  presence in emission controlled areas  and route lengths  our analyses reveal that the fuel costs of lng fueled vessels are often lower than those of conventional vessels  even under unfavorable lng prices  due to the higher initial investment costs in lng fueled vessels  these fuel cost reductions do not always translate into lower overall exploitation costs  by conducting numerical experiments  we identified conditions under which the exploitation costs of lng fueled vessels are lower than conventional vessels

 an iterative auction for carrier collaboration in truckload pickup and delivery while carriers can collaborate to reduce empty traveling miles in truckload shipping  this is difficult to realize because each party is self interested who may not share his private information that is necessary for the cooperation  in this paper  we propose an iterative auction scheme  which enables carriers to collaborate by exchanging their shipping requests iteratively  the auction is shown to be incentive compatible  individually rational  budget balanced  monotonic  and convergent  computational experiments indicate that it has small efficiency loss and can significantly improve carriers  profits  we also develop two acceleration methods and extend the auction to more general problems  
 an optimal path model for the risk averse traveler in this paper we discuss stochastic optimal path problems where the goal is to find a path that has minimal expected cost and at the same time is less risky  in terms of travel time  than a given benchmark path  the model is suitable for a risk averse traveler who prefers a path with a more guaranteed travel time to another path that could be faster but could also be slower  such risk attitude is incorporated using the concept of second order stochastic dominance constraints  a recently developed theory for optimization problems with stochastic dominance constraints ensures that the resulting problem can be written as a large linear integer program with binary variables  for networks of realistic size  however  such a direct approach is not practical because of the size of the resulting optimization problem  moreover  the solution returned by the model may contain cycles  which is clearly undesirable from a practical perspective  a number of strategies are explored to solve the problem  first  we prove that cycles can be prevented by a simple modification of the model if the arc travel times are mutually independent  we then propose a sample average approximation approach to the problem using samples from the distribution of travel times  because of the randomness resulting from sampling  it is important that statistical guarantees for the solution returned by the algorithm be given  and we provide heuristic procedures to deal with stochastic constraints  we also incorporate a branch and cut approach that exploits the structure of the problem to deal with the integrality constraints more efficiently  we present some numerical experiments for a 1 522 arc system that corresponds to a large portion of the chicago area network  the results show that our approach can solve the problem very effectively  producing solutions with statistical guarantees of optimality within a reasonable computational time  
 an optimal stopping approach to managing travel time uncertainty for time sensitive customer pickup in dynamic vehicle routing  it is common to respond to real time information with immediate updates to routes and fleet management  however  even if routes are updated continuously  in practice  some decisions once made are difficult to reverse  at times  it may thus be valuable to wait for additional information before acting on a decision  we use the theory of optimal stopping to determine the optimal timing of a recourse action when vehicles are likely to miss customer deadlines due to travel time stochasticities and backup services are available  the factors involved in making this decision   that is  the likelihood that the primary vehicle will arrive late  the location of the backup vehicle  and value of waiting for additional travel time information   each change dynamically over time  we develop a recourse model that accounts for this complexity  we formulate the optimal recourse policy as a stochastic dynamic program  properties of the optimal policy are derived analytically  and its solution is approximated with a binomial lattice method used in the pricing of american options  finally  we develop a two stage stochastic optimization approach to show how the opportunity to take recourse dynamically might be integrated into a priori scheduling and routing  the framework is demonstrated for a stochastic dial a  ride application in which taxis serve as backup to ridesharing vehicles   c  2017 elsevier ltd  all rights reserved

 analysis of an idealized system of demand adaptive paired line hybrid transit this paper proposes and analyzes a new transit system that integrates the traditional fixed route service with a demand adaptive service  the demand adaptive service connects passengers from their origin destination to the fixed route service in order to improve accessability  the proposed hybrid design is unique in that it operates the demand adaptive service with a stable headway to cover all stops along a paired fixed route line  pairing demand adaptive vehicles with a fixed route line simplifies the complexity of on demand routing  because the vehicles can follow a more predictable path and can be dispatched on intervals coordinated with the fixed route line  the design of the two services are closely coupled to minimize the total system cost  which incudes both the transit agency s operating cost and the user cost  the optimal design model is formulated as a mixed integer program and solved using a commercially available metaheuristic  numerical experiments are conducted to compare the demand adaptive paired line hybrid transit  dapl ht  system with two related transit systems that may be considered its special cases  a fixed route system and a flexible route system  we show that the dapl ht system outperforms the other two systems under a wide range of demand levels and in various scenarios of input parameters  a discrete event simulation model is also developed and applied to confirm the correctness of the analytical results   c  2017 elsevier ltd  all rights reserved

 analysis of factors affecting the severity of crashes in urban road intersections road crashes are events which depend on a variety of factors and which exhibit different magnitudes of outputs when evaluated with respect to the effects on road users  despite a lot of research into the evaluation of crash likelihood and frequency  only a few works have focused exclusively on crash severity with these limited to sections of freeways and multilane highways  hence  at present there is a large gap in knowledge on factors affecting the severity of crashes for other road categories  facilities  and scenarios  the paper deals with the identification of factors affecting crash severity level at urban road intersections  two official crash records together with a weather database  a traffic data source with data aggregated into 5 min intervals  and further information characterising the investigated urban intersections were used  analyses were performed by using a back propagation neural network model and a generalized linear mixed model that enable the impact assessment of flow and other variables  both methods demonstrate that flows play a role in the prediction of severity levels  
 analysis of multiple tank car releases in train accidents there are annually over two million carloads of hazardous materials transported by rail in the united states  the american railroads use large blocks of tank cars to transport petroleum crude oil and other flammable liquids from production to consumption sites  being different from roadway transport of hazardous materials  a train accident can potentially result in the derailment and release of multiple tank cars  which may result in significant consequences  the prior literature predominantly assumes that the occurrence of multiple tank car releases in a train accident is a series of independent bernoulli processes  and thus uses the binomial distribution to estimate the total number of tank car releases given the number of tank cars derailing or damaged  this paper shows that the traditional binomial model can incorrectly estimate multiple tank car release probability by magnitudes in certain circumstances  thereby significantly affecting railroad safety and risk analysis  to bridge this knowledge gap  this paper proposes a novel  alternative correlated binomial  cb  model that accounts for the possible correlations of multiple tank car releases in the same train  we test three distinct correlation structures in the cb model  and find that they all outperform the conventional binomial model based on empirical tank car accident data  the analysis shows that considering tank car release correlations would result in a significantly improved fit of the empirical data than otherwise  consequently  it is prudent to consider alternative modeling techniques when analyzing the probability of multiple tank car releases in railroad accidents

 analysis of traffic revenue risk factors in bot road projects in developing countries the use of build operate transfer  bot  model for transport infrastructure projects delivery  most especially road projects has increased over the past decades  however  the growing concern is how the concessionaires will recoup their money at operation phase in bot road projects  due to the traffic revenue risk that is highly unpredictable  particularly in developing countries  yet effort at investigating traffic revenue risk factors in bot road projects through an empirical method in developing countries received scant attention  it is against this backdrop that this study identified and critically assessed the traffic revenue risk factors in bot road projects in nigeria  this study further identified and assessed the mitigation strategies to traffic revenue risk in bot road projects  in achieving this  the study adopted three different data gathering phases to include literature review  a preliminary survey  and questionnaire survey  the questionnaires were administered to three different primary stakeholder groups comprised public sector authorities  i e  ministries  department  agencies   concessionaires  and lenders banks involved from conception to operation phase of bot transport projects in nigeria  data collected were analysed using mean score  kruskal wallis test  and factor analysis  the study  through factor analysis  grouped the 25 identified traffic revenue risk factors into 3 principal factors  similarly  the factor analysis classified the 19 identified mitigation strategies into 4 key factors  it is believed that this study will benefit the policymakers and other stakeholders to draw policy recommendations that will positively influence the development of bot road projects in nigeria and developing countries at large  
 analysis of traffic statics and dynamics in signalized networks  a poincare map approach an understanding of traffic statics and dynamics is critical for developing effective and efficient control strategies for a signalized road network with turning movements  especially under oversaturated conditions  in this study  we first describe traffic dynamics in a signalized double ring network with the link queue model  which is a space continuous approximation of the network kinematic wave model  and rewrite it as a switched affine system  assuming a triangular traffic flow fundamental diagram  then we define periodic density evolution orbits as stationary states in the network and introduce a poincare map in densities  whose fixed points correspond to stationary states  with short cycle lengths and identical green times and retaining ratios in both rings  we are able to derive the closed form of the poincare map  from which we can analytically solve stationary states and study their stability properties  it is found that a stationary state can be asymptotically stable  lyapunov stable  or unstable  by defining the network flow density relation in stationary states as the macroscopic fundamental diagram  mfd   we analytically derive an approximate closed form formula for mfd with green ratios and retaining ratios as parameters  we confirm that in stationary states the network flow rate may not be uniquely defined  and the network can reach a gridlock state at relatively low densities  we also analyze the convergence patterns to asymptotically stable gridlock states with different retaining ratios and initial densities  with more general signal settings and retaining ratios  we develop a secant method to numerically solve the fixed points of the poincare maps and plot the corresponding mfds  furthermore  numerical simulations are used to study traffic statics in a homogeneous signalized grid network  simulation results reveal a high level of similarity in traffic patterns between the signalized double ring and grid networks and validate analytical insights obtained from the former  this study provides a springboard for future analytical and numerical studies on traffic statics and dynamics in more general signalized road networks  
 analysis of volatility in driving regimes extracted from basic safety messages transmitted between connected vehicles driving volatility captures the extent of speed variations when a vehicle is being driven  extreme longitudinal variations signify hard acceleration or braking  warnings and alerts given to drivers can reduce such volatility potentially improving safety  energy use  and emissions  this study develops a fundamental understanding of instantaneous driving decisions  needed for hazard anticipation and notification systems  and distinguishes normal from anomalous driving  in this study  driving task is divided into distinct yet unobserved regimes  the research issue is to characterize and quantify these regimes in typical driving cycles and the associated volatility of each regime  explore when the regimes change and the key correlates associated with each regime  using basic safety message  bsm  data from the safety pilot model deployment in ann arbor  michigan  two  and three regime dynamic markov switching models are estimated for several trips undertaken on various roadway types  while thousands of instrumented vehicles with vehicle to vehicle  v2v  and vehicle to infrastructure  v2i  communication systems are being tested  nearly 1 4 million records of bsms  from 184 trips undertaken by 71 instrumented vehicles are analyzed in this study  then even more detailed analysis of 43 randomly chosen trips  n   714 340 bsm records  that were undertaken on various roadway types is conducted  the results indicate that acceleration and deceleration are two distinct regimes  and as compared to acceleration  drivers decelerate at higher rates  and braking is significantly more volatile than acceleration  different correlations of the two regimes with instantaneous driving contexts are explored  with a more generic three regime model specification  the results reveal high rate acceleration  high rate deceleration  and cruise constant as the three distinct regimes that characterize a typical driving cycle  moreover  given in a high rate regime  drivers  on average tend to decelerate at a higher rate than their rate of acceleration  importantly  compared to cruise constant regime  drivers  instantaneous driving decisions are more volatile both in  high rate  acceleration as well as  high rate  deceleration regime  the study contributes to analyzing volatility in shortterm driving decisions  and how changes in driving regimes can be mapped to a combination of local traffic states surrounding the vehicle  published by elsevier ltd  
 analytical and scalable analysis of transient tandem markovian finite capacity queueing networks this paper proposes an analytical model to approximate the transient aggregate joint queue length distribution of tandem finite  space  capacity markovian networks  the methodology combines ideas from transient aggregation disaggregation techniques as well as transient network decomposition methods  the complexity of the proposed method is linear in the number of queues and is independent of the space capacities of the individual queues  this makes it a suitable approach for the analysis of large scale networks  the transient joint distributions are validated versus simulation estimates  the model is then used to describe urban traffic dynamics and to address a dynamic traffic signal control problem  the signal plan analysis shows the added value of using joint distributional information  and more generally spatial temporal between link dependency information  to enhance urban traffic operations  
 analyzing driver pedestrian interaction in a mixed street environment using a driving simulator this paper presents the design  analysis and results of a driving simulator experiment conducted to study the interaction between drivers and pedestrians in a mixed street environment  ninety six students of the american university of beirut  aub  participated in the experiment that took place in the transportation and infrastructure laboratory of aub  the study looked at the driver pedestrian interaction from the driver s perspective  by quantifying the effects of different scenario variables on the driving behavior of the participants  kruskall wallis test shows that drivers  behavior in proximity of pedestrians tends to be statistically significantly less aggressive when their approach velocity is lower  curb side parking is not allowed  a crosswalk exists  and the number of pedestrians crossing the street is higher  a discrete choice model for the yielding behavior of the drivers was also developed as a function of different predictor variables  five out of the six predictors considered  except for gender  had a statistically significant effect on the yielding behavior  particularly the effects of curbside parking  number of pedestrians crossing  and approach velocity  the model was then used to evaluate the effect of policy variables on the yielding probabilities of the drivers  the results of this study enrich current knowledge and understanding of drivers  behavior and their interaction with pedestrians  especially with studying the effects of scenario variables that were not addressed before  this would help planners propose and evaluate safety measures and traffic calming techniques to reduce the risks on pedestrians  the study also confirms the effectiveness of driving simulators in studying driver pedestrian interactions

 anger expression among danish cyclists and drivers  a comparison based on mode specific anger expression inventories based on the short form of the driving anger expression inventory  dax short  15 item   the present study developed an adapted version of the dax for cyclists  cax  14 items   the data basis was an online survey of 2000 inhabitants of denmark  a principle component analysis on the translated dax short confirmed the 4 factor solution of the original study differentiating between  1  personal physical aggressive expression   2  use of a vehicle to express anger   3  verbal aggressive expression and  4  adaptive constructive expression  in case of cycling  the factor  use of a vehicle to express anger  only included one item and was left out  based on the results  reliable subscales were developed  drivers scored higher in verbal aggressive expression than cyclists  while there was no significant difference in constructive expression  the subscales for drivers and cyclists showed significant relations to age  gender  self reported aggressive behaviours and traffic fines  women scored for instance lower in physical expression  while older people scored higher in constructive expression  the effect of age and gender on anger expression among drivers and cyclists remained significant when controlling for exposure and other factors in linear regression analyses  these analyses also showed a relationship between a positive attitude towards driving and higher levels of anger expression among drivers  while this was not the case for cyclists  
 angry thoughts in spanish drivers and their relationship with crash related events  the mediation effect of aggressive and risky driving several studies have related aggressive and risky driving behaviours to accidents  however  the cognitive processes associated with driving aggression have received very little attention in the scientific literature  with the aim of shedding light on this topic  the present research was carried out on a sample of 414 participants in order to validate the driver s angry thoughts questionnaire  datq  with a sample of spanish drivers and to test the hypothesis of the mediation effect of aggressive and risky driving on the relationship between drivers  angry thoughts and crash related events  the results showed a good fit with the five factor model of the questionnaire  judgmental and disbelieving thinking  pejorative labelling and verbally aggressive thinking  revenge and retaliatory thinking  physically aggressive thinking  and coping self instruction   moreover  slight gender differences were observed in drivers  angry thoughts  with women scoring higher than men  eta 2    0 03   however  younger drivers had higher scores than older drivers in general  eta 2    0 06   finally  several mediation effects of aggressive driving and risky driving on the relationship between aggressive thinking and the crash related events were found  implications of the results for research in traffic psychology and clinical assessment of aggressive drivers as well as limitations of the study are discussed  
 another look at the safety effects of horizontal curvature on rural two lane highways crash modification factors  cmfs  are used to represent the effects on crashes of changes to highway design elements and are usually obtained from observational studies based on reported crashes  the design element of interest for this paper is horizontal curvature on rural 2 lane highways  the data for this study came from the washington state database in the highway safety information system  hsis   crash prediction models are developed for curve sections on rural 2 lane highway and the tangent sections up  and down stream of the curve sections  different negative binomial models were developed for segments on level grades    3    moderate grades  3 6    and steep grades    6   to account for the confounding effects of gradient  the relationships between crashes at different traffic volumes and deflection angles are explored to illustrate how to get estimates of cmfs for increases in the minimum radius  considering the effect of increased tangent length for sharper curves  an effect that is overlooked in the highway safety manual cmf  in addition to the effect of gradient  the results of that exploration indicated that even at different design speeds and deflection angles  the cmf estimates for incremental increases in radius lie within the same range  and that the crash reduction rate  crr  is higher at segments on higher grades compared to the ones on lower grades  
 anticipation and post construction impact of a metro extension on residential values  the case of laval  canada   1995 2013 the application of hedonic pricing models has a long history in estimating the externalities associated with urban infrastructure  such as public transportation  however  results accuracy crucially depends on methodological and empirical considerations such as  i  presence of spatial latent component  spatial autocorrelation   ii  temporal breaks related to different periods over which the infrastructure is built  and iii  heterogeneity of the effect along the line and stations  this paper aims to assess the impact of montreal s metro extension to the suburb city of laval  announced in 1998 and started operating in 2007   a spatial difference in difference  sdid  estimator based on a repeated sales approach is used to isolate the impact of the proximity to the new infrastructure on single family house prices depending on the implementation phases and the stations  the results suggest that among the three new infrastructures  only one shows a positive impact of proximity after the first operation of the transit service  the study results tend to relativize the sometimes high expectations in terms of economic impacts of such a project  at least for residential properties

 application of an alternative expected marginal seat revenue method  emsrc  in unrestricted fare environments we reintroduce an expected revenue maximization formulation for airline seat allocation  we present a numerical method to find the exact solution to the integer programing problem  we further show that when this method is applied to a nested fare structure  it constitutes a heuristic method which has far better performance in an unrestricted fare environment  where fare buckets are completely undifferentiated  compared to emsra  emsrb and emsrb mr  with use of simulation  we show that this method can recapture a significant portion of the potential revenue loss when restrictions are removed  while its performance in a fully differentiated environment is only marginally inferior compared to other methods  this method is also applicable to hotels and cruise lines where not only are there fewer  fences  around different offered rates  but also there is a greater tendency for consumers to buy down since most bookings are fully refundable   c  2017 elsevier ltd  all rights reserved  
 application of bayesian informative priors to enhance the transferability of safety performance functions introduction  safety performance functions  spfs  are essential tools for highway agencies to predict crashes  identify hotspots and assess safety countermeasures  in the highway safety manual  hsm   a variety of spfs are provided for different types of roadway facilities  crash types and severity levels  agencies  lacking the necessary resources to develop own localized spfs  may opt to apply the hsm s spfs for their jurisdictions  yet  municipalities that want to develop and maintain their regional spfs might encounter the issue of the small sample bias  bayesian inference is being conducted to address this issue by combining the current data with prior information to achieve reliable results  it follows that the essence of bayesian statistics is the application of informative priors  obtained from other spfs or experts  experiences  method  in this study  we investigate the applicability of informative priors for bayesian negative binomial spfs for rural divided multilane highway segments in florida and california  an spf with non informative priors is developed for each state and its parameters  distributions are assigned to the other state s spf as informative priors  the performances of spfs are evaluated by applying each state s spfs to the other state  the analysis is conducted for both total  kabco  and severe  kab  crashes  results  conclusions and practical applications  as per the results  applying one state s spf with informative priors  which are the other state s spf independent variable estimates  to the latter state s conditions yields better goodness of fit  gof  values than applying the former state s spf with non informative priors to the conditions of the latter state  this is for both total and severe crash spfs  hence  for localities where it is not preferred to develop own localized spfs and adopt spfs from elsewhere to cut down on resources  application of informative priors is shown to facilitate the process   c  2017 national safety council and elsevier ltd  all rights reserved  
 application of gravity models with a fixed component in the international trade flows of coal  iron ore and crude oil as freight transport flows grow continuously  developing better quantitative models for forecasting future trade flows becomes more important  trade flows can be estimated by discrete choice theory  leading to gravity models formulations  at a given point in time  trade flows may also be affected by long term contracts or simply trading habits  this leads to situations where only a fraction of the market is subject to choice  in this article  we extend the traditional gravity model such that a fixed amount is separated from observed trade flows and only residuals are subject to discrete choice  we apply our model on coal  iron ore and oil seaborne trade flows and demonstrate that the proposed construction results in a significantly better fit for the observed data  this observation is important in predicting future trade volumes

 are statutory passenger watchdogs effective in representing passenger interests in public transport  in recent years  concerns over effective consumer representation of public transport users have increased considerably  as public transport has undergone substantial regulatory reforms  the ultimate goal of deregulation is to protect and benefit the public at large  hence  this paper explores how this goal is being pursued by examining the roles of statutory  independent passenger watchdogs and their relationships with authorities and operators in regulated and deregulated bus regimes  drawing on a case study of london travelwatch and transport focus in great britain  our findings show that statutory passenger watchdogs are effective in representing passenger interests due to four factors in particular  the organizational setting  research based evidence  accommodating relationships  and public outreach  the paper also documents the differences in how these passenger watchdogs build their relationships with key stakeholders and work with them within the strategic tactical operational framework  
 are users better off with new transit lines  this paper studies the entry of a new competitor in a public transport network  competitors for existing rail can be long distance buses but also the vanpool services  these new lines decrease the ridership of the existing lines and increase waiting time for its passengers  a stylized network model is used to study this potential vicious cycle  we derive sufficient conditions for this negative effect to increase overall public transport costs  the new line is only beneficial when there are relatively many users that want to use the new direct line or when the unit cost reduction is sufficiently large  our result raises concerns with respect to the decentralized management of transit systems   c  2017 elsevier ltd  all rights reserved  
 area level socio economic disparities in active and sedentary transport  investigating the role of population density in australia physical inactivity is considered as a key factor that contributes to socio economic inequalities in health  a persistent problem in our society  living in areas of lower socio economic status  ses  is known to be associated with lower levels of leisure time physical activity  however  research examining the relationship between area level ses and transport related physical activity has reported mixed findings  this may be due to the presence of sub groups in which differential associations between transport behaviours and ses exist  this cross sectional study examined associations of area level ses with active and sedentary transport behaviours  and whether population density moderates the associations  data from two household surveys conducted in australia  south east queensland  melbourne  were used  participants  35 283 adults  aged 18 64 years  reported their travel behaviours using a 24 hr travel diary  they were categorised according to the level of walking  active transport   public transport use  active transport   and car use  sedentary transport   overall  we found that living in lower ses areas was associated with lower likelihood of walking  public transport use  and prolonged car use  however  stratified analyses found that the associations of area level ses with active and sedentary transport behaviours varied between areas with different levels of population density  our findings suggest that residents of low ses  high density areas in australia are particularly at risk of being physically inactive for daily travel  less walking  less public transport use  and longer car use   given that travel behaviours tend to be habitual  preventive actions may be needed to  promote active transport and to reduce the risk of chronic diseases for this sub group  interdisciplinary research involving the public health  transport  and planning sectors can inform the development of policy initiatives to facilitate active transport  
 arrive in time by train with high probability very often  a train passenger must meet a deadline at the destination  for example  to catch a plane or to arrive at an important meeting on time  train delays and broken connections let the passenger arrive later than scheduled  events of this kind are usually not foreseeable before the journey commences  to be on the safe side  a connection should be prebooked such that  in case the connection breaks anywhere  alternative continuations guarantee arrival prior to the deadline with acceptably high probability  for busy people  the challenge is to commence the journey as late as possible  provided the risk of failing to meet the deadline is negligible  this scenario translates into the problem to find the latest connection plus alternative continuations such that the probability of meeting the deadline is not lower than a given required probability of success  close to 100    we present a dynamic programming approach to this optimization problem and report on an empirical study based on comprehensive real world data from deutsche bahn ag  the german national railways company  our algorithm efficiently computes optimal results  
 arterial signal coordination with uneven double cycling in arterial coordination  high traffic volume at large intersections often requires a long cycle length to achieve good two way progression  this long cycle length  however  often causes excessive delay at some minor intersections where the traffic volume is low on cross streets  this paper describes optimization models developed to enable uneven double cycling  udc  in arterial signal coordination to address this issue  the control scheme adopts udc at some of the minor intersections where a background cycle has two sub cycles of different lengths  two multi objective udc models are developed  the basic udc model maximizes constant two way bandwidths and minimizes average delay of through traffic on cross streets at udc intersections  this model is then improved by maximizing variable bandwidth and considering pedestrian needs  the resultant models are a mixed integer quadratic programming  miqp  problem  results of numerical experiments and case study simulations indicate that the udc control scheme can greatly reduce delay at udc intersections without affecting progression quality of arterial through traffic  preliminary guidelines are also provided for udc implementation   c  2017 elsevier ltd  all rights reserved  
 assessing core periphery relation through travel patterns   the case of israel there is an urgent need for understanding the processes through which investments in transport infrastructure modify the economic geography landscape of a region or country  the  new economic geography   neg  suggests that the concentration of economic activities is determined by  centripetal  and  centrifugal  forces which in turn determine the balance between the economic and geographical core and periphery regions  transport can  and should be  understood as the balancing factor between these forces  in order to take a snapshot of core periphery relation in a country  travel patterns between centre and periphery in israel in 2007 are analysed using mobile phone signal tracking  results show that despite israel being a very small country the level of inter regional travel as a proportion of overall travel is small  furthermore  despite the clear economic core in israel  the metropolitan area of tel aviv   the periphery regions seem to remain independent  yet  analysis of the inter regional travel that does take place suggests a greater dependence of  travel from  the periphery to the centre than vice versa  this in turn suggests that investments in more long distance transport infrastructure in israel would further increase the dependency of the periphery on the centre and could increase core periphery disparities   c  2017 elsevier ltd  all rights reserved  
 assessing drivers  response during automated driver support system failures with non driving tasks introduction  with the increase in automated driver support systems  drivers are shifting from operating their vehicles to supervising their automation  as a result  it is important to understand how drivers interact with these automated systems and evaluate their effect on driver responses to safety critical events  this study aimed to identify how drivers responded when experiencing a safety critical event in automated vehicles while also engaged in non driving tasks  method  in total 48 participants were included in this driving simulator study with two levels of automated driving   a  driving with no automation and  b  driving with adaptive cruise control  acc  and lane keeping  lk  systems engaged  and also two levels of a non driving task  a  watching a movie or  b  no non driving task  in addition to driving performance measures  non driving task performance and the mean glance duration for the non driving task were compared between the two levels of automated driving  results  drivers using the automated systems responded worse than those manually driving in terms of reaction time  lane departure duration  and maximum steering wheel angle to an induced lane departure event  these results also found that non driving tasks further impaired driver responses to a safety critical event in the automated system condition  conclusion  in the automated driving condition  driver responses to the safety critical events were slower  especially when engaged in a non driving task  practical application  traditional driver performance variables may not necessarily effectively and accurately evaluate driver responses to events when supervising autonomous vehicle systems  thus  it is important to develop and use appropriate variables to quantify drivers  performance under these conditions   c  2017 national safety council and elsevier ltd  all rights reserved  
 assessing strategies for protecting transportation infrastructure from an uncertain climate future this paper investigates the importance of explicitly considering the stochastic nature of future climate impact predictions and predictive accuracy for optimal investment planning in the protection of coastal and inland transportation infrastructure against climate impacts  such impacts include sea level rise  coastal and riverine flooding resulting from more frequent and intense precipitation events  storms  storm surges and other extreme events  for this purpose  numerical experiments utilizing stochastic optimization based methodologies were conducted on a case study of the washington  d c  greater metropolitan area proximate to the potomac river under varying climatic predictions  results from the numerical experiments suggest a 54  reduction in added costs due to the implementation of chosen protective infrastructure investments  they also indicate a reduction in added costs  capital investment and added delays  on the order of 19  when the investments are chosen to hedge against probable future flooding events as compared with planning for the 50th percentile slr prediction with associated weather events  a potential gain of nearly 27  in reduced costs through improved predictive accuracy in climatic forecasts is also noted  suggesting significant value in more accurate forecasts  
 assessing the cost optimal mileage of medium duty electric vehicles with a numeric simulation approach electric freight vehicles have the potential to mitigate local urban road freight transport emissions  but their numbers are still insignificant  logistics companies often consider electric vehicles as too costly compared to vehicles powered by combustion engines  research within the body of the current literature suggests that increasing the driven mileage can enhance the competitiveness of electric freight vehicles  in this paper we develop a numeric simulation approach to analyze the cost optimal balance between a high utilization of medium duty electric vehicles which often have low operational costs and the common requirement that their batteries will need expensive replacements  our work relies on empirical findings of the real world energy consumption from a large german field test with medium duty electric vehicles  our results suggest that increasing the range to the technical maximum by intermediate  quick  charging and multi shift usage is not the most cost efficient strategy in every case  a low daily mileage is more cost efficient at high energy prices or consumptions  relative to diesel prices or consumptions  or if the battery is not safeguarded by a long warranty  in practical applications our model may help companies to choose the most suitable electric vehicle for the application purpose or the optimal trip length from a given set of options  for policymakers  our analysis provides insights on the relevant parameters that may either reduce the cost gap at lower daily mileages  or increase the utilization of medium duty electric vehicles  in order to abate the negative impact of urban road freight transport on the environment  
 assessing the effects of a growing electric vehicle fleet using a microscopic travel demand model the german government seeks to increase the number of electric vehicles  ev  in the german car fleet to one million by 2020  since some characteristics of evs differ from conventional cars  there is an increasing need to assess the various impacts of a growing ev fleet  in this work  we have focused on possible effects related to the field of transport  we identified three important aspects and evaluated them over a period of one week using the microscopic travel demand model mo bitopp  first  we modelled the potential ev user groups of the near future by developing an ev user model  this model considers both interest in evs and suitability for ev usage  second  we simulated the travel behaviour of ev users  we used an ev usage model to consider the restrictions of evs in choice decisions and also compared the usage behaviour of ev and conventional cars users  third  we analysed the power consumption of the simulated evs and evaluated the load peaks based on the simulated travel patterns  our results indicate that a growing ev fleet implies a more heterogeneous distribution of evs among car owners  they also indicate that the trip chain length of battery electric vehicles  bevs  is much lower than that of extended range electric vehicles  erevs  and conventional cars on average  
 assessing the impact of closely spaced intersections on traffic operations and pollutant emissions on a corridor level traffic lights or roundabouts along corridors are usually installed to address location specific operational needs  an understanding of the impacts on traffic regarding to highly congested closely spaced intersections has not been fully addressed  accordingly  consideration should be given to how these specific segments affect corridor performance as a whole  one mixed roundabout traffic light stop controlled junctions corridor was evaluated with the microscopic traffic model  vissim  and emissions methodology  vehicle specific power   vsp   the analysis was focused on two major intersections of the corridor  a roundabout and a traffic light spaced lower than 170 m apart under different traffic demand levels  the traffic data and corridor geometry were coded into vissim and compared with an alternative scenario where the traffic light was replaced by a single lane roundabout  this research also tested a method to improve corridor performance and emissions by examining the integrated effect of the spacing between these intersections on traffic delay and vehicular emissions  carbon dioxide  monoxide carbon  nitrogen oxides  and hydrocarbons   the fast non dominated sorting genetic algorithm  nsga ii  was used to find the optimal spacing for these intersections  the analysis showed that the roundabout could achieve lower queue length  similar to 64   and emissions  16 27   depending on the pollutant  than the traffic light  the results also suggested that 200 m of spacing using the best traffic control would provide a moderate advantage in traffic operations and emissions as compared with the existing spacing   c  2017 elsevier ltd  all rights reserved  
 assessing the impact of speed limit reduction near signalized high speed intersections equipped with advance warning flashers an advance warning flasher alerts drivers of the imminent onset of a yellow light at a signalized intersection  and it is widely used to reduce crash frequency and severity  recently  a more aggressive countermeasure  a speed limit reduction  is being used at high speed signalized intersections in addition to advance warning flashers  in this paper  six high speed intersection approaches in nebraska were evaluated to assess the operational effects of no speed limit reduction  an 8 0 km h  5 mi h  speed limit reduction  and a 16 1 km h  10 mi h  speed limit reduction in the vicinity of high speed signalized intersections equipped with advance warning flashers  the placement of speed limit reduction signs resulted in significant reductions in observed speeds only when upstream drivers were traveling at speeds higher than a comfortable range 1 8 to 4 0 km h  1 1 to 2 5 mi h  higher than the regulatory speed limit  the likelihood of this condition being satisfied was higher in case of 16 1 km h  10 mi h  drop  however  it was not found to be true when the speed limit was dropped by 8 0 km h  5 mi h   also  the compliance rates to the regulatory speed limit varied from 15 to 85   highlighting the fact that ambient conditions have a much greater influence on drivers  speed choices as compared to the regulatory speed limit  this research provides further evidence that speed limit reductions  in conjunction with advance warning flashers  appears to be an effective safety countermeasure  however  their effects will be dependent on the amount of speed limit reduction and observed speeds   c  2017 american society of civil engineers

 auction based tolling systems in a connected and automated vehicles environment  public opinion and implications for toll revenue and capacity utilization autonomous and connected vehicles are expected to enable new tolling mechanisms  such as auction based tolls  for allocating the limited roadway capacity  this research examines the public perception of futuristic auction based tolling systems  with a focus on the public acceptance of such systems over current tolling practices on highways  e g   dynamic and fixed tolling methodologies   through a stated preference survey  responses from 159 road users residing in virginia are elicited to understand route choice behavior under a descending price auction implemented on a hypothetical two route network  analysis of the survey data shows that there is no outright rejection of the presented auction based tolling among those who are familiar with the current tolling methods  while males strongly support the new method  no clear pattern emerges among other demographic variables such as income and education level  and age  while high income respondents and regular commuters are more likely to pay higher tolls  no statistical significance between different genders  age groups  household sizes  and education levels is found  based on the modeling results and the hypothetical road network  it is found that descending price tolling method yields higher average toll rates  and generates at least 70  more revenue when travel time saving is 30 min  and improves capacity utilization of the toll road significantly compared to fixed tolls   c  2017 elsevier ltd  all rights reserved  
 automated vehicles and behavioural adaptation in canada the current tests of automated vehicles  avs  with human back up drivers and opt into a self driving car raise important questions regarding public awareness of the limitations of these vehicles  road safety can be greatly improved by focusing on the often overlooked intersection between driver behaviour and the use of new technologies  this paper presents the extent to which canadian drivers self reported how they would adapt their behaviour if using limited self driving vehicles  lsdvs   an online survey and focus groups were conducted to explore the knowledge  attitudes  perceptions and behaviours of canadians in relation to avs  it was found that many drivers believed they would not need to pay attention to the road environment when using lsdvs  and that some of them would modify or adapt their behaviour in negative ways that would undermine safety objectives  these results provide insight useful to shape educational strategies  government policies  and tactics to help ensure the safety benefits that are highly expected of avs actually materialize  
 automobile dependence and physical inactivity  insights from the california household travel survey background  auto dependence has been linked to the physical inactivity epidemic across u s  cities  resulting in unprecedented increases in incidences of obesity  cardiovascular diseases  depression  etc  the search for strategies to pull an overwhelming majority of auto dependents out of their sedentary lifestyles by encouraging them to use transit  walk and  bike continues to challenge planners and policy makers  methods  we use the 2012 13 california household travel survey data for analyzing the auto dependence and physical inactivity connection  we select a sample of employed individuals with access to car in urban california  and classify them as discretionary transit riders  n 390   active auto dependents  n 1287   or sedentary auto dependents  n 8754  based on their self reported travel mode use and time spent in physical activity over a 24 h period  we investigate factors that are associated with significantly high physical activity among some auto dependents relative to the sedentary majority  we also revisit the transit physical activity connection  and explore conditions that make transit use unfeasible for some active auto dependents  results  discretionary transit use is associated with higher physical activity  however  there is large variation in physical activity within auto dependents  significantly higher physical activity is associated with factors such as higher income  flexible work schedule  shorter work hours  and mixed land use  kids  inflexibility of work schedule  low residential density  lack of pedestrian and bicycling friendly street design  and long distance to transit stops prohibit otherwise active auto dependents from choosing transit  employment sector influences both physical activity and choice of transit  conclusion  to get sedentary auto dependents out of endemic physical inactivity  our research indicates the need for targeting lower incomes  incentivizing employers to provide flexible work hours  and to continue dense  mixed use developments that make active travel feasible  in addition  to get active auto dependents to use transit  transit managers must focus on retaining immigrant riders and non hispanic asians  and attracting people with children  
 automobile dependency as a barrier to vision zero  evidence from the states in the usa with a traffic fatality rate of 10 6 per 100 000 as of 2013 more than triple that in the uk  the netherlands  and sweden the united states has the worst traffic safety performance of all developed countries  statewide variations are even more pronounced  north dakota registers more than twice the national average and five times the rate of massachusetts  we used panel models and annual data from 1997 to 2013 to capture the effect of seven separate sets of factors that influence traffic safety  exposure  travel behavior  socioeconomics  macroeconomics  safety policies  and mitigating factors such as health care  the results of our panel models and supplementary analysis of state effects show that two variables vehicle miles traveled and vehicles per capita have the strongest impact on traffic fatality rates  this is closely followed by infant mortality rates  the proxy that we used to represent the quality of health care  policy levers such as graduated driver s licenses  gdl  have improved safety  but to a limited extent  we also found that states with higher urban density and more walking are associated with lower traffic fatality rates  taken as a whole  our findings suggest that if additional progress is to be made in reducing traffic fatalities  emphasis needs to move beyond simply focusing on policies such as gdl and seat belt laws  which have already been adopted by almost all jurisdictions across the united states  we need to also consider factors that focus on the type of urban form that we are creating to ensure that we are fostering environments that encourage multi modal transportation such as walking to reduce the vmt and vehicles per capita  the two strongest predictors of traffic fatalities  
 autonomous vehicles  developing a public health research agenda to frame the future of transportation policy recent advancements in autonomous vehicle technology have led to projections that fully autonomous vehicles could define the transportation network within the coming years  in preparation for this disruptive innovation in transportation technology  transportation scholars have started to assess the potential impacts of autonomous vehicles  and transportation policymakers have started to formulate policy recommendations and regulatory guidance concerning their deployment  however  there has been little analysis of the public health implications arising from the widespread adoption of fully autonomous vehicles  we examine these prospective public health impacts both benefits and harms to individual and population health and analyze how they can be considered in the development of transportation policy  in this manuscript  we discuss the evolving relationship between technological innovations in transportation and public health  conceptualize automated transportation as a disruptive technology necessitating a public policy response  and define a research agenda to examine the public health implications of autonomous vehicle policy  as seen through existing evidence on road casualties  environmental health  aging populations  non communicable disease  land use  and labor markets  we conclude that such a public health research agenda would provide a basis to frame autonomous vehicle policies that best support the public s health  realize the united nations sustainable development goals to ensure healthy lives and create sustainable cities  and provide a basis for public health participation in transportation policy reforms  
 autonomous vehicles  the next jump in accessibilities  autonomous vehicles are expected to offer a higher comfort of traveling at lower prices and at the same time to increase road capacity   a pattern recalling the rise of the private car and later of motorway construction  using the swiss national transport model  this research simulates the impact of autonomous vehicles on accessibility of the swiss municipalities  the results show that autonomous vehicles could cause another quantum leap in accessibility  moreover  the spatial distribution of the accessibility impacts implies that autonomous vehicles favor urban sprawl and may render public transport superfluous except for dense urban areas   c  2017 elsevier ltd  all rights reserved  
 availability and consistency of health and non health data for road traffic fatality  analysis of data from 195 countries  1985 2013 high quality data are critical for validly monitoring progress toward global initiatives related to road traffic crash prevention  we assessed the availability and consistency of road traffic mortality data from health and non health departments in national governments  plus changes in data consistency over time from 1985 to 2013  using freely accessible data  we systematically assessed availability and consistency of health and non health data from 1985 to 2013 in 195 countries  data availability was reflected by the presence of data on motor vehicle mortality rates in that country at any points between 1985 and 2013  the ratio of  health data divided by non health data  was calculated to measure the consistency of the two types of data sources  we found that 77 of the 195 countries in the world  39   had both health and non health data sources available from 1985 to 2013  none of the 34 low income countries had both kinds of data sources simultaneously available  while 41 of 55 high income countries had both kinds of data sources  of the 71 countries having both kinds of data for five years or more  33 countries demonstrated high consistency between data sources  25 countries showed moderate data consistency  and 13 countries displayed low consistency  jamaica  mexico  and china had the largest data inconsistencies  26 of the 71 countries witnessed improved data consistency between 1985 and 2013  but nine experienced decreasing data consistency  in a few cases to a large degree  efforts are needed to identify reasons leading to data quality changes  and to develop approaches to improve data quality in those nations where it is inadequate

 barriers to coastal shipping development  an indian perspective coastal shipping has been widely recognised as a sustainable and efficient alternative to road transport  however  the barriers encountered in the industry have not been systematically studied in any region  from an indian perspective  this study aims to prioritise barriers to coastal shipping development for effective policy interventions  it identifies important barriers through a delphi study and then quantifies their cause and effect relationships by the decision making trial and evaluation laboratory analysis  dematel  technique  it is interesting that the main barriers  those have most impact on coastal shipping development  are not necessarily the ones most widely recognised  the study also uncovers the hidden cause and effect relationships between several barriers  four main barriers are identified   1  indian maritime legislation  especially cabotage rules    2  issues in the infrastructure and procedures at port and port centric areas   3  underdevelopment of small ports   4  lack of a collaborative culture among the various service providers involved in the logistics supply chain  this study finally recommends relaxing cabotage rules to stimulate the inflow of foreign capital to grow coastal shipping  improving the current port system through joint efforts of the ports  indian customs and government  and fostering supply chain collaboration   c  2017 elsevier ltd  all rights reserved  
 barriers to supply chain integration in the maritime logistics industry supply chain integration  sci  is a management philosophy that centres on intra  and inter  firm coordination and collaboration  the aim of this study is to identify and discuss the underlying barriers that inhibit sci in the maritime logistics industry  a list of barriers was identified from literature and interviews  subsequently  surveys on the barriers were administered on 172 container shipping firms  from exploratory factor analysis  the results suggest that the extensive barriers can be parsimoniously represented by five factors  the first factor relates to the lack of trust and commitment because of the display of scepticism and opportunistic behaviour  the second factor is related to resistance to change which is a result of complacency and individualism  the third factor corresponds to the incompatibility of operating and strategic goals  which is caused by inadequate supply chain leadership and poor partner selection  the fourth factor pertains to the lack of resources  this issue is pertinent to small firms and those operating in numerous parallel logistics chains  finally  the last factor relates to measurement failure  the inability to accurately measure and assign cost to the activities that are necessary for the completion of a maritime logistics service prevents the equitable distribution of rewards  which is a critical success factor for sci  
 battery degradation and behaviour for electric vehicles  review and numerical analyses of several models the use of electric vehicles for goods distribution opens up a wide range of research problems  battery electric vehicles  bevs  operate on batteries that have a limited life  as well as specific charging and discharging patterns which need to be considered in the context of their use for goods distribution  while many transportation problems associated with the integration of freight electric vehicles in distribution management problems have been investigated  there is room for further research on specifically how to model battery degradation and behaviour in such problems  the aim of this paper is to provide tractable models for transportation scientists that will allow predicting the lifetime degradation and instantaneous charging and discharging behaviour of bev batteries   c  2017 elsevier ltd  all rights reserved  
 behavioral analysis of airline scheduled block time adjustment scheduled block time  sbt  is the time between gate departure and gate arrival assumed by airlines for use in published timetables and operations planning  sbt setting has critical impacts on airlines  operating cost and on time performance  air carriers regularly update their sbts to respond to changing operating conditions and evolving business strategies  most existing studies have focused on investigating the impact of sbt on on time performance or predicting sbt based on historical performance and market characteristics  however  the dynamics of adjusting sbt  which may allow deeper understanding about the trade offs airlines make between sbt and on time performance  have been rarely studied  in this paper  we assume that sbt adjustment choices reveal preferences  basecton airlines  practice in setting sbt  hypothetical sbt scenarios and their corresponding on time performance profiles are re constructed to mimic the situations faced by airline schedulers  this enables us to infer how airlines trade off between sbt  on time arrivals  and earliness  by using correlated mixed logit models  we find that our five study airlines are willing to increase sbt from 0 38 to 0 54 min to increase on time performance by 1   we also find that both on time performance and early arrival are valued by airlines  but the former is considerably more valuable  the estimated models can also be used to predict airlines  sbt adjustments in response to changes in operational performance   c  2017 elsevier ltd  all rights reserved  
 behavioural and organisational interventions to prevent trespass and graffiti vandalism on railway property trespassing behaviour is a problem for railway operations because it leads to train pedestrian collisions and important delays  trespassing incidents result from the violation of the rail track access rules by pedestrians  in many cases  this behaviour is driven by vandalism intentions  various measures have been developed and implemented to reduce trespass and vandalism on railway premises  but to date there is no publication to show which of these measures are more effective  this paper aims to review the good practices and recommendations on the prevention of railway trespass and vandalism and to provide a summary of the most promising preventive measures that involve human factors namely collaborative measures  enforcement  staff training  public education and environmental measures  which are likely to influence people s behaviour  physical measures  e g  fencing  and purely technical ones  e g  detection systems  are not within the scope of this paper  since there is consistent literature indicating the effectiveness of these interventions  the method included a systematic review of the literature on the topic  as well as a collection of prevention practices from the railway operating community  both the procedures were conducted during the eu funded projects restrail  reduction of suicides and trespasses on the railway property  and graffolution  awareness and prevention solutions against graffiti vandalism in public areas and transport   although the results reveal promising preventive measures  very few studies show evidence for their effectiveness  we discuss how measures can be combined to increase their efficiency for trespass and vandalism prevention in the background of a behavioural theoretical framework applied to the rail context  
 benchmarking operational efficiency of port terminals using the oee indicator the operational data of port terminals is often evaluated by operators and scholars  with the purposes of finding characteristics that lead to superior performance  or identifying the most efficient terminal in a sample  however  most authors and analysts use methodologies that do not allow distinguishing between manageable and unmanageable   exogenous  factors  thus often leading to ambiguous results and making the definition of targets a difficult task  this article proposes a methodology to overcome this limitation  based on the breakdown of the high level overall equipment effectiveness indicator into a set of indicators  each addressing either manageable or unmanageable factors  based on this set it is possible to define achievable efficiency targets for each terminal  considering the unique constraints affecting each one  
 benefit cost analysis of lane departure warning and roll stability control in commercial vehicles introduction  this paper presents the cost benefits of two different onboard safety systems  oss  installed on trucks as they operated during normal revenue deliveries  using a formal economic analysis approach  the study quantified the costs and benefits associated with lane departure warning  ldw  systems and roll stability control  rsc  systems  methods  the study used data collected from participating carriers  many of these crashes were not reported to state or federal agencies   and the research team also reviewed each crash file to determine if the specific oss would have mitigated or prevented the crash  the deployment of each oss was anticipated to increase the safety of all road users  but impact different sectors of society in different ways  benefits that were inherent in each group  e g   industry  society  were considered  and different benefit cost analyses  bcas  were performed  results  this paper presents two bcas  a bca focused on the costs and benefits in the carrier industry by implementing each oss  and a bca that measured the societal benefits of each oss  in addition  a bca for a theoretical mandatory deployment option for each oss is presented  conclusions  bca results for ldw and rsc clearly showed their benefits outweighed their costs for the carrier and society  practical applications  cost information is a crucial factor in purchasing decisions in carriers  similarly  regulators must consider the cost burden prior to mandating technologies  the results in this study provide carrier decision makers and regulators with information necessary to make an informed decision regarding rsc and ldw   c  2017 national safety council and elsevier ltd  all rights reserved  
 benefits of horizontal cooperation in dial a ride services dial a ride services provide collective on demand transportation  usually tailored to the needs of people with reduced mobility  this paper investigates the operational effects of horizontal cooperation among dial a ride providers  the current practice is that users choose a particular provider to submit their requests  providers operating in the same area create their routing solutions independently of each other  given their own set of customers  in contrast  horizontal cooperation through joint route planning implies that customer requests can be exchanged among providers in order to minimize the overall routing cost  in addition to quantifying the operational benefits generated by such a horizontal cooperation  this paper identifies operational characteristics that influence the magnitude of the savings  a real life case study reveals the reasons why providers benefit from certain request exchanges  as well as the extent to which these exchanges are predictable in advance  the solutions are obtained using a large neighborhood search algorithm that performs well on benchmark data   c  2017 elsevier ltd  all rights reserved  
 benign mobility  electric bicycles  sustainable transport consumption behaviour and socio technical transitions in nanjing  china in this paper  we ask whether electric bicycle  e bike  use in urban china is a temporary phase or an embedded form of sustainable mobility  a survey was conducted in nanjing in order to assess the characteristics and attitudes of electric bicycle users and other mode users  e g  pedestrians  car drivers   based on over 1000 responses a logit model was used to analyse current and future mode choice  the results show that electric bicycles are not necessarily displacing cars on a substantial scale  but are rather displacing the  benign  modes of walking  traditional bicycling  and using the bus  we conclude that electric bicycles are helping to enable mobility dependent lifestyles that may in the future be supported by cars  rather than offering a true departure from carbon centred  motorized forms of transport   c  2017 elsevier ltd  all rights reserved  
 bergen light rail   effects on travel behaviour bergen is the second most populous city in norway  280 000 inhabitants  and is situated along the west coast of the country  in 2010  the city reintroduced tram service with the opening of a new light rail line  after a gap of 45 years  this study documents the increase in public transit use in bergen  both in terms of volume and market share  since the line was opened  furthermore  it explores the effects of light rail transit on travel behaviour using bergen as a case city  these goals are accomplished by combining and analysing data from different sources  including five travel surveys  and other data concerning building stock  population  business activity  commuting and traffic counts  the study identifies four potential driving forces for changes in travel behaviour   1  the introduction of the light rail   2  a new high frequency bus network   3  increased rates in the toll cordon system  and  4  changes in the urban structure  the study concluded that the introduction of light rail was the main driving force behind the growth in public transit use  the study also highlighted that transit use was highest in areas served by the light rail  the effects of the light rail investments are reinforced by an optimal location of the line with respect to potential users  
 beyond cost benefit analysis  the search for a comprehensive evaluation of transport investment major advances have been made in trying to go beyond the conventional cost benefit analysis appraisal of major transport projects that focus almost entirely on user benefits  whilst newer methods to estimate the potential for agglomeration impacts in an imperfectly competitive world have become more mainstream there is still a desire to be able to capture more robustly the even more transformational impacts that are often claimed to result from major projects  this paper reviews some of these approaches and discusses how they have been used in some projects in the united kingdom  it concludes that there is still scope for further improvement but that the desire of policy makers for precise estimates may have to be modified   c  2017 elsevier ltd  all rights reserved  
 beyond the threat of legal sanctions  what deters speeding behaviours  the effectiveness of countermeasures to reduce the incidence of speeding is extremely important when considering the impact the behaviour has on the road toll  deterrence based sanctions such as fines and licence loss are heavily utilised to deter drivers from exceeding the speed limit as well as emphasising the threat of physical harm  e g   media campaigns   however  surprisingly little research has actually examined the extent to which legal and non legal sanctions influence speeding behaviours  this paper reports on an examination of 1253 queensland drivers  perceptions of legal and non legal speeding sanctions and the corresponding deterrent impact of such perceptions on self reported offending behaviour  participants volunteered to complete either an online or paper version of the questionnaire  the self reported frequency of speeding behaviours was consistent with previous research  as was the significant link found between speeding and being a younger male with greater exposure to the road  encouragingly  perceptions of apprehension certainty were not only the highest rated factor  but were also found to be a predictor of avoiding speeding behaviours  however  an expected link between perceptual severity and offending was counterintuitive in nature  e g   positive  and participants generally did not consider penalties were applied swiftly  fearing being injured was the only non legal sanction predictive of reduced speeding behaviours  as the threat of social sanction or internal loss  e g   shame  had a limited impact while researchers have long proposed that a range of legal and non legal sanctions can influence speeding behaviours  which are also utilised in complementary media campaigns   a strong link between deterrent forces and offending behaviours with self reported data remains lacking  this paper further considers the findings in regards to the need for further research   c  2017 elsevier ltd  all rights reserved  
 bicycle helmet use patterns in italy  a description and analysis of survey data from an italian friends of cycling association cycling is becoming one of the most popular forms of recreation and transport the world over  but cyclists still have a high level of vulnerability  a bicycle helmet is an important safety device available to cyclists  but little is known regarding possible determinants of helmet use among adults  this study aims at providing information on helmet usage patterns in italy and identifying the factors associated with bicycle helmet use  data on 2072 bicycle riders from an italian friends of cycling association aged 18 years or older who had ridden a bicycle in the last month were collected using an ad hoc questionnaire via the web  the sample was equally distributed among subjects who always  most of the time  sometimes  rarely  or never use a helmet  to evaluate the association among socio demographic and bicycle use characteristics and helmet use  a multinomial logistic regression model was performed  the results show a higher propensity to use a helmet among males  riders coming from central and southern italy  people who cycles more than 60 kilometres in a week  cyclists who have already had a crash  people who do not cycle daily or almost daily  riders of sport bikes  moreover  the propensity to use a helmet increases with age  the survey provided a first step in approaching the lack of data on cycling behaviour and the wearing of a helmet in italy  
 bicycle mode share in china  a city level analysis of long term trends in the past 15 years  cities in china have experienced big changes in socioeconomic and traffic conditions  resulting in a long term change in bicycle use  this study aims to quantify the changes in bicycle mode share in chinese cities and explore the potential causes  based on data from 51 cities  it is found that bicycle mode share at the city level decreased gradually in the past  conventional bicycle mode share decreased with a rate of 3   per year  but electric bicycle mode share increased with a rate of 2   per year  the correlations between city features such as demographics and built environments and bicycle mode share at different city sizes are compared  the generalized linear models are estimated to relate the changes in the share of different trip modes to various city level factors  the results show that the bicycle mode share in a city is impacted by factors including city area size  population density  number of cars  percentage of local road mileage among all roads  and trip purpose  possible reasons for the changes in bicycle uses in chinese cities are explored and policy implications are discussed  
 bicycle sharing system  success  determinants many municipalities assert bicycle sharing systems  bss  as having many benefits  justifying their adoption  yet few explicitly state the purpose of their system making comparison or determination of success impossible  in addition  the apprehension of many bss operators to share data further hinders comparison  this paper estimates the number of daily trips from publicly available data for 75 bss case studies across the world and provides trips per bike per day scores as a comparison of performance and success  results reveal that a third of case studies have fewer than the psychologically important one trip per bicycle per day  to ascertain what factors are associated with this metric we estimate models with independent variables related to system attributes  station density  weather  geography and transportation infrastructure  our analysis provides strong evidence undermining the  network effect  promoted by influential bss policy makers that expanding system size increases performance  finally our results describe and discuss causal variables associated with higher bss performance   c  2017 elsevier ltd  all rights reserved  
 bicycle metro integration in a growing city  the determinants of cycling as a transfer mode in metro station areas in beijing bicycle transit integration  in which cycling is used to as a transfer mode to from transit station is widely believed to be one very important way of promoting a transit city and achieving efficient and sustainable urban transport systems  however  the empirical evidence for the determinants of people s choices to transfer by bicycle as a travel mode remain largely unstudied  this paper investigates this issue  using beijing and its metro system as a case study  using a multilevel logistic model  we found that travel distance is the most important influence on rates of cycling for transfer trips between metro stations and home or workplace  there were also socioeconomic influences  with young people being less likely to cycle and more likely to use buses  middle  and high income earners were more likely to drive than cycle  while low income earners were more likely to take the bus  personal attitudes are also influential those who prefer cheap travel were more likely to cycle  above results suggest that the increasing city size and urban expansion are great challenges to cycling systems in growing cities  the presence of bicycle sharing programs  mixed land use  and green parks in metro station areas were associated with greater rates of cycling transfer  in order to promote bicycle and ride schemes in metro station areas  education initiatives designed to influence behavior should be integrated with investment in bicycle infrastructure   c  2017 elsevier ltd  all rights reserved  
 bicycle vehicle interactions at mid sections of mixed traffic streets  examining passing distance and bicycle comfort perception this paper studies the relevant factors in mixed urban traffic that may impact the lateral spacing between bicycles and vehicles  passing distance  pd   and their resulting effect on a bicyclists  comfort based on a study of six sites in ottawa  canada  the observations are   i  the average position of bicycles from the curb is 0 57 m  and lesser  le  0 35 m  in the presence of parking   ii  90  of passes exceed 1 23 m   iii  pd is positively correlated with motor vehicle speed  lane width  and bicycle position from adjacent curb edge line  whiles inversely correlated to ambient traffic density and bicycle speed   iv  motor vehicle speed has the highest prediction of pd variability   v  pd and ambient traffic density  atd  are found to be the most important factors to a bicyclists  comfort perception  bcp   two linear regression models for pd and bcp were developed and significant variables are identified as  motor vehicle speed  bicycle speed  atd  number of lanes  and lane width  the presence or absence of a grade slope is found to be significant to the pd model and not to bcp  the models both exhibit limited predictive ability  however residual plots and significance of included variables are indicative of correct assumptions for the models  it is recommended that speed calming  sharrows  road signs instructing road sharing  and educating road users against  dooring  crashes be considered in improving road sharing  especially for narrow lanes  i e  less than 3 6 m  and lanes wider than 4 5 m  it is also prudent for designers to avoid installing parking zones on narrow shared roads  
 bicycling frequency  a study of preferences and travel behavior in salt lake city  utah improving our understanding of cycling behaviors in urban areas is an important step in producing a more sustainable transportation system  based on a hybrid stated and revealed preference survey  n   132  in salt lake city  utah  this paper studies the influence of attitudes and demographics on cycling frequency  a factor analysis of stated preferences shows the existence of four attitudinal factors concerning bicycling  safety  direct benefits  comfort  and timesaving  in turn  these are used in a multivariate model of cycling frequency and the decision to cycle is found to be positively correlated with the timesaving and convenience factors  and negatively correlated with preferences for travel comfort  our results provide a broader empirical base for the complex relationships between attitudes  demographics and travel behaviors and point to some policy recommendations for increasing cycling uptake in the region   c  2017 elsevier ltd  all rights reserved  
 bicyclists  preferences for route characteristics and crowding in copenhagen   a choice experiment study of commuters cycling as a mode of transportation is increasingly being advocated due to the many positive effects it has on people s health  the environment and to counteract increasing congestion on the transportation infrastructure  there is a long tradition of using cycling as a mode of transportation among the danish public and this is widespread across people with different socio demographic characteristics  copenhagen has an extensive network of cycling facilities and is often used as a role model for other large cities when developing cycling facilities  this setting provides a unique basis for investigating bicycle commuters  preferences for route characteristics and crowding in particular  which is not studied before  but likely to become an issue around the world s cities with increases in number of bicyclists  the study is based on a choice experiment of 3891 active cyclists in copenhagen  the investigated attributes are cycle track  crowding  stops  environment road type  green surroundings  and travel distance which is used as a payment vehicle to gain more desirable route characteristics  on average people state that they are willing to cycle 1 84 km longer if the route has a designated cycle track  and 0 8 km more if there are green surroundings too  stops and crowding  based on number of cyclists on the route  have significant negative impacts on people s utility of a given route  people were willing to cycle one kilometre longer to avoid high levels of crowding and approximately 1 3 km longer to avoid routes with many stops  the most attractive road environment is a segregated path only for cyclists closely followed by shopping street  looking into heterogeneity  we find that people who own a car have less disutility of cycling additional distance  the results may support future decision making when creating new infrastructure for cycling in cities by addressing the perceived importance of facilities and crowding in a population where commute cycling is very widespread   c  2017 elsevier ltd  all rights reserved  
 bike share in the australian city  assessing the feasibility of a future bike share program for adelaide this paper describes the process of accessing the suitability of a bike share program for a low density australian city  adelaide   australia s experience with bike share has been disappointing  with the brisbane and melbourne schemes failing to achieve ridership forecasts  in contrast to the success of systems in europe  north america and asia  this project sought to capitalise on the lessons learnt from brisbane and melbourne  as well as the best practice examples from abroad to design a bike share system for adelaide  the project upon which this paper is based was commissioned by the city of adelaide and used a data led  gis intensive approach  breaking adelaide up into the smallest geographical parcels used by the australian bureau of statistics to develop a bike share propensity index  this index was made up of attributes known to influence bike share use  e g  density  demographics  current cycling levels   in addition to this catchment mapping activity  emerging technological opportunities were explored  such as electric assist bicycles  mobile phone activated sign up and integration with smartcard public transport ticketing  innovative policy measures to support bike share were also developed  including the need to investigate the effectiveness of a helmet waiver for bike share users  enhanced bicycle infrastructure and lower speed limits  this investigation found that it would take around four years for adelaide to develop the necessary pre conditions to support a successful bike share scheme  this analysis has found that once the necessary preconditions are met  a bike share scheme would assist adelaide in achieving its goal of a safer  more sustainable transport system and a more accessible  liveable city  
 biojet fuels and emissions mitigation in aviation  an integrated assessment modeling analysis although the aviation sector is a relatively small contributor to total greenhouse gas emissions  it is a fast growing  fossil fuel intensive transportation mode  because aviation is a mode for which liquid fuels currently have no practical substitute  biofuels are gaining attention as a promising cleaner alternative  in this paper  we use the gcam integrated assessment model to develop scenarios that explore the potential impact of biojet fuels for use in aviation in the context of broader climate change mitigation  we show that a carbon price would have a significant impact on the aviation sector  in the absence of alternatives to jet fuel from petroleum  mitigation potential is limited and would be at the expense of aviation service demand growth  however  mitigation efforts through the increased use of biojet fuels show potential to reduce the carbon intensity of aviation  without a significant impact on bioenergy use in the rest of the energy system for carbon mitigation  the potential of biofuel to decarbonize air transport is significantly enhanced when carbon dioxide capture and storage  ccs  is used in the conversion process to produce jet fuels from biomass feedstock   c  2017 published by elsevier ltd

 bounded rationality can make parking search more efficient  the power of lexicographic heuristics the search for parking space in busy urban districts is one of those routine human activities that are expected to benefit from the widespread adoption of pervasive sensing and radio communication technologies  proposed parking assistance solutions combine sensors  either as part of fixed infrastructure or onboard vehicles  wireless networking technologies and mobile social applications running on smartphones to collect  share and present to drivers real time information about parking demand and availability  one question that arises is how does  and should  the driver actually use such information to take parking decisions  e g   whether to search for on street parking space or drive to a parking lot and  in the latter case  which one  the paper is  hence  a performance analysis study that seeks to capture the highly behavioral and heuristic dimension of drivers  decisions and its impact on the efficiency of the parking search process  to this end  and in sharp contrast with the existing literature  we model drivers as agents of bounded rationality and assume that their choices are directed by lexicographic heuristics  an instance of the fast and frugal heuristics developed in behavioral sciences such as psychology and biology  we analyze the performance of the search process under these heuristics and compare it against the predictions of normative game theoretic models that assume fully rational strategically acting agents  we derive conditions under which the game theoretic norms turn out to be more pessimistic than the simpler heuristic choice rules and show that these are fulfilled for a broad range of scenarios concerning the fees charged for the parking resources and their distance from the destinations of the drivers  trips  the practical implications of these results for parking assistance solutions are identified and thoroughly discussed   c  2017 elsevier ltd  all rights reserved  
 brake reactions of distracted drivers to pedestrian forward collision warning systems introduction  forward collision warning  fcw  can be effective in directing driver attention towards a conflict and thereby aid in preventing or mitigating collisions  fcw systems aiming at pedestrian protection have been introduced onto the market  yet an assessment of their safety benefits depends on the accurate modeling of driver reactions when the system is activated  this study contributes by quantifying brake reaction time and brake behavior  deceleration levels and jerk  to compare the effectiveness of an audio visual warning only  an added haptic brake pulse warning  and an added head up display in reducing the frequency of collisions with pedestrians  further  this study provides a detailed data set suited for the design of assessment methods for car to pedestrian fcw systems  method  brake response characteristics were measured for heavily distracted drivers who were subjected to a single fcw event in a high fidelity driving simulator  the drivers maintained a self regulated speed of 30 km h in an urban area  with gaze direction diverted from the forward roadway by a secondary task  results  collision rates and brake reaction times differed significantly across fcw settings  brake pulse warnings resulted in the lowest number of collisions and the shortest brake reaction times  mean 0 8 s  sd 029 s   brake jerk and deceleration were independent of warning type  ninety percent of drivers exceeded a maximum deceleration of 3 6 m s 2  and a jerk of 53 m s 3   conclusions  brake pulse warning was the most effective fcw interface for preventing collisions  in addition  this study presents the data required for driver modeling for car to pedestrian fcw similar to euro ncap s 2015 car to car fcw assessment  practical applications  vehicle manufacturers should consider the introduction of brake pulse warnings to their fcw systems  euro ncap could introduce an assessment that quantifies the safety benefits of pedestrian fcw systems and thereby aid the proliferation of effective systems   c  2017 national safety council and elsevier ltd  all rights reserved  
 branch and price and cut for the split delivery vehicle routing problem with time windows and linear weight related cost this paper addresses a new vehicle routing problem that simultaneously involves time windows  split delivery  and linear weight related cost  this problem is a generalization of the split delivery vehicle routing problem with time windows  sdvrptw   which consists of determining a set of least cost vehicle routes to serve all customers while respecting the restrictions of vehicle capacity and time windows  the travel cost per unit distance is a linear function of the vehicle weight and the customer demand can be fulfilled by multiple vehicles  to solve this problem  we propose an exact branch and price and cut algorithm  where the pricing subproblem is a variant of the resource constrained elementary shortest path problem  we first prove that at least one optimal solution to the pricing subproblem is associated with an extreme delivery pattern  and then we design a tailored and novel label setting algorithm to solve the pricing subproblem  computational results show that our proposed algorithm can handle both the sdvrptw and our new problem effectively  
 break taking behaviour pattern of long distance freight vehicles based on gps trajectory data this study focuses on the break taking behaviour pattern of long distance freight vehicles  providing a new perspective on the study of behaviour patterns and simultaneously providing a reference for transport management departments and related enterprises  on the basis of global positioning system trajectory data  the authors select stopping points as break taking sites of long distance freight vehicles and then classify the stopping points into three different classes based on the break taking duration  they then explore the relationship of the distribution of the break taking frequency between the three single classifications and their combinations  on the basis of the break taking duration distribution  they find that the combination is a gaussian distribution when each of the three individual classes is a gaussian distribution  contrasting with the power law distribution of the break taking duration  then  they do experimental analysis to the distribution of the break taking durations and frequencies  and find that  for the durations  the three single classifications can be fitted individually by an exponential distribution and together by a power law distribution  for the frequencies  both the three single classifications and together can be fitted by a gaussian distribution  so that it can validate the above theoretical analysis

 can cycling safety be improved by opening all unidirectional cycle paths for cycle traffic in both directions  a theoretical examination of available literature and data many studies have found bicycle motor vehicle crashes to be more likely on bidirectional cycle paths than on unidirectional cycle paths because drivers do not expect cyclists riding at the right side of the road  in this paper we discuss the hypothesis that opening all unidirectional cycle paths for cycle traffic in both directions prevent this lack of expectancy and accordingly improves cycling safety  a new national standard requires careful consideration because a reversal is difficult once cyclists are used to their new freedom of route choice  we therefore explored the hypothesis using available data  research  and theories  the results show that of the length of cycle paths along distributor roads in the netherlands  72  is bidirectional  if drivers would become used to cyclists riding at the left side of the road  this result raises the question of why bidirectional cycle paths in the netherlands still have a poor safety record compared to unidirectional cycle paths  moreover  our exploration suggested that bidirectional cycle paths have additional safety problems  it increases the complexity of unsignalized intersections because drivers have to scan more directions in a short period of time  moreover  there are some indications that the likelihood of frontal crashes between cyclists increases  we reject the hypothesis that opening all unidirectional cycle paths for cycle traffic in both directions will improve cycle safety  we recommend more attention for mitigating measures given the widespread application of bidirectional cycle paths in the netherlands   c  2016 elsevier ltd  all rights reserved  
 can cyclist safety be improved with intelligent transport systems  in recent years  intelligent transport systems  its  have assisted in the decrease of road traffic fatalities  particularly amongst passenger car occupants  vulnerable road users  vrus  such as pedestrians  cyclists  moped riders and motorcyclists  however  have not been that much in focus when developing its  therefore  there is a clear need for its which specifically address vrus as an integrated element of the traffic system  this paper presents the results of a quantitative safety impact assessment of five systems that were estimated to have high potential to improve the safety of cyclists  namely  blind spot detection  bsd   bicycle to vehicle communication  b2v   intersection safety  ins   pedestrian and cyclist detection system   emergency braking  pcds   ebr  and vru beacon system  vbs   an ex ante assessment method proposed by kulmala  2010  targeted to assess the effects of its for cars was applied and further developed in this study to assess the safety impacts of its specifically designed for vrus  the main results of the assessment showed that all investigated systems affect cyclist safety in a positive way by preventing fatalities and injuries  the estimates considering 2012 accident data and full penetration showed that the highest effects could be obtained by the implementation of pcds   ebr and b2v  whereas vbs had the lowest effect  the estimated yearly reduction in cyclist fatalities in the eu 28 varied between 77 and 286 per system  a forecast for 2030  taking into accounts the estimated accident trends and penetration rates  showed the highest effects for pcds   ebr and bsd   c  2016 elsevier ltd  all rights reserved  
 can evolutionary theory explain the slow development of knowledge about the level of safety built into roads  in several papers  hauer  1988  1989  2000a  2000b  2016  has argued that the level of safety built into roads is unpremeditated  i e  not the result of decisions based on knowledge of the safety impacts of design standards  hauer has pointed out that the development of knowledge about the level of safety built into roads has been slow and remains incomplete even today  based on these observations  this paper asks whether evolutionary theory can contribute to explaining the slow development of knowledge  a key proposition of evolutionary theory is that knowledge is discovered through a process of learning by doing  it is not necessarily produced intentionally by means of research or development  an unintentional discovery of knowledge is treacherous as far as road safety is concerned  since an apparently effective safety treatment may simply be the result of regression to the mean  the importance of regression to the mean was not fully understood until about 1980  and a substantial part of what was regarded as known at that time may have been based on studies not controlling for regression to the mean  an attempt to provide an axiomatic foundation for designing a safe road system was made by gunnarsson and lindstrom  1970   this had the ambition of providing universal guidelines that would facilitate a preventive approach  rather than the reactive approach based on accident history  i e  designing a system known to be safe  rather than reacting to events in a system of unknown safety   three facts are notable about these principles  first  they are stated in very general terms and do not address many of the details of road design or traffic control  second  they are not based on experience showing their effectiveness  third  they are partial and do not address the interaction between elements of the road traffic system  in particular road user adaptation to system design  another notable fact consistent with evolutionary theory  is that the safety margins built into various design elements have been continuously eroded by the development of bigger and faster motor vehicles  that can only be operated safely if roads are wider and straighter than they needed to be when motor vehicles were smaller and moved slower  
 can stopovers be induced to revisit transit hubs as stayovers  a new perspective on the relationship between air transportation and tourism this research examines the potential of transit hubs and affiliated airlines to stimulate future stayover visits by stopover passengers  thereby securing new market opportunities for the host destination and a new relationship between the transportation and tourism sectors  data were obtained from 694 stopovers who transited with singapore airlines through singapore changi international airport but had no prior stayover visit   high influence    low influence  and  selected influence  clusters indicated how nine selected services and facilities differentially stimulated their interest to revisit singapore  especially influential are generic services such as the singapore girl service style  and specific facilities such as the airport butterfly garden  these therefore no longer situate as simple facilities that only provide utilitarian transport services for passengers  occupying the blurred boundaries between the transit and destination regions  they frame singapore s hub airport and national carrier as a type of  quasi destination   appropriate strategic considerations are recommended to maximise their conversion potential   c  2017 elsevier ltd  all rights reserved  
 can vehicle longitudinal jerk be used to identify aggressive drivers  an examination using naturalistic driving data this paper investigated the characteristics of vehicle longitudinal jerk  change rate of acceleration with respect to time  by using vehicle sensor data from an existing naturalistic driving study  the main objective was to examine whether vehicle jerk contains useful information that could be potentially used to identify aggressive drivers  initial investigation showed that there are unique characteristics of vehicle jerk in drivers  gas and brake pedal operations  thus two jerk based metrics were examined   1  driver s frequency of using large positive jerk when pressing the gas pedal  and  2  driver s frequency of using large negative jerk when pressing the brake pedal  to validate the performance of the two metrics  drivers were firstly divided into an aggressive group and a normal group using three classification methods  1  traveling at excessive speed  speeding    2  following too closely to a front vehicle  tailgating   and  3  their association with crashes or near crashes in the dataset  the results show that those aggressive drivers defined using any of the three methods above were associated with significantly higher values of the two jerk based metrics  between the two metrics the frequency of using large negative jerk seems to have better performance in identifying aggressive drivers  a sensitivity analysis shows the findings were largely consistent with varying parameters in the analysis  the potential applications of this work include developing quantitative surrogate safety measures to identify aggressive drivers and aggressive driving  which could be potentially used to  for example  provide real time or post ride performance feedback to the drivers  or warn the surrounding drivers or vehicles using the connected vehicle technologies  
 canadian drivers  attitudes regarding preventative responses to driving while impaired by alcohol background  in many jurisdictions  a risk assessment following a first driving while impaired  dwi  offence is used to guide administrative decision making regarding driver relicensing  decision error in this process has important consequences for public security on one hand  and the social and economic well being of drivers on the other  decision theory posits that consideration of the costs and benefits of decision error is needed  and in the public health context  this should include community attitudes  the objective of the present study was to clarify whether canadians prefer decision error that  i  better protects the public  i e   false positives   or ii  better protects the offender  i e   false negatives   methods  a random sample of male and female adult drivers  n   1213  from the five most populated regions of canada was surveyed on drivers  preference for a protection of the public approach versus a protection of dwi drivers approach in resolving assessment decision error  and the relative value  i e   value ratio  they imparted to both approaches  the role of region  sex and age on drivers  value ratio were also appraised  results  seventy percent of canadian drivers preferred a protection of the public from dwi approach  with the overall relative ratio given to this preference  compared to the alternative protection of the driver approach  being 3 1  females expressed a significantly higher value ratio  m   3 4  sd   3 5  than males  m   3 0  sd   3 4   p   0 05  regression analysis showed that both days of alcohol use in the past 30 days  ci for b   0 07   0 02  and frequency of driving over legal bac limits in the past year  ci for b    0 19   0 01  were significantly but modestly related to lower value ratios  r 2 adj     0 014  p   0 001  regional differences were also detected  conclusions  canadian drivers strongly favour a protection of the public approach to dealing with uncertainty in assessment  even at the risk of false positives  accounting for community attitudes concerning dwi prevention and the individual differences that influence them could contribute to more informed  coherent and effective regional policies and prevention program development  
 cannabis and crash responsibility while driving below the alcohol per se legal limit there is a growing interest in how extensively the use of marijuana by drivers relates to crash involvement  while cognitive  lab based studies are consistent in showing that the use of cannabis impairs driving tasks  epidemiological  field based studies have been inconclusive regarding whether cannabis use causes an increased risk of accidents  there is ample evidence that the presence of cannabis among drivers with a bac 0 08 g dl highly increases the likelihood of a motor vehicle crash  less clear  however  is the contribution of cannabis to crash risk when drivers have consumed very little or no alcohol  this effort addresses this gap in knowledge  we took advantage of a unique database that merged fatal crashes in the california statewide integrated traffic records system  switrs  and the fatality analysis reporting system  fars   which allows for a precise identification of crash responsibility  to account for recent increase in lab testing  we restricted our sample to cover only the years 1993 2009  a total of 4294 drivers were included in the analyses  descriptive analyses and logistic regressions were run to model the contribution of alcohol and drugs to the likelihood of being responsible in a fatal crash  we found evidence that compared with drivers negative for alcohol and cannabis  the presence of cannabis elevates crash responsibility in fatal crashes among drivers at zero bacs  or   1 89  and with 0   bac   0 05 g dl  or   3 42   suggesting that emphasis on curbing impaired driving should not be solely focused on heavy drinking drivers  data limitations however caution about the generalizability of study findings  special efforts to understand the effect of cannabis on fatal crashes  in particular in the absence of alcohol  are needed

 cell phone use while driving  prospective association with emerging adult use secondary task engagement such as cell phone use while driving is a common behavior among adolescents and emerging adults  texting and other distracting cell phone use in this population contributes to the high rate of fatal car crashes  peer engagement in similar risky driving behaviors  such as texting  could socially influence driver phone use behavior  the present study investigates the prospective association between peer and emerging adult texting while driving the first year after high school  surveys were conducted with a national sample of emerging adults and their nominated peers  binomial logistic regression analyses  adjusting for gender  race ethnicity  parental education  and family affluence  showed that participants  n   212  with peers  n   675  who reported frequently texting while driving  were significantly more likely to text while driving the following year  odds ratio  3 01  95  ci  1 19 7 59  p   0 05   the findings are consistent with the idea that peer texting behavior influences the prevalence of texting while driving among emerging adults  
 cellular automaton model with dynamical 2d speed gap relation this paper proposes an improved cellular automaton traffic flow model based on the brake light model  taking into account that the desired time gap of vehicles is larger than one second  although the hypothetical steady state of vehicles in the deterministic limit corresponds to a unique relationship between speeds and gaps in the proposed model  the traffic states of vehicles dynamically span a two dimensional region in the plane of speed versus gap  due to the various randomizations  we show that our model reproduces  i  the free flow  synchronized flow  wide moving jams  as well as transitions among the three phases   ii  the evolution features of disturbances and the spatiotemporal patterns in a car following platoon   iii  the empirical time series of traffic speed obtained from next generation simulation data  furthermore  the basic feature of time headway distribution is also qualitatively reproduced  therefore  we argue that a model has the potential to reproduce the empirical and experimental features of traffic flow  provided that the traffic states can dynamically span a 2d speed gap region

 changes in speed distribution  applying aggregated safety effect models to individual vehicle speeds this study investigated the effect of applying two aggregated models  the power model and the exponential model  to individual vehicle speeds instead of mean speeds  this is of particular interest when the measure introduced affects different parts of the speed distribution differently  the aim was to examine how the estimated overall risk was affected when assuming the models are valid on an individual vehicle level  speed data from two applications of speed measurements were used in the study  an evaluation of movable speed cameras and a national evaluation of new speed limits in sweden  the results showed that when applied on individual vehicle speed level compared with aggregated level  there was essentially no difference between these for the power model in the case of injury accidents  however  for fatalities the difference was greater  especially for roads with new cameras where those driving fastest reduced their speed the most  for the case with new speed limits  the individual approach estimated a somewhat smaller effect  reflecting that changes in the 15th percentile  p15  were somewhat larger than changes in p85 in this case  for the exponential model there was also a clear  although small  difference between applying the model to mean speed changes and individual vehicle speed changes when speed cameras were used  this applied both for injury accidents and fatalities  there were also larger effects for the exponential model than for the power model  especially for injury accidents  in conclusion  applying the power or exponential model to individual vehicle speeds is an alternative that provides reasonable results in relation to the original power and exponential models  but more research is needed to clarify the shape of the individual risk curve  it is not surprising that the impact on severe traffic crashes was larger in situations where those driving fastest reduced their speed the most  further investigations on use of the power and or the exponential model at individual vehicle level would require more data on the individual level from a range of international studies   c  2017 elsevier ltd  all rights reserved

 children s incidental social interaction during travel international case studies from canada  japan  and sweden incidental social interactions such as seeing a known person while travelling are theorized to contribute to community connections and social capital  it is argued in such work that walking may be a critical factor  but the frequency of such interactions is generally unknown  for children  these community connections may increase independent travel and contribute to their well being  previous research out of japan found that walking was indeed more likely to result in children seeing people in general and seeing a known person  however  it is not clear whether that is a culturally anecdotal finding  or whether similar findings would occur in different cultural and transportation contexts  reasons why it may be anecdotal include  in most cases  all elementary school children walk to school in japan  many trips occur at a local level and are conducted by non motorized modes in japan  greeting others  aisatsu  is a cultural value in japan  this study examines whether one s transport mode relates to having incidental social interaction during their trips for children aged 10 11 in canada  177   japan  178   and sweden  144   further to previous work  the research carried out here asked the children what type of interaction occurred  spoke  waved  no interaction  or other  which would relate to building or maintaining community connections  the findings demonstrate that the results are internationally applicable and that most incidental social interactions result in a verbal communication in all three countries  
 children s travel to school  satisfaction  current mood  and cognitive performance we investigate whether travel mode  travel time  and activities during travel influence children s satisfaction with their travel to school  their current mood  and their cognitive performance after arriving at school  a sample of 344 children  165 girls  between the ages of 10 and 15 years were recruited at five public schools in varmland county  sweden  directly after arriving at school  the children rated how they felt on two scales ranging from very sad to very happy and from very tired to very alert  filled out the satisfaction with travel scale adapted for children  sts c   reported details about their journeys  and took a word fluency test  the results for sts c showed that traveling by school bus and walking or cycling was experienced as having a higher quality than traveling by car  children who engaged in conversation during their journeys reported a higher quality and more positive feelings than children who were engaged in solitary activities during their journeys  a shorter journey was experienced as having a higher quality and resulting in more positive feelings  children traveling for longer durations performed better in the word fluency test if using their smartphones or doing a combination of activities during their journeys  
 choice of transport mode in emerging adulthood  differences between secondary school students  studying young adults and working young adults and relations with gender  ses and living environment background  encouraging sustainable travel behavior in emerging adults is important because this transport choice might persist into adulthood  however  research on transport habits in emerging adulthood is scarce  this study aimed to examine potential differences in walking  cycling  car use and public transport use between three groups of emerging adults  secondary school students  17 18 yrs   studying young adults  18 25 yrs  and working young adults   18 25 yrs    and to investigate differences in choice of transport modes within each of the three groups according to gender  ses and living environment  methods  a cross sectional design was used to collect self reported data via an online survey that assessed socio demographic variables  commuting  to work or school  and transport to other destinations  1307 emerging adults completed the questionnaire  zero inflated negative binomial regression models were used  the four dependent variables were minutes per week walking  cycling  car use and public transport use  results  compared to the other two groups  secondary school students were most likely to cycle  studying young adults were most likely to walk and use public transport and working young adults were most likely to use a car  in each of the three groups  men were more likely to cycle than women and women were more likely to commute by car to work  school than men  female secondary school students were also more likely to use a car to other destinations  in each of the three groups  urban emerging adults were more likely to walk and less likely to use a car than those living in rural areas  urban studying young adults were more likely to cycle to other destinations and urban working young adults were more likely to cycle to work than their rural counterparts  urban secondary school students were less likely to use public transport to school  although urban studying young adults and working young adults were more likely to use public transport than their rural counterparts  in each of the three groups  high ses emerging adults were more likely to travel by car to other destinations than those with low ses  conclusions  future active transport interventions should focus on female emerging adults and on maintaining the habit of cycling after reaching the age at which it is possible to obtain a driver s license  more research on the travel behavior of working young adults is needed as this often neglected target group was least likely to use active and public transport and most likely to travel by car among the three comparison groups  encouraging the combined use of active and public transport might help to decrease car use when travelling longer distances   c  2017 elsevier ltd  all rights reserved

 closed loop supply chain network design under demand and return uncertainty this study considers an integrated closed loop supply chain  clsc  network design problem under uncertainty with regard to product demand and return quantities  to incorporate uncertainty in decision making  we formulate a two stage stochastic mixed integer linear programming model to determine the optimal locations of  re manufacturing and processing facilities along with their capacity levels and forward and reverse product flows in the clsc network to minimize total design and expected operation costs  for the solution of the model and its analysis  we develop a benders decomposition approach enhanced for computational efficiency using induced constraints  strengthened benders cuts  and multiple benders cuts as well as mean value scenario based lower bounding inequalities obtained by dual subproblem disaggregation  computational results illustrate that the enhancements provide substantial improvements in terms of solution times and quality  using our model and the solution approach in a sample average approximation framework  we provide further analysis of network designs based on inspection location and recovery rates  although product inspection at retailer or collection center locations generally reduce costs by avoiding unnecessary use of resources  our analysis also indicates that parameters such as product type and reason for return  expected recovery rates  inspection costs  and transportation costs can be instrumental in deciding where the return product inspection should take place and  in turn  dictating the overall cost as well as the structure of the clsc network  
 co2 emission evaluation of yard tractors during loading at container terminals co2 emission generated by yard tractors at container terminals have been proven to be one of the main sources of pollution from maritime transportation  this paper aims to offer a method for evaluating the emissions from yard tractors during loading  first  an assignment model of export containers is built to capture the behavior of tractor arrivals at each block when the loading begins and the queuing theory is used to model the congestion happening in the yard  second  emissions from yard tractors are evaluated based on the forecast arrivals  the emissions are categorized into two types  one from those tractors which are moving at normal speed and the other from those tractors sitting in traffic jam or at the stop and go state  terminals with different calls and diversified storage utilization are simulated to show the performance of the proposed method and identify potential measures for traffic management aiming to reduce transport emissions  it is shown that the emissions from the yard tractors are closely related to the location of export containers and should be a main concern in operating a busy terminal   c  2017 elsevier ltd  all rights reserved  
 co2 emissions correction of light duty vehicles based on an energy deviation analysis method in present study  a total of 3 types of light duty vehicles were tested for 7 types of driving modes by using a vehicle dynamics based simulation method  deviations between the target and actual test vehicle speed and inaccurate chassis dynamometer road load settings are selected as the two main factors affecting the co2 emission measurement test  126 cases of simulations were conducted to analyze the effects of the deviation between the target and actual test vehicle speed on co2 emissions and 63 cases of simulation were conducted to analyze the effectiveness of inaccurate road load test conditions on co2 emissions  then  the co2 correlation method proposed by world forum for harmonization of vehicle regulations  wp 29  un  was applied for simulated results in original simulation cases  and a correction to performance was validated by comparative analysis  from the simulation results  it is revealed that velocity and road load deviation are related to distinct changes in fuel efficiency and co2 emission rates of test vehicles  also  it is revealed that co2 correction method show good performance to reduce the relative error lower than 2  in all test cases  
 coauthorship network in transportation research the field of transportation research has been accelerating in the last decade  in this paper  we examine the structure of scientific collaboration in transportation research by building a coauthorship network using publication metadata from 22 transportation journals  in this network  a vertex represents a researcher and an edge represents the collaboration  coauthorship  between a pair of researchers  to build an accurate network  we propose and apply an efficient author name correction algorithm  the obtained network provides us with a tool to understand patterns of collaborations in transportation research  the results show an increasing trend of collaboration over the studied period  1990 2015   but different journals exhibit different patterns  we characterize the structural properties of this network and compute several centrality measures to quantify the performance impact of researchers and their collaborations in the research community  this study could serve as a tool to qualitatively and quantitatively understand scientific collaborations in transportation research   c  2017 elsevier ltd  all rights reserved  
 code share connectivity within global airline alliances   how much potential is utilized  this paper analyzes the code share connectivity of carriers from the three global alliances  star alliance  sky team and oneworld  we generate 2 leg online and code share connections to evaluate the existing connectivity  additionally  we generate all potential interline connections between members of the same alliance that are not yet supported with existing code shares and analyze what share of the potential connectivity remains unused  we find that code share connections account to about one fourth of the total number of international connections offered by alliance members  73  of those code share connections are with partners from the same alliance  6  with carriers from competing alliances and the rest with other carriers  which means that airlines seek partnerships not only within their own global alliance but even with members of competing alliances  at the same time  over 25  of the total potential code share connections between members of the same alliance remain unused  this connectivity potential is better utilized within the network of sky team and oneworld than within star alliance  american and european carriers show a higher degree of code share partnership with their alliance partners than asian carriers  overall  code share partnerships are strongly driven by strategic decisions on bilateral airline level  many airline pairs fully utilize their connectivity potential  almost half of the total existing code share connections  but some cooperate only on selected routes or not at all  over one third of the remaining code share connectivity potential within alliances is attributed to airline pairs that don t partner at all   c  2017 elsevier ltd  all rights reserved  
 cognitive behavioral determinants of using helmet by motorcyclists in a rural community background  wearing a helmet while riding a motorcycle is influenced by various factors such as the existing traffic rules  environmental factors  law enforcement by the police  social norms  and the community s common beliefs  the purpose of this study was to identify the cognitive behavioral factors of not using helmet in a rural community and to investigate whether the theory of planned behavior  tpb  could predict not wearing helmets by motorcyclists  methods  the sample for this cross sectional study consisted of 150 motorcyclists  the setting was a rural community in charoymag  located in north west of iran  a written questionnaire  interviews  and personal observations were used to collect the data  two types of modeling approaches  general sem and multi groups sem  were used to address the specific aims of study based on the theory of planned behavior  results  approximately  47  of the motorcyclists did not wear helmets during the prior 30 days and only 8  stated that they always used a helmet while riding  subjective norms supporting the use of helmets  p   0 001  and perceived behavioral control  p   0 001  were the statistically significant predictors of wearing helmets  perceived behavioral control  p   0 14   positive attitudes towards wearing helmet  p   0 86   and subjective norms in support of using helmet  p   0 33  were not statistically significant in predicting the intention to wear the helmet in the near future  additionally  intention to wear helmet could not predict wearing helmet in this study  conclusions  perceived behavioral control and social norms can be influential in using the helmet in a traditional rural setting  which can be used in planning head injury prevention programs for motorcyclists in rural communities  
 column generation for outbound baggage handling at airports the planning of outbound baggage handling at international airports is challenging  outgoing flights have to be assigned and scheduled to handling facilities at which the outgoing baggage is loaded into containers  to avoid disruptions of the system the objective is to minimize workload peaks over the entire system  the resource demand of the jobs that have to be scheduled depends on the arrival process of the baggage  in this paper we present a time indexed mathematical programming formulation for planning the outbound baggage  we propose an innovative decomposition procedure in combination with a column generation scheme to solve practical problem instances  the decomposition significantly reduces the symmetry effect in the time indexed formulation and also speeds up the computational time of the corresponding dantzig wolfe formulation  to further improve our column generation algorithm we propose state of the art acceleration techniques for the primal problem and the pricing problem  computational results based on real data from a major european airport show that the proposed procedure reduces the maximal workloads by more than 60  compared to the current assignment procedure used  
 coming back into the loop  drivers  perceptual motor performance in critical events after automated driving this driving simulator study  conducted as part of the eu adaptive project  investigated drivers  performance in critical traffic events  during the resumption of control from an automated driving system  prior to the critical events  using a between participant design  75 drivers were exposed to various screen manipulations that varied the amount of available visual information from the road environment and automation state  which aimed to take them progressively further  out of the loop   ootl   the current paper presents an analysis of the timing  type  and rate of drivers  collision avoidance response  also investigating how these were influenced by the criticality of the unfolding situation  results showed that the amount of visual information available to drivers during automation impacted on how quickly they resumed manual control  with less information associated with slower take over times  however  this did not influence the timing of when drivers began a collision avoidance manoeuvre  instead  the observed behaviour is in line with recent accounts emphasising the role of scenario kinematics in the timing of driver avoidance response  when considering collision incidents in particular  avoidance manoeuvres were initiated when the situation criticality exceeded an inverse time to collision value of approximate to 0 3 s  1   our results suggest that take over time and timing and quality of avoidance response appear to be largely independent  and while long take over time did not predict collision outcome  kinematically late initiation of avoidance did  hence  system design should focus on achieving kinematically early avoidance initiation  rather than short take over times  
 commercial vehicles time of day choice behavior in urban areas this study presents a mixed multiple discrete continuous probit  mdcp  modeling framework to describe time of day choice behavior of commercial vehicles and the vehicle miles traveled  vmt  at the chosen time s  of day  the mixed mdcp model recognizes the unobserved heterogeneity across commercial vehicles in response to customer to customer travel speeds  and service time dwell time at customer stops due to customer preferences for predefined business hours  possible common unobserved factors affecting different times of day are also captured estimating a general covariance error structure  the estimated models show that a host of factors affect commercial vehicle time of day choice behavior  these include commercial vehicle class  type  commodity type  total unloading weight  as well as location features of base and intermediate stops  frequency of stops to office locations and construction sites  and time of day attributes including travel speed and service time  the results indicate that travel needs  are for the most part  influenced by activity needs  the estimated model can be used to predict the likelihood of commercial vehicle time of day choice for performing daily activities and the vmt generated at the chosen time s  of day   c  2016 elsevier ltd  all rights reserved

 commute responses to employment decentralization  anticipated versus actual mode choice behaviors of new town employees in kunming  china this study examines workers  mode choice responses to a typical job decentralization policy implemented in china s urban development   government job relocation  gjr  to new towns in the urban periphery  broadly  the literature suggests that job decentralization tends to increase car commuting  however  little is known about the effects of china s gjr initiatives on individuals  commuting mode choices  using kunming as a case study  this study examines how workers  commuting mode choices have shifted in response to the gjr policy  our study analyzes two travel survey datasets that span the job relocation process   1  stated preference  sp  data on workers  anticipated mode choices after a move of workplace to a planned new town  and  2  revealed preference  rp  data on workers  actual choices of commuting mode after their jobs were moved  the findings suggest that after job relocation  workers  actual commuting modes shift from more sustainable modes towards cars  the determinants of workers  mode choices differ substantially between the hypothetical and actual setting of job relocation  the anticipated mode choices are largely determined by socio demographic characteristics whereas the actual mode choices are strongly influenced by travel time and housing locations  the evidence from this study offers two important implications for future planning practice of job decentralization  first  planners and policy makers should be skeptical about the transportation benefits of job decentralization  second  while sp surveys can assist planners to predict individuals  mode choice responses  the robustness of sp results should be carefully assessed before translating into the evidence base for informing job decentralization policy makings   c  2016 elsevier ltd  all rights reserved  
 commuters  acceptance of and behavior reactions to license plate restriction policy  a case study of tianjin  china license plate restriction  lpr  policies are currently being implemented in major chinese cities with the aim of mitigating traffic congestions  meanwhile  much controversy regarding the effectiveness of the lpr policies is arising  to better understand the impact of the lpr policies  this paper studies commuters  acceptance of and behavior reactions to the policies after their implementation  a theoretical model was proposed as the first step  followed by a questionnaire survey that was conducted in tianjin  china  where an lpr policy has been in place since march 2014  car owners frequently commuting within the restricted area were sampled as respondents  and a multi variable regression method was employed to analyze the collected survey data  the results indicate that it is necessary to promote public s acceptance of the lpr policy  because lower acceptance will lead to more negative reactions towards the policy  which may weaken its effectiveness  main factors affecting the level of acceptance of the policy are also found  which may serve as a reference for transportation authorities seeking to increase commuters  acceptance of the policy  these findings are beneficial to designing and implementing lpr policies   c  2016 elsevier ltd  all rights reserved  
 comparative analysis of port performance indicators  independency and interdependency port performance measurement  ppm  and comparison research  presenting a multiple criteria decision making  mcdm  issue in nature  has been intensively conducted by researchers from both decision science on modelling and port studies from empirical perspectives  assigning an appropriate weight to each defined port performance indicator  ppi  is essential for rational decision and precise performance measurement  however  ppis are often presented in a hierarchy  having the interdependency among them ignored  it causes concerns on the accuracy of ppis  weight allocation and arguments on the performance measurement results  revealing a significant research gap to be addressed  as far as mcdm modelling is concerned  the importance of criteria has been studied utilising either absolute or  relative comparisons  while the calculation of their importance also takes into account both independency and interdependency factors  however  there is lack of empirical studies in the literature to provide supporting evidence to distinguish the different impacts of the two factors  this study aims to compare the analysis of ppis importance when taking into account their independent relationship using an analytic hierarchy process  ahp  and their interdependent relationship using a decision making trial and evaluation laboratory  dematel  incorporating an analytic network process  anp   respectively  the same domain experts are invited to evaluate the importance of the defined ppis based on both approaches  the results demonstrate that a similar variance of relative importance across the ppis but a clear difference on their importance scores and ranking  as a result  the results make contributions to fulfil the research gap on consideration of interdependency among ppis in ppm and on the provision of convincing empirical evidence to highlight the impact of interdependency of criteria on mcdm modelling  another practical significance draw from this study is that use of dematel can aid port stakeholders to make more rational decision as to whether the interdependency among ppis should be taken into account in ppm and or port choice   c  2017 elsevier ltd  all rights reserved

 comparative analysis of zonal systems for macro level crash modeling introduction  macro level traffic safety analysis has been undertaken at different spatial configurations  however  clear guidelines for the appropriate zonal system selection for safety analysis are unavailable  in this study  a comparative analysis was conducted to determine the optimal zonal system for macroscopic crash modeling considering census tracts  ci s   state wide traffic analysis zones  stazs   and a newly developed traffic related zone system labeled traffic analysis districts  tads   method  poisson lognormal models for three crash types  i e   total  severe  and non motorized mode crashes  are developed based on the three zonal systems without and with consideration of spatial autocorrelation  the study proposes a method to compare the modeling performance of the three types of geographic units at different spatial configurations through a grid based framework  specifically  the study region is partitioned to grids of various sizes and the model prediction accuracy of the various macro models is considered within these grids of various sizes  results  these model comparison results for all crash types indicated that the models based on tads consistently offer a better performance compared to the others  besides  the models considering spatial autocorrelation outperform the ones that do not consider it  conclusions  based on the modeling results and motivation for developing the different zonal systems  it is recommended using cts for socio demographic data collection  employing tazs for transportation demand forecasting  and adopting tads for transportation safety planning  practical applications  the findings from this study can help practitioners select appropriate zonal systems for traffic crash modeling  which leads to develop more efficient policies to enhance transportation safety   c  2017 national safety council and elsevier ltd  all rights reserved  
 comparative assessment of the behaviour of drivers with mild cognitive impairment or alzheimer s disease in different road and traffic conditions the objective of this research was the analysis of the driving performance of drivers with mild cognitive impairment  mci  or alzheimer s disease  ad   in different road and traffic conditions  on the basis of a driving simulator experiment  in this experiment  healthy  control  drivers  patients with mci  and patients with ad  drove at several scenarios at the simulator  after a thorough neurological and neuropsychological assessment  the scenarios include driving in rural and urban areas in low and high traffic volumes  the driving performance of healthy and impaired drivers was analysed and compared by means of repeated measures general linear modelling techniques  a sample of 75 participants was analysed  out of which 23 were mci patients and 14 were ad patients  various driving performance measures were examined  including longitudinal and lateral control measures  the results suggest that the two examined cerebral diseases do affect driving performance  and there were common driving patterns for both cerebral diseases  as well as particular characteristics of specific pathologies  more specifically  cognitively impaired drivers drive at lower speeds and with larger headway compared to healthy drivers  moreover  they appear to have difficulties in positioning the vehicle on the lane  the group of patients had difficulties in all road and traffic environments  and especially when traffic volume was high  most importantly  both cerebral diseases appear to significantly impair reaction times at incidents  the results of this research suggest that compensatory behaviours developed by impaired drivers are not adequate to counterbalance the direct effects of these cerebral diseases on driving skills  they also demonstrate that driving impairments increase as cognitive impairments become more severe  from mci to ad    c  2017 elsevier ltd  all rights reserved  
 comparative specific energy consumption between air transport and high speed rail transport  a practical assessment high speed railways have recently conquered market shares that were previously only covered by air transport  at daily distances up to 600 800 km  or by cars  for journeys of 100 150 km  mainly thanks to the much higher speeds that have been reached by highspeed trains since the late nineties  however  in recent years  the relevance of the dependence of the transport sector on black oil and the consequent emissions have drawn attention to the importance of energy efficiency as a significant parameter to compare alternative transport modes in a more complete way than travel time and covered distance  this paper has the purpose of    quantifying and comparing the specific energy consumption of air transport with that of high speed rail transport    determining the ranges in which operating  sometimes also investing  in one of these two modes would be convenient from the usage viewpoint and from an energy perspective    determining where there is still notable competition between these modes  the comparative analysis has been carried out taking into account original data and assessments linked to energy consumption  but it has also been considered important to investigate several other factors  such as the price of electricity compared to that of kerosene  it has been possible  through the use of rail simulation and of two different air transport simulation tools  to evaluate the consumption of the two transport modes in order to compare the two modal alternatives  rather original outcomes have been obtained  owing to the presence of a number of variables that can play an important role in a comparative specific energy consumption study on air and high speed rail transport  further analyses are envisaged  however  the present work represents a first  fundamental step towards obtaining a more complete vision of the problem   c  2017 elsevier ltd  all rights reserved  
 comparing physical activity of pedal assist electric bikes with walking and conventional bicycles this paper presents a study on physical activity implications of electric bikes  focusing on the users of an on campus conventional bicycle and e bike sharing system at the university of tennessee  the study describes field trials of 17 users of the bikesharing system and investigates physical activity metrics on identical trips made by three different modes  walk  conventional bicycle  and pedal assist electric bicycle  the users completed a hilly 4 43 kilometer route using each mode  heart rate and human power output were monitored along with gps for each bout  in addition  the study used a laboratory test to relate oxygen consumption rate  vo2 in ml kg min  and energy expenditure  ee kcal kg min  to user heart rate during bouts  energy expenditure and ventilation rates  per minute  for all modes were not statistically different  however  total ee and v02 for each bout  per mile  for e bikes are 24  lower than that for conventional bicycles  and 64  lower than for walking  this reflects the shorter travel time  differences between e bikes and bicycles are most pronounced on the uphill segment  still  e bikes provide moderate physical activity  met   3  on flat segments and downhill segments  and vigorous physical activity  met   6  on uphill segments  for e bike trials  riders reported higher levels of enjoyment and lower need for a shower than walk or conventional bicycle trials  this paper adds to the expanding literature by comparing e bike  bicycle and walk ee and vo2  e bikes can contribute as an active transportation mode to meet required physical activity guidelines  
 comparing public bus transport service attributes in delhi and mumbai  policy implications for improving bus services in delhi delhi and mumbai are large cities with a population of more than 15 million each  both cities have large bus systems  however  the share of bus users is much higher in mumbai as compared to delhi  there is a need to enhance the share of bus users in delhi to reduce the growing traffic externalities in the city  the objective of this work is to compare the existing bus services of delhi and mumbai  and identify feasible strategies to improve the bus system in delhi  a total of 1347 and 1045 bus passengers were surveyed in delhi and mumbai respectively to compare the existing bus systems of both cities  further  14 transportation experts in delhi were surveyed to identify feasible improvement strategies in delhi  multinomial logit  mnl  model and sign test were used to analyze the perception of bus users  the analyses reveal that overcrowding is a major concern in both the cities  but  unlike mumbai  delhi buses are perceived as less punctual and more time consuming by non captives users  as a result  share of non captive users that travel by buses in mumbai is higher as compared to delhi  in terms of interventions  improved comfort  punctuality  and safety are considered relatively easier to achieve in delhi as compared to reduction in travel time by experts  it is concluded that strategies to improve comfort  punctuality  travel time  and safety should be prioritized for bus services in delhi  
 comparing recall vs  recognition measures of accident under reporting  a two country examination a growing body of research suggests that national injury surveillance data significantly underestimate the true number of non fatal occupational injuries due to employee under reporting of workplace accidents  given the importance of accurately measuring such under reporting  the purpose of the current research was to examine the psychometric properties of two different techniques used to operationalize accident under reporting  one using a free recall methodology and the other a recognition based approach  moreover  in order to assess the cross cultural generalizability of these under reporting measures  we replicated our psychometric analyses in the united states  n   440  and italy  n   592   across both countries  the results suggest that both measures exhibited similar patterns of relationships with known antecedents  including job insecurity  production pressure  safety compliance  and safety reporting attitudes  however  the recall measures had more severe violations of normality and were less correlated with self report workplace injuries  considerations  implications  and recommendations for using these different types of accident measures are discussed  
 comparison of four statistical and machine learning methods for crash severity prediction crash severity prediction models enable different agencies to predict the severity of a reported crash with unknown severity or the severity of crashes that may be expected to occur sometime in the future  this paper had three main objectives  comparison of the performance of four statistical and machine learning methods including multinomial logit  mnl   nearest neighbor classification  nnc   support vector machines  svm  and random forests  rf   in predicting traffic crash severity  developing a crash costs based approach for comparison of crash severity prediction methods  and investigating the effects of data clustering methods comprising k means clustering  kc  and latent class clustering  lcc   on the performance of crash severity prediction models  the 2012 2015 reported crash data from nebraska  united states was obtained and two vehicle crashes were extracted as the analysis data  the dataset was split into training estimation  2012 2014  and validation  2015  subsets  the four prediction methods were trained estimated using the training estimation dataset and the correct prediction rates for each crash severity level  overall correct prediction rate and a proposed crash costs based accuracy measure were obtained for the validation dataset  the correct prediction rates and the proposed approach showed nnc had the best prediction performance in overall and in more severe crashes  rf and svm had the next two sufficient performances and mnl was the weakest method  data clustering did not affect the prediction results of svm  but kc improved the prediction performance of mnl  nnc and rf  while lcc caused improvement in mnl and rf but weakened the performance of nnc  overall correct prediction rate had almost the exact opposite results compared to the proposed approach  showing that neglecting the crash costs can lead to misjudgment in choosing the right prediction method  
 comparison of major air freight network hubs in the us and china the increase in global economic connectivity spurred by ties between chinese manufacturing and a global market  particularly in high value low weight goods  pushed establishment of air cargo networks  these remain under examined but impactful particularly for second and third tier metropolitan hub cities  this research looks at the air freight connections within china  a major rapidly developing trade center  and use of the aerotropolis concept to accelerate growth in the lagging inland region  references are made to fedex and ups networks within their u s  headquarter region and in china to note differences in political economic contexts and china s adaptation of developed world models  the theoretical framework includes global production networks strategically coupled by transport logistics linked to aerotropolis type development  data comes from government aviation and transportation sources  research analyses  corporate and industry reports  and interviews with chinese officials  focus falls particularly on zhengzhou  capital of henan province in central china and the country s first airport centered economic zone  the conclusion finds that chinese hub cities more closely correspond to major manufacturing and population centers and central policy directives for development dispersion   c  2016 elsevier ltd  all rights reserved  
 comparison of older and younger novice driver crash rates  informing the need for extended graduated driver licensing restrictions background few previous studies have directly compared crash rates of older and younger novice drivers  to inform discussion about whether graduated driver licensing  gdl  policies  that are applied in the us for younger novice drivers should be applied to older novice drivers  we conducted a longitudinal study to examine overall  nighttime  and multiple passenger crash rates over the initial four years of licensure differ for novice drivers licensed at different ages  methods  using data from the new jersey traffic safety outcomes  nj tso  data warehouse  we selected all nj drivers who obtained their initial intermediate driver s license from 2006 through 2014 and had at least one month of follow up from the date of licensure to study end or death  n   1 034 835   novice drivers were grouped based on age at licensure  age 17  18 20  21 24  and 25 or older  we estimated monthly rates for overall crashes  per 10 000 licensed drivers  as well as  late night crashes  11 01 p m  4 59 a m    early night crashes  9 00 p m  11 00 p m    and multiple passenger crashes  two or more passengers   average monthly rates were calculated for specific relevant time periods and poisson regression models were used to compare rates   1  between novice driver groups with the same time since licensure   2  over the first 48 months of licensure within each novice driver group  and  3  between same aged 21 year old drivers with varying lengths of licensure  results  although initial  three months post licensure  overall crash rates of novice nj drivers age 21 and older were higher than rates of same aged experienced drivers  they were substantially lower than initial rates for 17 to 20 year old novice drivers  who are licensed under gdl policies  moreover  older novice drivers experience much less steep crash reductions over the first year of licensure than younger novice drivers  nighttime crash rates among the 21  to 24 year old and aged 25 and older novice driver groups were stable over the first year of licensure  for novice drivers under age 21  early night crash rates declined rapidly over the course of licensure  while changes in late night crashes were much smaller  first year multiple passenger crash rates were highest for drivers licensed at age 18 20  and novice driver groups experienced varying amounts of reduction in multiple passenger crashes over time  conclusions  study findings support nj s current gdl policies for 17  to 20 year old novice drivers and the potential for added benefits from beginning the nighttime restriction at 9 00 p m  conversely  there was a lack of compelling evidence for additional policies for drivers licensed at age 21 24 and no evidence to indicate a need for additional gdl policies for nj novices aged 25 years and older  
 comparison of the greenhouse gas and criteria pollutant emissions from the sf breeze high speed fuel cell ferry with a diesel ferry a theoretical comparison is made of the  well to waves   wtw  greenhouse gas  ghg  and criteria pollutant emissions from the sf breeze high speed hydrogen pem fuel cell ferry and the vallejo ferry powered by traditional diesel engine technology but constrained to tier 4 emissions standards  the emissions were calculated for a common maritime mission  the current ferry route between vallejo ca and san francisco ca  calculations are made of the energy required for the sf breeze and vallejo to perform the mission route profile  the sf breeze requires 10 1  more fuel energy than the vallejo  primarily due to the sf breeze being heavier  estimates are made for the sf breeze ghg emissions associated with five lh2 fuel production pathways including renewable and non renewable  fossil fuel based  methods  estimates are also made for ghg emissions associated with fossil diesel production and delivery as well as those for biodiesel  which can be considered a renewable  drop in  fuel replacement for conventional diesel fuel  we find that the ghg emissions for the sf breeze using non renewable lh2 are significantly higher than for the tier 4 diesel fueled vallejo on a per passenger basis  however  using renewable lh2  the ghg emissions for the sf breeze ferry are reduced 75 8  compared to the diesel fueled vallejo operating at tier 4 emissions standards  we also compare the criteria pollutant emissions  nox  hc  pm10  for the sf breeze to that of the vallejo held to tier 4 emissions standards fueled by diesel fuel or biodiesel  hydrogen pem fuel cell technology dramatically reduces nox and hc emissions below the most advanced tier 4 criteria pollutant emissions requirements regardless of whether the lh2 is made by ng reforming or via water electrolysis using 70  renewable energy  renewable lh2 made with greater than 84  renewable process energy is needed to also drop the sf breeze pm10 emissions below that of tier 4 for high speed fuel cell ferry transportation  overall  the results show that operating a hydrogen fuel cell ferry on nearly 100  renewable hydrogen provides the dramatic reduction in ghg and criteria pollutant emissions commensurate with the problems of global climate change and maritime air pollution worldwide   c  2017 elsevier ltd  all rights reserved  
 comparison of us metropolitan region pedestrian and bicyclist fatality rates annual us pedestrian and bicyclist fatalities involving motor vehicles have each increased by 30  in just six years  reaching their highest levels in two decades  to provide information to reverse this trend  we quantified pedestrian and bicyclist fatality rates in 46 of the largest us metropolitan statistical areas  msas  during two five year time periods  1999 2003 and 2007 2011  we divided the annual average number of pedestrian and bicyclist fatalities during 1999 2003 from the fatality analysis reporting system by the annual estimates of pedestrian and bicycle trips  kilometers traveled  and minutes traveled from the 2001 national household travel survey  nhts  and the annual average number of fatalities from 2007 to 2011 by similar estimates from the 2009 nhts  the five most dangerous regions for walking during 2007 2011 averaged 262 pedestrian fatalities per billion trips while the five safest averaged 49 pedestrian fatalities per billion trips  the five most dangerous regions for bicycling averaged 458 bicyclist fatalities per billion trips while the five safest averaged 75 bicyclist fatalities per billion trips  random effects meta analysis identified eight metropolitan regions as outliers with low pedestrian fatality rates  six with high pedestrian fatality rates  one with a low bicyclist fatality rate  and five with high bicyclist fatality rates  msas with low pedestrian and bicycle fatality rates tended to have central cities recognized as walk friendly communities and bicycle friendly communities for investing in pedestrian and bicycle projects and programs  random effects meta regression showed that certain socioeconomic characteristics and high pedestrian and bicyclist mode shares were associated with lower msa fatality rates  results suggest that pedestrian and bicycle infrastructure and safety programs should be complemented with strategies to increase walking and bicycling  in particular  safety initiatives should be honed to reduce pedestrian and bicyclist fatality risk in immigrant communities and to make pedestrian travel safer for the growing senior age population  
 competition and vested interests in taxis in ireland  a tale of two statutory instruments this paper addresses  for the taxi market in ireland  whether judicial  legislative and regulatory processes promote taxi users  welfare or taxi license holders  welfare  it is argued that the 2000 decision to remove quantitative restrictions on taxi numbers favoured taxi users  the 2010 decision to re impose such restrictions  with the exception of wheelchair accessible taxis  had the effect of favouring taxi license holders  while doing little to meet its declared object to increase the number of wheelchair accessible taxis and the ready availability of such vehicles for wheelchair customers  whether the late 2010s early 2020s will be a rerun of the late 1990s  with increasing waiting times for taxi users  is a moot point  an applicant refused a taxi license might  as in 2000  successfully bring a high court case contesting the legal basis for the present quantitative restrictions  the competition and consumer protection commission might spark debate on taxi regulatory policy  while the minister for transport  tourism and sport might issue a policy direction to the national transport authority  the taxi regulator  requiring it to clarify the objectives and benchmarks for success of its existing prohibition on taxi licenses and to consider how best to create incentives for those with wheelchair accessible taxis to use them to service wheelchair users   c  2017 elsevier ltd  all rights reserved  
 competition for long haul connecting traffic among airports in europe and the middle east this paper analyzes the competitive position of major hub airports in europe and the middle east for long haul connecting traffic  we apply a connection builder to construct competitive flight connections  a stand out feature of the proposed connection builder is the calibration of the model parameters using booking data  composed of actual passenger demand between a given origin and destination  o d  market  the methodology is applied to measure competition between hubs using flight schedule data to calculate connectivity measures like the number of city pairs connected via a hub airport  our results show that the middle eastern hubs have improved their competitive position  while the european hubs are more exposed to competition than their middle eastern counterparts   c  2017 elsevier ltd  all rights reserved  
 competitive responses of an established airline to the entry of a low cost carrier into its hub airports this paper investigates the competitive responses of china eastern to the entry of spring airlines into its hub airports in shanghai  the analysis takes into account of the actual and adjacent competition for both lccs and full service airlines  fsas  within an airport pair framework  the results of the econometric analysis showed that spring put downward pressure on the average fares of china eastern and other fsas  but china eastern responded more aggressively than other fsas to spring s competition on routes from the same and nearby airports  having said that  the moderate price reduction of 4  4 9  suggests that china eastern did not perceive spring as a serious competitor  such limited impacts are due to restrictions imposed by the regulator onto spring airlines in terms of capacity control and access to major trunk routes   c  2016 elsevier ltd  all rights reserved  
 complementarity and substitution between physical and virtual travel for instrumental information sharing in remote rural regions  a social network approach international development practitioners are highly optimistic that mobile phones can improve the lives of the inhabitants of remote rural areas in developing countries with an underdeveloped transportation infrastructure  however  the instrumental role of telecommunication is unclear in contexts where residents  information sharing networks are strongly geographically constrained by their limited mobility  empirical research on the interactions between telecommunication and travel in rural areas of developing countries is lacking  this study analyses physical and virtual contact patterns within 1270 instrumental information sharing relationships reported by the inhabitants of the pulau panggung and sumber rejo rural subdistricts of indonesia  in 2013  we implemented an exogenous mobility intervention  in 2014  we administered a network survey in 16 randomly selected farming groups to map local residents  egocentric and sociocentric physical and virtual travel networks  by comparing the observed networks with simulated random networks  analysing the relationship characteristics and their history  and performing a regression analysis with fixed effects  we examine the complementarity and substitution between telecommunication and travel in the creation and maintenance of social networks  by examining the effects of the exogenous intervention  we can explain the mechanisms underlying the uncovered associations  the results suggest path dependency between physical and virtual travel in remote rural areas  the implication for transportation policy is that physical mobility is a precondition for the creation of virtual information sharing links  instrumental communication relationships that do not socially require regular physical co presence can be partially substituted by virtual travel only after virtual links have been created through physical mobility  therefore  in contrast with general expectations  mobile telephony in remote rural regions is more practical if the transportation infrastructure is adequately developed  concludes with a discussion of the potential contribution of the sociocentric network perspective to transportation research   c  2017 the author  published by elsevier ltd  
 complex active travel bout motivations  gender  place  and social context associations active travel bouts are healthy  but bout specific motives  social  and physical contexts have been poorly characterized  adults  n 421 in 2012  436 in 2013  described their moderate activity bouts over the past week  aided by accelerometry gps data integration  participants viewed maps indicating date  time  and starting and ending locations of their past week moderate to vigorous active travel bouts of 3 or more minutes  these prompts helped participants recall their social and physical contexts and motives for the bouts  three bout motivations were modeled  leisure  transportation  and their  t l  difference scores  transportation minus leisure scores   blends of leisure and transportation motives characterized most bouts  even though most studies do not allow participants to endorse multiple motives for their active travel  bouts were often neighborhood based  leisure motives were related to pleasant place perceptions  homes  and exercise places  work places were associated with stronger transportation and t l bout motives  women s bout motives were more closely associated with place than men s  our novel method of individual bout assessment can illuminate the social ecological contexts and experiences of everyday healthy bouts of activity   c  2017 elsevier ltd all rights reserved  
 complexity reduction and sensitivity analysis in road probabilistic safety assessment bayesian network models this article is concerned with improving some existing methods for probabilistic safety analysis of roads and highways  after a quick review of a bayesian network model  in which special attention is devoted to human error and all safety related items or elements existing along the road are considered  important problems are dealt with and some solutions provided  this includes   1  a new and general method for a detailed description of the conditional probabilities of variables given their parents leading to closed form formulas   2  a partitioning technique that allows us to reduce drastically the cpu time required for the calculations  based on dividing the bayesian network into very small subnetworks using the conditional independence property and leading to a reduced complexity  which is linear in the number of variables or road length instead of the nonlinear character of alternative methods  and  3  a range sensitivity analysis method  which takes advantage of the partitioning technique and is superior to a local sensitivity analysis  finally  some real examples are provided to show the usefulness of the proposed methodologies to assess the safety of highways or conventional roads  
 concentrations and personal exposure to black carbon particles at airports and on commercial flights the volume of passengers carried by airlines increased by 57  globally in the period 2005 2014  this value is more outstanding when observed regionally  especially in developing countries  for example  brazil experienced a rise of 121  over the same period   this large growth of civil aviation enhances air pollution levels and poses health risks to passengers  airport workers and the population living close to airfields  we measured black carbon  bc  particle concentrations using hand held devices within different microenvironments of 12 airports and on 41 non smoking commercial flights  totalling 154 h of data  the largest bc concentrations were found during boarding and disembarking  mean 3 78 mu g m  3    followed by large concentrations at the airport concourse  mean 3 16 mu g m  3   and inside parked aircraft with open doors  mean 2 78 mu g m  3    bc levels were remarkably low when the aircraft were on the ground with the doors closed  mean 0 81 mu g m  3    with incidental relatively high concentrations  bc at 95th percentile   2 82 mu g m  3   suggesting that exhaust plumes from the apron enter the cabin through the ventilation system  the lowest bc concentrations were found during the flights  mean 0 20 mu g m 3   95th percentile   0 52 mu g m  3    the data show that the concourse and the transit to from the aircraft contributed disproportionally to the personal exposure and accounted for an average of 52  and 19  of the total exposure during a journey  respectively  the results suggest that these two microenvironments should be targeted to reduce exposure of passengers and airport workers to bc particles   c  2017 elsevier ltd  all rights reserved  
 congestion aware system optimal route choice for shared autonomous vehicles we study the shared autonomous vehicle  sav  routing problem while considering congestion  savs essentially provide a dial a ride service to travelers  but the large number of vehicles involved  tens of thousands of savs to replace personal vehicles  results in sav routing causing significant congestion  we combine the dial a ride service constraints with the linear program for system optimal dynamic traffic assignment  resulting in a congestion aware formulation of the sav routing problem  traffic flow is modeled through the link transmission model  an approximate solution to the kinematic wave theory of traffic flow  savs interact with travelers at origins and destinations  due to the large number of vehicles involved  we use a continuous approximation of flow to formulate a linear program  optimal solutions demonstrate that peak hour demand is likely to have greater waiting and in vehicle travel times than off peak demand due to congestion  sav travel times were only slightly greater than system optimal personal vehicle route choice  in addition  solutions can determine the optimal fleet size to minimize congestion or maximize service   c  2017 elsevier ltd  all rights reserved  
 connectivity at chinese airports  the evolution and drivers this study calculates the connectivity of 69 chinese airports and identifies the underlying drivers of the variation in airport connectivity over a period 2005 2016  our connectivity model incorporates multiple discount factors including capacity and velocity penalties to correct for the quality of a connection  we find that chinese airports experienced a great increase in air connectivity over the study period  beijing capital  shanghai pudong and guangzhou baiyun are far ahead of other airports in terms of overall connectivity and especially so in terms of international connectivity  however  the growth of some tourism cities and small cities has been stagnant and they suffered losses of connectivity at times  airport competition measured by hhi  average fare  investment in local city s fixed asset investment and airport facilities  macroeconomic conditions  and population are found to be closely associated with an airport s connectivity  we also find that the presence of low cost carriers is conducive for air connectivity  while hsr has the effect of decreasing airport connectivity   c  2017 elsevier ltd  all rights reserved  
 connectivity to international markets  a multi layered network approach improving connectivity for freight movements between countries is increasingly a topic at the centre of the international trade and transport policy agendas  in spite of this  a method to asses a country s degree of connectivity to its international markets for freight is still missing  to close this gap  this paper proposes a multi layered network approach that enables the assessment of   i  the different factors that influence connectivity to international markets  and  ii  the extent to which a country s connections matter for its international trade activities  the international trade network and its  support network  are analysed using network theory  the approach proposed is applied to the americas  a region the relevant literature has not specifically focused on yet  it is expected that a comprehensive understanding and assessment of the determinants of connectivity for freight will contribute to guide and design more effective policies to remove barriers to international trade flows  
 considering built environment and spatial correlation in modeling pedestrian injury severity objective  this study looks at mitigating and aggravating factors that are associated with the injury severity of pedestrians when they have crashes with another road user and overcomes existing limitations in the literature by focusing attention on the built environment and considering spatial correlation across crashes method  reports for 6 539 pedestrian crashes occurred in denmark between 2006 and 2015 were merged with geographic information system resources containing detailed information about the built environment and exposure at the crash locations  a linearized spatial logit model estimated the probability of pedestrians sustaining a severe or fatal injury conditional on the occurrence of a crash with another road user results  this study confirms previous findings about older pedestrians and intoxicated pedestrians being the most vulnerable road users and crashes with heavy vehicles and in roads with higher speed limits being related to the most severe outcomes  this study provides novel perspectives by showing positive spatial correlations of crashes with the same severity outcomes and emphasizing the role of the built environment in the proximity of the crash conclusions  this study emphasizes the need for thinking about traffic calming measures  illumination solutions  road maintenance programs  and speed limit reductions  moreover  this study emphasizes the role of the built environment  because shopping areas  residential areas  and walking traffic density are positively related to a reduction in pedestrian injury severity  often  these areas have in common a larger pedestrian mass that is more likely to make other road users more aware and attentive  whereas the same does not seem to apply to areas with lower pedestrian density  
 considering health in us metropolitan long range transportation plans  a review of guidance statements and performance measures transportation influences health primarily and most directly through traffic safety  air quality  physical activity  and accessibility  despite the importance of all four components  only safety and air quality are typically considered during institutionalized transportation planning processes  this paper assesses how health impacts are considered in transportation planning by focusing on the long range transportation plans that us metropolitan planning organizations develop  we analyzed the content of current plans from 25 large regions  reviewing how policy guidance statements and supporting performance measures addressed health  goals and objectives exhibited an incomplete perspective of transportation s effects on health  focusing on safety  accessibility  and air quality  neglecting physical activity  regional policies reflected national goals and planning requirements  which are rarely framed from a health perspective  performance measures generally followed policy guidance  although measures of health and physical activity were lacking  increased attention to the development of health related performance measures and the data and analysis tools to support them is needed  by assessing the state of the practice and discussing potential approaches  this review informs a stronger and more comprehensive consideration of health within the institutionalized structure of us metropolitan transportation planning  
 considering visual manual tasks performed during highway driving in the context of two different sets of guidelines for embedded in vehicle electronic systems the alliance of automobile manufacturers and the national highway traffic safety administration have each developed a set of guidelines intended to help developers of embedded in vehicle systems minimize the visual demand placed on a driver interacting with the visual manual interface of the system  though based on similar precepts  the guidelines differ in the evaluation methodologies and the criteria used to define safe levels of visual demand  the current study compared the pass fail conclusions from applying the two guidelines  four visual manual tasks were evaluated using two embedded in vehicle systems  volvo sensus  chevrolet mylink  during highway driving  only a preset radio tuning task met the threshold for acceptable visual demand in both guidelines  the pass fail conclusions for three of the four tasks  manual radio tuning  fail   preset radio tuning  pass   easy contact calling  fail   performed using either system were the same for both guidelines  calling a contact with multiple possible numbers using mylink failed both guidelines  and with sensus the task passed the alliance guidelines but not nhtsa s  exploratory analyses suggested that broadening the age range of the participant sample specified in the alliance guidelines beyond 45 65 year olds did not change pass fail conclusions  results from a monte carlo simulation suggested that relying on data from a single trial per the nhtsa guidelines may reduce the repeatability of pass fail conclusions  interestingly  the manual radio tuning task failed to pass both sets of guidelines  even though the organizations used it as a reference task for setting acceptable levels of visual demand  perhaps this indicates that radios have become more difficult to tune than the ones that provided the basis for the guidelines  however  naturalistic driving studies have not indicated increased risk from tuning more modern radios  analysis of glance behavior during naturalistic driving may provide opportunities to further refine the acceptable thresholds for visual demand   c  2017 elsevier ltd  all rights reserved  
 consistent association between hypnotics sedatives and non traffic injuries  results from a national household survey aim  to quantify the relationship between patterns of psychostimulants  hypnotics sedatives and alcohol consumption and the frequency of unintentional non traffic injuries  untis  requiring medical assistant in spain  methods  we carried out a cross sectional study using a randomized pooled sample from two household surveys on psychoactive drugs use  n   51 649 subjects aged 15 64 years   we estimated the magnitude of the association between the use of psychostimulants and hypnotics sedatives in the last 12 months as well as alcohol consumption in the last 30 days with the occurrence of untis in the last 12 months  falls  knocks bumps and cuts  by building several logistic regression models  which took into account the effect of sociodemographic characteristics and the use of other psychoactive drugs  including cannabis   the presence of interactions between age or gender with drug use was also assessed  results  psychostimulants use was associated with a higher frequency of untis  aor   1 24  95 ci 1 03 1 49   the strongest association was found with cuts  aor   1 64  95 ci 1 10 2 43   an association between hypnotics sedatives and untis was also found in each type of injury and was higher with regular use      30 days  than with non regular use    30 days   the age modified the association between hypnotic sedatives and knocks bumps  being higher in the 35 64 years group  aor   2 34  95 ci 1 78 3 06  than in the 15 34 years group  aor   1 59  95 ci 1 14 2 21   regarding alcohol  an increased risk of untis was also observed in all types of untis  even with moderate use  being the association higher for cuts in heavy drinkers  aor   2 41  95 ci 1 63 3 57   conclusions  our results reveal a consistent relationship between hypnotics sedatives and untis  especially in regular users  additional research should apply longitudinal designs to establish causal relationships and to gain an in depth knowledge in this area in order to specific public health interventions  
 constructing a routable retrospective transit timetable from a real time vehicle location feed and gtfs we describe a method for retroactively improving the accuracy of a general transit feed specification  gtfs  package by using a real time vehicle location data set provided by the transit agency  once modified  the gtfs package contains the observed rather than the scheduled transit operations and can be used in research assessing network performance  reliability and accessibility  we offer a case study using data from the toronto transit commission and find that substantial aggregate accessibility differences exist between scheduled and observed services  this  error  in the scheduled gtfs data may have implications for many types of measurements commonly derived from gtfs data  
 constructing the cycling citizen  a critical analysis of policy imagery in brisbane  australia cycling is often promoted as a low cost  accessible and virtuous strategy for solving many urban problems  including air pollution  congestion  climate change and the  obesity epidemic   yet the status of cycling as a quick and easy transport solution available to all is rarely problematised in policy documents  focussing on cycling policy documents in sub tropical brisbane  australia  we apply interpretive policy analysis to identify the ways policy representations of cycling and cyclists may work to exacerbate the marginality of certain groups by excluding them from representation  through analysis of these policy documents  and reference to international research on cycling and the right to the city  this article sketches out the figure of the  cycling citizen  constructed within them  the cycling citizen is characterised in these policy documents by a combination of actions  such as demonstrations of speed and skill   personal attributes  such as body type  clothes and gender  and attitudes  particularly around virtue   we argue that the dominance of representations of mamil  middle aged men in lycra  cyclists in the policy documents analysed may work to make cycling less accessible to those less likely to identify as mamil such as women  people of colour  people with lower incomes  and fat people  and this may effectively exclude them from cycling policy decisions  and negatively shape personal choices about cycling  we further argue that policy representations of cycling and cyclists matter because they have the potential to influence infrastructure and funding decisions which may have material consequences with respect to cycling mode share  equity and safety  
 construction accident narrative classification  an evaluation of text mining techniques learning from past accidents is fundamental to accident prevention  thus  accident and near miss reporting are encouraged by organizations and regulators  however  for organizations managing large safety databases  the time taken to accurately classify accident and near miss narratives will be very significant  this study aims to evaluate the utility of various text mining classification techniques in classifying 1000 publicly available construction accident narratives obtained from the us osha website  the study evaluated six machine learning algorithms  including support vector machine  svm   linear regression  lr   random forest  rf   k nearest neighbor  knn   decision tree  dt  and naive bayes  nb   and found that svm produced the best performance in classifying the test set of 251 cases  further experimentation with tokenization of the processed text and non linear svm were also conducted  in addition  a grid search was conducted on the hyperparameters of the svm models  it was found that the best performing classifiers were linear svm with unigram tokenization and radial basis function  rbf  svm with uni gram tokenization  in view of its relative simplicity  the linear svm is recommended  across the 11 labels of accident causes or types  the precision of the linear svm ranged from 0 5 to 1  recall ranged from 0 36 to 0 9 and fl score was between 0 45 and 0 92  the reasons for misclassification were discussed and suggestions on ways to improve the performance were provided  
 construction cost estimation  a parametric approach for better estimates of expected cost and variation as project planners continue to move towards frameworks such as probabilistic life cycle cost analysis to evaluate competing transportation investments  there is a need to enhance the current cost estimation approaches that underlie these models to enable improved project selection  this paper presents an approach for cost estimation that combines a maximum likelihood estimator for data transformations with least angle regression for dimensionality reduction  the authors apply the proposed method for 15 different pavement bid items across five states in the united states  the results from the study demonstrate that the proposed approach frequently leads to consistent parametric estimates that address the structural bias and heteroscedasticity that plague the current cost estimation procedures  both of these aspects are particularly important for large scale construction projects  where traditional methods tend to systematically underestimate expected construction costs and overestimate the associated variance   c  2017 elsevier ltd  all rights reserved  
 contested spaces and subjectivities of transit  political ecology of a bus rapid transit development in oakland  california in this paper we argue that political ecology  a critical subdiscipline of geography  can contribute important insights for transportation geographers and planners  specifically  political ecology s attendance to environmental subjectivities helps explain why some groups traditionally assumed to be in favor of mass transit resist the projects developed in part to benefit them  based on qualitative research conducted in oakland  california between 2011 and 2012  this paper ultimately argues that a political ecology lens helps highlight how environmental and transit subjectivities identities developed from everyday interactions with mobile and built environments shape dispositions towards  and the politics around  mass transit projects  this insight is important as it reveals how interactions with the built environment  and the subjectivities these interactions engender  can be overlooked in the context of transportation interventions  especially when these subjectivities are in tension with transit planners  working assumptions and worldviews  
 context aware system for pre triggering irreversible vehicle safety actuators new vehicle safety systems have led to a steady improvement of road safety and a reduction in the risk of suffering a major injury in vehicle accidents  a huge leap forward in the development of new vehicle safety systems are actuators that have to be activated irreversibly shortly before a collision in order to mitigate accident consequences  the triggering decision has to be based on measurements of exteroceptive sensors currently used in driver assistance systems  this paper focuses on developing a novel context aware system designed to detect potential collisions and to trigger safety actuators even before an accident occurs  in this context  the analysis examines the information that can be collected from exteroceptive sensors  pre crash data  to predict a certain collision and its severity to decide whether a triggering is entitled or not  a five layer context aware architecture is presented  that is able to collect contextual information about the vehicle environment and the actual driving state using different sensors  to perform reasoning about potential collisions  and to trigger safety functions upon that information  accident analysis is used in a data model to represent uncertain knowledge and to perform reasoning  a simulation concept based on real accident data is introduced to evaluate the presented system concept   c  2017 elsevier ltd  all rights reserved  
 context sensitive  first principles approach to bicycle speed estimation bicycle speed estimation is important for geometric design  traffic signal operations  microsimulation models  and health and safety assessment  among other applications  bicycle speeds can vary greatly with the characteristics and power output of the rider and with travel conditions  especially road grade  this study presents a mathematical framework to address the non trivial and practical problem of estimating bicycle free flow speeds in a way that is sensitive to cyclist and roadway attributes  a closed expression is derived from first principles to determine speed from bicyclist power output  the method is extended to the problem of speed estimation for bicycles with limited gearing  results are consistent with speed surveys in the literature  application of the method to clearance interval calculation demonstrates the importance of context sensitive bicycle speed estimation for advanced traffic signal systems  
 contributors to young drivers  driving styles   a comparison between israel and queensland among the numerous factors that contribute to young novice drivers  driving styles  personality characteristics  sociodemographic variables  family atmosphere  and friends  norms are known to have an important impact  however  cross cultural comparisons are relatively rare in the safety literature concerning young drivers  this study aimed at comparing young drivers from israel and queensland  australia  and examining the contribution of personality  sociodemographic  family and friends  aspects to their driving styles  reckless and careless  hostile and angry  anxious  patient and careful   more specifically  this study examined the associations between young drivers  driving style and their perceptions of separation individuation  the family climate for road safety  and the safe driving climate among friends  we also examined sociodemographic and driving history variables such as gender  the marital status of parents  and personal exposure to traffic crashes  the study consisted of two samples of male and female young drivers  age 17 22  from israel  n   160  and queensland  n   160   who completed a set of valid and reliable self report questionnaires  findings indicate that in general  maladaptive driving styles are associated with lower family tendency to engage in promoting road safety  higher pressure and costs of driving with peers  and unhealthier separation individuation aspects  the opposite is observed for the patient and careful driving style that relates to higher engagement of the family in road safety  lower pressure from friends  and healthier separation individuation  some differences were found regarding specific styles between the two samples  in addition  women scored lower than men in the reckless and careless style  and higher  in the israeli sample  in the anxious as well as the patient and careful styles  overall  similarities in the associations between the study variables in the samples exceed the differences  and the importance of examining variables on multi levels when referring to young drivers  driving styles  is confirmed  the findings attest to the universal utility of the mdsi  together with the understanding that only a wider examination of personal and environmental contributors enables true insights into the complex behavior of driving among young drivers  
 convergence in transportation measures across the eu 15 this is the first study in the literature to investigate the convergence in transportation measures  to this end  we conjectured a transportation convergence equation and tested it via difference gmm and system gmm methods  using 4 year span panel data from 15 european union countries  eu 15  for the period 1970 2013  the results provide strong evidence for the existence of unconditional convergence among the eu 15 countries in two transportation measures  namely  inland freight transportation per capita  and inland passenger transportation per capita  the estimates show that the convergence is even stronger when control variables are used  we conclude that the income convergence of eu 15 in the process of economic integration is also strongly evident in the transportation sector  
 cooperative management in full truckload and less than truckload vehicle system in cooperative logistics  shippers can cooperate to improve efficiency and reduce the cost of product package delivery services  in this paper  we consider the resource  i e   vehicles  sharing problem to serve customers in the cooperative logistics environment  in the environment  small shippers cooperate by forming a coalition to create a vehicle pool and to allow sharing of their own vehicles with each other  the vehicles in the pool are used to deliver packages to customers  to minimize the delivery cost to the shippers  we propose a framework for the capacitated vehicle routing problem with time windows  the framework is composed of joint vehicle allocation  cost management  and overlapping coalition formation among shippers  for vehicle allocation  we formulate and solve optimization models to determine the number of vehicles and their delivery routes to meet customer demand and service time  the uncertainty of customer demand is taken into consideration  for sharing the delivery cost generated in the vehicle pool  i e   cost management  among the cooperative shippers in a coalition  we apply the concept of myerson value from the cooperative game theory as a solution  based on the cost  the shippers then decide whether to cooperate and share the vehicles or not  the performance evaluation based on the test and actual road networks clearly shows the benefits of the proposed framework  
 coordinated optimisation problem integrating emu circulation and timetabling for high speed railway in this study  the problem of electric multiple unit  emu  circulation planning and train timetabling is studied through a coordinated process that provides a feedback mechanism to simultaneously minimise the number of emus  the number of emu maintenance tasks and the train travel time  based on an adjustable train departure time window as the key parameter in the problem  the approach mainly consists of two components  a column generation process  which searches for better emu circulation routes  and a mathematical model  which produces timetables  these components interact according to the results of computational assessments until the solution reaches a certain level of optimality or the allotted computation time is exhausted  finally  the authors test this approach using a small example to illustrate the effectiveness  and they also study a real world case  a quantitative comparative analysis shows that long travel distances and travel times of trains significantly affect the number of emus used  the results indicate that the proposed model and algorithm can effectively address the coordinated optimisation problem of integrating emu circulation planning and timetabling

 correlations between road crash mortality rate and distance to trauma centers the assumption that better outcomes are associated with a reduction in time to trauma care is the foundation of emergency medical services and trauma systems  however  previous literatures did not provide clear evidence to directly support the assumption  in this study  the data of fatality analysis reporting system from 2010 to 2015 were adopted to quantify the relationship between the distance to trauma centers and the mortality of patients in fatal crashes  utilizing the closest facility solver in the geographic information system  the distance from crash scene to trauma center was calculated  and the effects of trauma center on patients in fatal crashes and the difference between different levels of trauma center were examined using logistic regression  for all drivers in fatal crashes from 2010 to 2015  the results of logistic regression show that the mortality increased with each additional mile to the trauma center with the odds ratio  or  of 1 0021 per mile  comparing to an or of 1 0008 per mile for the passengers in fatal crashes  the level i  ii  and iii trauma centers had different effects on the driver mortality with a chi square of 1163 8  468 7  and 112 2 respectively  indicating that the drivers admitted to level i trauma centers had improved survival rates relative to lower level trauma centers  
 cost and time damping  evidence from aggregate rail direct demand models there is a significant body of evidence from both disaggregate choice modelling literature and practical travel demand forecasting that the responsiveness to cost and possibly to time diminishes with journey length  this has  in britain at least  been termed  cost damping   and is recognised in guidance issued by the uk department for transport  however  the consistency of the effect across modes and data types has not been established  cost damping  if it exists  affects both the forecasting of demand and our understanding of behaviour  this paper aims to investigate the evidence for cost and time damping in rail demand using aggregate rail ticket sales data  the rail ticket sales data in britain has  for many years  formed the basis of analysis of a wide range of impacts of rail demand  it records the number of tickets sold between station pairs  and it is generally felt to provide a reasonably accurate reflection of travel demand  however  the consistency of these direct demand models with choice modelling and highway demand model structures has not been investigated  rail direct demand models estimated by ticket sales data indicate only slight variation in the fare elasticity with distance  as is evidenced in the largest meta analysis of price elasticities conducted to date  wardman in j transp econ policy 48 3  367 384  2014   this study of uk elasticities shows strong variation between urban and inter urban trips  presumably a segmentation at least in part by purpose  but less remaining variation by trip length  a lack of variation by length supports the hypothesis of cost damping  because constant cost sensitivity would imply that fare elasticity would increase strongly with distance  because of the increasing impact of higher fares at longer distances  in this paper we indicate that rail direct demand models have some consistency of behavioural paradigm with utility based choice models used in highway planning  we go on to use rail demand data to estimate time and fare elasticities in the context of various cost damping functions  our empirical contribution is to estimate time elasticities on a basis directly comparable with cost elasticities and to show that the phenomenon of cost damping is strongly present in ticket sales data  this finding implies that cost damping should be included in models intended for multimodal analysis  which may otherwise give incorrect predictions  
 cost functions and determinants of unit cost effects in horizontal airline m as this paper analyses the unit cost effects of mergers and acquisitions  m as  using linear  quadratic  and translog cost functions  in addition to a basic unit cost model we specify separate models for distress  profit  relative size  and cost difference  among the merging firms  we use a sample of 19 horizontal m as in the international airline industry and data spanning from 1980 to 2012  our models show that m as do not affect unit costs in a significant way  unless the relative size difference of the merging firms is large  in which case we detect an increase in unit costs   c  2017 elsevier ltd  all rights reserved  
 cost efficiency of buses using stochastic frontier analysis the cost efficiency of public transport systems is a helpful measure for regulators to establish an effective subsidy mechanism  this study presents a cost efficiency measurement model of bus routes based on stochastic frontier analysis  taking into account not only heterogeneous outputs but also operating environment factors  in addition  four new operating environment factors that can affect the efficiency of bus routes are introduced  an empirical analysis  based on 39 routes operating in jiangyin city  china  is presented  it was found that vehicle kilometres have a bigger impact on total operating costs than other parameters such as fixed inputs and fuel price  operating environment factors such as average bus stop density and the percentage of bus lanes have significant influences on cost inefficiency differentials  furthermore  the measurement of cost efficiency enables identification of the difference between actual total operating costs and efficient total operating costs at a bus route level  the proposed approach could support regulators in setting reasonable cost benchmarks based on efficient total operating costs

 counterfactual simulations applied to shrp2 crashes  the effect of driver behavior models on safety benefit estimations of intelligent safety systems as the development and deployment of in vehicle intelligent safety systems  iss  for crash avoidance and mitigation have rapidly increased in the last decades  the need to evaluate their prospective safety benefits before introduction has never been higher  counterfactual simulations using relevant mathematical models  for vehicle dynamics  sensors  the environment  iss algorithms  and models of driver behavior  have been identified as having high potential  however  although most of these models are relatively mature  models of driver behavior in the critical seconds before a crash are still relatively immature  there are also large conceptual differences between different driver models  the objective of this paper is  firstly  to demonstrate the importance of the choice of driver model when counterfactual simulations are used to evaluate two iss  forward collision warning  fcw   and autonomous emergency braking  aeb   secondly  the paper demonstrates how counterfactual simulations can be used to perform sensitivity analyses on parameter settings  both for driver behavior and iss algorithms  finally  the paper evaluates the effect of the choice of glance distribution in the driver behavior model on the safety benefit estimation  the paper uses pre crash kinematics and driver behavior from 34 rear end crashes from the shrp2 naturalistic driving study for the demonstrations  the results for fcw show a large difference in the percent of avoided crashes between conceptually different models of driver behavior  while differences were small for conceptually similar models  as expected  the choice of model of driver behavior did not affect aeb benefit much  based on our results  researchers and others who aim to evaluate iss with the driver in the loop through counterfactual simulations should be sure to make deliberate and well grounded choices of driver models  the choice of model matters   c  2017 elsevier ltd  all rights reserved  
 crane allocation with stability considerations crane planning in a container terminal is a major concern for terminal operators  crane scheduling has an enormous impact on port efficiency and profitability  and these activities have  therefore  received high priority from terminal managers and researchers  owing to the complex structure of the problem with numerous constraints and practical issues  terminal managers have been calling for a decision support tool which provides efficient and functional solutions  however  no main solution has yet emerged for the problem  this article proposes a decision support system  dss  for solving complex crane scheduling problems in a container terminal  offering solutions that consider contextual issues such as crane crossing restrictions and dynamic crane assignment policy  and further addresses an additional consideration during vessel unloading  vessel stability  to show the practical application of the dss  we conducted a case study using real ship data at the izmir container terminal in turkey  the effect of stability on the outcomes has been shown through additional experiments  our findings reveal that the theoretical makespan can be reduced by 20 per cent during real life operations because of stability limitations  
 crash risk factors for interstate large trucks in north carolina introduction  provide an updated examination of risk factors for large truck involvements in crashes resulting in injury or death  methods  a matched case control study was conducted in north carolina of large trucks operated by interstate carriers  cases were defined as trucks involved in crashes resulting in fatal or non fatal injury  and one control truck was matched on the basis of location  weekday  time of day  and truck type  the matched pair odds ratio provided an estimate of the effect of various driver  vehicle  or carrier factors  results  out of service  oos  brake violations tripled the risk of crashing  any oos vehicle defect increased crash risk by 362   higher historical crash rates  fatal  injury  or all crashes  of the carrier were associated with increased risk of crashing  operating on a short haul exemption increased crash risk by 383   antilock braking systems reduced crash risk by 65   all of these results were statistically significant at the 95  confidence level  other safety technologies also showed estimated benefits  although not statistically significant  conclusions  with the exception of the finding that short haul exemption is associated with increased crash risk  results largely bolster what is currently known about large truck crash risk and reinforce current enforcement practices  results also suggest vehicle safety technologies can be important in lowering crash risk  this means that as safety technology continues to penetrate the fleet  whether from voluntary usage or government mandates  reductions in large truck crashes may be achieved  practical application  results imply that increased enforcement and use of crash avoidance technologies can improve the large truck crash problem   c  2017 national safety council and elsevier ltd  all rights reserved  
 crash risk  how cycling flow can help explain crash data crash databases are commonly queried to infer crash causation  prioritize countermeasures to prevent crashes  and evaluate safety systems  however  crash databases  which may be compiled from police and hospital records  alone cannot provide estimates of crash risk  moreover  they fail to capture road user behavior before the crash  in sweden  as in many other countries  crash databases are particularly sterile when it comes to bicycle crashes  in fact  not only are bicycle crashes underreported in police reports  they are also poorly documented in hospital reports  nevertheless  these reports are irreplaceable sources of information  clearly highlighting the surprising prevalence of single bicycle crashes and hinting at some cyclist behaviors  such as alcohol consumption  that may increase crash risk  in this study  we used exposure data from 11 roadside stations measuring cyclist flow in gothenburg to help explain crash data and estimate risk  for instance  our results show that crash risk is greatest at night on weekends  and that this risk is larger for single bicycle crashes than for crashes between a cyclist and another motorist  this result suggests that the population of night cyclists on weekend nights is particularly prone to specific crash types  which may be influenced by specific contributing factors  such as alcohol   and may require specific countermeasures  most importantly  our results demonstrate that detailed exposure data can help select  filter  aggregate  highlight  and normalize crash data to obtain a sharper view of the cycling safety problem  to achieve a more fine tuned intervention   c  2016 elsevier ltd  all rights reserved  
 crashes involving cyclists aged 50 and over in in depth study the netherlands  an in depth study the number of seriously injured cyclists is increasing in the netherlands  the majority of these seriously injured cyclists were involved in single bicycle or bicycle bicycle crashes  little is known about the circumstances in which these crashes occur  as the police only registers 4  of these crashes  therefore  an in depth study was carried out to gain insight into the factors and circumstances that influence the occurrence and consequences of these crashes  the focus was on crashes involving cyclists aged 50 and over  as this group has a large share in the number of cyclist only crashes  detailed information on 41 single bicycle and bicycle bicycle crashes was collected and analysed  this resulted in a description of the course of events for every analysed crash  including a list of factors that had contributed to the occurrence of the crash and possible injuries  subsequently  crashes with a similar course of events and a comparable combination of contributory factors were grouped into types of crashes  results showed that cyclists aged 75 and over are more often involved in falls from a bicycle than younger cyclists  contributory factors that played a role in a large number of crashes were behaviour of another road user  distraction and narrow cycling facilities or traffic lanes  however  which factors played a role in the occurrence of a crash depended on the type of crash  eight types of crashes were identified  based on the factors that played a role in the occurrence of these crashes  remedial measures can be developed to prevent similar crashes from occurring in the future   c  2016 elsevier ltd  all rights reserved  
 crew allocation system for the masonry industry masonry construction is labor intensive  processes require a large number of crews made up of masons with diverse skills  capabilities  and personalities  often crews are reassembled and the superintendent in the site is responsible for allocating crews to balance between the complexity of the job and the need for quality and high production rates  however  the masonry industry still faces increased time and low productivity rates that result from inefficiencies in crew allocation  this article presents a system for efficient crew allocation in the masonry industry formulated as a mixed integer program  the system takes into consideration characteristics of masons and site conditions and how to relate these to determine the right crew for the right wall to increase productivity  with the system  superintendents are not only able to identify working patterns for each of the masons but also optimal crew formation  completion times  and labor costs  to validate the model  data from a real project in the united states is used to compare the crew allocation completed by the superintendent onsite with the one proposed by the system  the results showed that relating characteristics of workers with site conditions had a substantial impact on reducing the completion time to build the walls  maximizing the utilization of masons  and outlining opportunities for concurrent work  
 cross border residential mobility  quality of life and modal shift  a luxembourg case study it is argued in the life oriented approach that travel behavior affects life choice and vice versa with resulting impacts on quality of life  qol   by deepening the analysis of interdependences between daily mobility and life event  relocation  and their relationships with qol  this article focuses on two challenges  it aims at analyzing how these life events first  encourage travel behavior changes  especially mode choice  and second  improve or decrease people s qol  by radically changing living context and built environment  relocation also affects routine and satisfaction  these relationships are investigated in the luxembourg cross border area  where great differences related to real estate price encourage residential moves from luxembourg to neighboring countries  while the general decline in public transport efficiency at the border may support car use  we use both mixed and ordered logit models  the first one investigates whether individuals  life stage changes and residential relocation are significant regarding their mode choice decision  the second estimates individuals  global qol and the roles of complementary factors  changing housing conditions  built environment  subjective satisfaction  travel time and socio economic characteristics   the analysis reveals several results  the effect of the different factors is consistent with travel mode choice literature despite the specific cross border context  nevertheless  relocation  mainly oriented towards a cross border suburbanization  significantly increases the probability of using the car for daily activities  these trips and especially the journeys to work are the least satisfactory aspects of daily life after relocation but does not affect the general level of qol  at the opposite  the better housing conditions after relocation have positive effect on the qol  from a policy perspective  this life oriented approach in cross border context confirms the influence of life events on qol while it demonstrates a higher importance of housing conditions than spatial constraints on relocation and satisfaction   c  2017 elsevier ltd  all rights reserved

 cross comparison of three surrogate safety methods to diagnose cyclist safety problems at intersections in norway relying on accident records as the main data source for studying cyclists  safety has many drawbacks  such as high degree of under reporting  the lack of accident details and particularly of information about the interaction processes that led to the accident  it is also an ethical problem as one has to wait for accidents to happen in order to make a statement about cyclists   un  safety  in this perspective  the use of surrogate safety measures based on actual observations in traffic is very promising  in this study we used video data from three intersections in norway that were all independently analysed using three methods  the swedish traffic conflict technique  swedish tct   the dutch conflict technique  doctor  and the probabilistic surrogate measures of safety  psms  technique developed in canada  the first two methods are based on manual detection and counting of critical events in traffic  traffic conflicts   while the third considers probabilities of multiple trajectories for each interaction and delivers a density map of potential collision points per site  due to extensive use of microscopic data  psms technique relies heavily on automated tracking of the road users in video  across the three sites  the methods show similarities or are at least  compatible  with the accident records  the two conflict techniques agree quite well for the number  type and location of conflicts  but some differences with no obvious explanation are also found  psms reports many more safety relevant interactions including less severe events  the location of the potential collision points is compatible with what the conflict techniques suggest  but the possibly significant share of false alarms due to inaccurate trajectories extracted from video complicates the cdmparison  the tested techniques still require enhancement  with respect to better adjustment to analysis of the situations involving cyclists  and vulnerable road users in general  and further validation  however  we believe this to be a future direction for the road safety analysis as the number of accidents is constantly decreasing and the quality of accident data does not seem to improve   c  2016 elsevier ltd  all rights reserved  
 crossing the road in time  inequalities in older people s walking speeds pedestrian crossings in the uk and us require people to walk at 1 2 m s to cross the road in time  however a large proportion of older people do not walk this fast  potentially discouraging walking or putting older people at risk of injury  we use longitudinal data to investigate changes in walking speed  and ability to cross the road in time  at older ages  31 015 walking speed measurements were taken from 10 249 men and women aged 60  years in waves 1 7 of the english longitudinal study of ageing  2002 2014   growth curve analyses were used to model how walking speed changes with increasing age  and predicted probabilities of being able to cross the road in time were estimated  10  of measured walking speeds were fast enough to cross the road in time  walking speed declined with age   5 7 x 10  3 m s yr  95  ci  7 6 x 10  3    3 9 x 10  3     and the decline accelerated with increasing age   03 x 10  3 m s yr   0 4 x 10  3    0 3 x 10  3     female  less wealthy and less healthy older people had slower walking speeds  for instance  predicted probability of crossing the road in time at age 60 was 14 8   10 1  18 5  and 2 7   1 5  3 8  for the richest and poorest men and 8 4   6 0  1 1  and 1 5   0 9  2 2  for the richest and poorest women  and at age 80 they were 7 1   3 6  10 5  and 1 0   0 3  1 7  for the richest and poorest men and 3 7   1 6  5 9  and 0 5   0 1  0 9  for the richest and poorest women  most older people do not walk fast enough to cross the road in time  even the majority of the wealthiest and healthiest people aged 60 years and older do not walk fast enough to cross pedestrian crossings in the allocated time  crossing times should be increased to allow for older peoples  slower walking speeds or other policies considered to improve walkability  and to help avoid injuries and social isolation   c  2017 the authors  published by elsevier ltd

 cruising for parking around a circle several recent papers have used the approximation that the number of curbside parking spaces searched before finding a vacant space equals the reciprocal of the expected curbside vacancy rate  the implied expected cruising for parking times are significantly lower than those that have been obtained through observation and simulation  through computer simulation of cars cruising for parking around a circle in stochastic steady state  this paper shows that the approximation leads to underestimation of expected cruising for parking time and  at high occupancy rates  considerable underestimation  the paper also identifies several  effects  that contribute to the approximation being an increasingly poor one as the occupancy rate increases   c  2017 published by elsevier ltd  
 cultural predictors of future intention to drive under the influence of cannabis  duic  this study examines the influence that traffic safety culture has on the intention to drive under the influence of cannabis  duic  in the next six months  here  traffic safety culture is defined as  the values and beliefs shared among groups of road users and stakeholders that influence their decisions to behave in ways that improve traffic safety   to operationalize this definition  a 14 item survey was developed with a binary response format  yes  no  based on a behavioral model predicting intentional duic  the sampling plan collected data from drivers at the roadside with the goal of obtaining a friday daytime and weekend nighttime sample representative of drivers across washington state  n   416   the results showed only a small percentage of randomly surveyed drivers in washington state reported future intention to duic  45 416   11    the intention of this small group could be reliably predicted based on certain aspects of their shared culture  notably  drivers who shared the attitude that duic is enjoyable were 3 5 times more likely to report the intention to duic in the next six months  conversely  drivers who shared the belief that cannabis impairs performance and the injunctive norm that people important to them would be disappointed were more than twice as likely not to report future intention to duic  interestingly  the possession of a medical card for cannabis treatment influenced the effects of culture on duic intention  the results of this study suggest that strategies that can change duic culture amongst at risk drivers may be effective in reducing such behaviors   c  2017 elsevier ltd  all rights reserved

 cycling and disability  a call for further research cycling can offer health benefits  and these benefits are relevant for disabled people  few disabled people cycle  and disability is under researched in cycling studies  this paper  i  reviews current research into disabled cycling  and provides a critique of inclusive cycle design guidance  and  ii  reports on a recent study which highlights some of the significant issues faced by disabled cyclists in accessing cycle infrastructure and using designated cycle networks  a semi structured focus group was conducted with eight inclusive cycle scheme users  seven care providers supporting the majority of the cyclists  and the scheme organiser  we conclude that the needs of disabled cyclists are increasingly being taken into consideration in infrastructure design guidance  but there are many issues to be resolved before cycling is accessible to and usable by disabled people  there is little research on understanding the experiences of disabled cyclists  and hence there is a knowledge gap concerning the efficacy of current design guidance  the data presented in this paper provide a useful first insight into the experiences of a group of disabled cyclists  but these data are limited to the specific context of that group  further research is needed   c  2017 elsevier ltd all rights reserved  
 cycling on the extensive and intensive margin  the role of paths and prices drawing on a panel of german survey data spanning 1999 2013  this paper identifies the correlates of non recreational bicycling  focusing specifically on the roles of bicycle paths and fuel prices  our approach conceptualizes ridership as a two stage decision process comprising the discrete choice of whether to use the bike  i e  the intensive margin  and the continuous choice of how far to ride  i e  the extensive margin   to the extent that these two choices are related and  moreover  potentially influenced by factors unobservable to the researcher  we explore alternative estimators using two stage censored regression techniques to assess whether the results are subject to biases from sample selectivity  a key finding is that while higher fuel costs are associated with an increased probability of undertaking non recreational bike trips  this effect is of a significantly higher magnitude among those residing in an urbanized region  we also find evidence for a positive association with the extent of bike paths  both in increasing the probability of non recreational bike travel  as well as the distance traveled   c  2017 elsevier ltd  all rights reserved  
 cyclist  safety perceptions of cycling infrastructure at un signalised intersections  cross sectional survey of queensland cyclists previous research suggests that cyclists  perceptions of the safety of cycling infrastructure influences their desire to ride on that infrastructure  cycling infrastructure includes both cycling facilities and cycling supportive road treatments  while researchers have previously examined the safety perceptions of cycling infrastructure on midblock road sections  little is known about the safety perceptions of cycling infrastructure at intersections  the aim of this study was to investigate which types of cycling infrastructure do cyclists perceive to be the safest at un signalised intersections  this study was conducted in queensland  australia  adult members of bicycle organisations  n 214  completed an online survey about their demographic characteristics  cycling habits  previous near miss or collision experiences while cycling  and safety perceptions of cycling infrastructure at intersections  general linear mixed modelling was used to examine associations between safety perceptions and 12 types of cycling infrastructure at three different motorist cyclist interaction scenarios  off road bicycle paths and footpaths were perceived to be the safest cycling infrastructure at unsignalised intersections  p   0 05   while cycling through an intersection  participants were more concerned about being sideswiped than being struck directly at the side by a motorist  p  0 05   the findings suggest that cyclists  safety perceptions of cycling infrastructure at un signalised intersections are associated with motorists  yielding behaviour towards cyclists  cyclists felt safer using cycling infrastructure where they had to give way to turning motorists at the intersection than using cycling infrastructure where they had the right of way  by doing so  cyclists can decide whether or not it is safe to cross the intersection rather than worry about turning motorists who could be attempting to outrace them  in practice  assessing motorists  behaviours and attitudes towards cyclists should be considered before designing and implementing cycling infrastructure at intersections   c  2017 elsevier ltd all rights reserved  
 cyclists as a minority group  in the social sciences  several definitions of minority group can be found  the definitions include different aspects such as power status  number  distinctiveness  social category  group context  dispositions  and discrimination  compared to motorized road users  cyclists are considered vulnerable road users because they lack physical protection  we argue that such definition does not capture the social and cultural aspects that characterize the membership within the group of cyclists  we offer arguments and reflections based on recent literature advocating that cyclists may share some features of the experience of minority groups  although cyclists differ from other minorities in important respects  they manifest many of the characteristics by which minority groups are defined   c  2017 elsevier ltd  all rights reserved  
 data driven fuel consumption estimation  a multivariate adaptive regression spline approach providing guidance and information to drivers to help them make fuel efficient route choices remains an important and effective strategy in the near term to reduce fuel consumption from the transportation sector  one key component in implementing this strategy is a fuel consumption estimation model  in this paper  we developed a mesoscopic fuel consumption estimation model that can be implemented into an eco routing system  our proposed model presents a framework that utilizes large scale  real world driving data  clusters road links by free flow speed and fits one statistical model for each of cluster  this model includes predicting variables that were rarely or never considered before  such as free flow speed and number of lanes  we applied the model to a real world driving data set based on a global positioning system travel survey in the philadelphia camden trenton metropolitan area  results from the statistical analyses indicate that the independent variables we chose influence the fuel consumption rates of vehicles  but the magnitude and direction of the influences are dependent on the type of road links  specifically free flow speeds of links  a statistical diagnostic is conducted to ensure the validity of the models and results  although the real world driving data we used to develop statistical relationships are specific to one region  the framework we developed can be easily adjusted and used to explore the fuel consumption relationship in other regions   c  2017 elsevier ltd  all rights reserved  
 data enabled stochastic modeling for evaluating schedule robustness of railway networks this paper evaluates the robustness of a railway network with respect to operational delays  it assumes that trains in the network operate on fixed routes and with reference to a timetable  a stochastic delay propagation model is proposed for identifying primary  externally imposed  delays and for computing the resultant secondary  knock on  delays  delay probability distributions are computed for each train at each station on its journey  using timetable and infrastructure data for identifying potential station resource conflicts with other trains  the delay predictions are used to evaluate schedule robustness using two newly proposed metrics  individual robustness measures the ability of trains to limit the adverse effects of their own primary delays  on the other hand  collective robustness measures the ability of the network as a whole  to limit the knock on effects of primary delays imposed on a small fraction of trains  the two metrics provide stochastic guarantees on the punctuality of trains when the published schedule is put in operation  the applicability of the proposed methodology is validated using empirical data from a portion of the indian railways network  containing more than 38 000 train arrival departure records  while a railway network is used as a case study  the same ideas can be applied to any scheduled transportation network  
 decomposing passenger transport futures  comparing results of global integrated assessment models the transport sector is growing fast in terms of energy use and accompanying greenhouse gas emissions  integrated assessment models  iams  are used widely to analyze energy system transitions over a decadal time frame to help inform and evaluating international climate policy  as part of this  iams also explore pathways of decarbonizing the transport sector  this study quantifies the contribution of changes in activity growth  modal structure  energy intensity and fuel mix to the projected passenger transport carbon emission pathways  the laspeyres index decomposition method is used to compare results across models and scenarios  and against historical transport trends  broadly speaking the models show similar trends  projecting continuous transport activity growth  reduced energy intensity and in some cases modal shift to carbon intensive modes   similar to those observed historically in a business as usual scenario  in policy induced mitigation scenarios further enhancements of energy efficiency and fuel switching is seen  showing a clear break with historical trends  reduced activity growth and modal shift  towards less carbon intensive modes  only have a limited contribution to emission reduction  measures that could induce such changes could possibly complement the aggressive  technology switch required in the current scenarios to reach internationally agreed climate targets   c  2016 published by elsevier ltd

 definition of wind blowers for vehicles testing at chassis dyno facilities using a cfd approach the need to increase measurement accuracy of fuel consumption and pollutant emissions in vehicles is forcing the market to develop chassis dyno test cells that reproduce on road conditions realistically  air cooling is key to vehicle performance  it is therefore critical that the design of a test cell guarantees realistic cooling of all vehicle components  as important errors in fuel consumption and emissions measurements may otherwise arise  in a test room  a blower placed in front of the vehicle supplies the cooling air  while there are some guidelines in the literature for the selection of fans required for emissions measurements for standard driving cycles  the information for designing the air supply system for specific tests in other areas is scarce  new real driving emissions  rde  legislation will force manufacturers to perform on road measurements of pollutants  this represents a significant challenge due to the variability of conditions coming from non controlled parameters  in order to optimize vehicles  different tests are performed in cells equipped with a chassis dyno where the on road flow field around the vehicle is reproduced as closely as possible  this work provides some guidelines for the definition of the airflow supply system of chassis dyno facilities for vehicle optimization tests  based on a cfd analysis of the flow characteristics around the vehicle  by comparison with the solution obtained for a vehicle in real road driving conditions  the exit section of the blower and the distance between the blower exit and the car that best reproduce realistic on road flow conditions in a test room are determined   c  2017 elsevier ltd  all rights reserved  
 delay or forgo  a closer look at youth driver licensing trends in the united states and australia in recent years a rapidly expanding body of literature has attempted to understand reductions in the rate of driver licensing among young adults in developed countries  an unanswered question emerging from this literature has been whether young adults are truly turning their back on the car  or simply delaying the inevitable transition to a car dependent lifestyle  this viewpoint paper will present some of the only evidence available that directly addresses this crucial question and discuss the implications of forgoing versus delaying car licensing  this discussion is couched within the theoretical framework of socio technical transition research  changes in youth driver licensing are putting pressure on the prevailing socio technical regime of car dominance  providing a window of opportunity for niche innovations to destabilise and reform this regime  however  this trend must be supported by policy and planning if it is to continue  
 delayed purchase options in single leg revenue management many airline reservation systems offer the commitment option to their potential passengers  this option allows passengers to reserve a seat for a fixed duration before making a final purchase decision  in this study  we develop single leg revenue management models that consider such contingent commitment decisions  we start with a dynamic programming model of this problem  this model is computationally intractable as it requires storing a multidimensional state space because of bookkeeping of the committed seats  to alleviate this difficulty  we propose an alternate dynamic programming formulation that uses an approximate model of how the contingent commitments behave and we show how to extract a capacity allocation policy from the approximate dynamic programming formulation  in addition  we present a deterministic linear programming model that gives an upper bound on the optimal expected revenue from the intractable dynamic programming model  as the problem size becomes large in terms of flight capacity and the expected number of arrivals  we demonstrate an asymptotic lower bound for the deterministic linear programming model  our extensive numerical study indicates that offering commitment options can noticeably increase potential revenue even though offering a contingent commitment option may not always be in the best interest of the airline  also  our results show that the proposed approximate dynamic programming model coordinates capacity allocation and commitment decisions quite well  
 design and modeling of a crowdsource enabled system for urban parcel relay and delivery this paper proposes a crowdsource enabled system for urban parcel relay and delivery  we consider cyclists and pedestrians as crowdsources who are close to customers and interested in relaying parcels with a truck carrier and undertaking jobs for the last leg parcel delivery and the first leg parcel pickup  the crowdsources express their interests in doing so by submitting bids to the truck carrier  the truck carrier then selects bids and coordinates crowdsources  last leg delivery  first leg pickup  with its truck operations  the truck carrier s problem is formulated as a mixed integer non linear program which simultaneously i  selects crowdsources to complete the last leg delivery  first leg pickup  between customers and selected points for crowdsource truck relay  and ii  determines the relay points and truck routes and schedule  to solve the truck carrier problem  we first decompose the problem into a winner determination problem and a simultaneous pickup and delivery problem with soft time windows  and propose a tabu search based algorithm to iteratively solve the two subproblems  numerical results show that this solution approach is able to yield close to optimum solutions with much less time than using off the shelf solvers  by adopting this new system  truck vehicle miles traveled  vmt  and total cost can be reduced compared to pure truck delivery  the advantage of the system over pure truck delivery is sensitive to factors such as penalty for servicing outside customers  desired time windows  truck unit operating cost  time value of crowdsources  and the crowdsource mode   c  2017 elsevier ltd  all rights reserved  
 design of energy efficient timetables in two way railway rapid transit lines a methodology to design energy efficient timetables in rapid railway transit networks is presented  using an empirical description of the train energy consumption as a function of running times  the timetable design problem is modelled as a mixed integer non linear optimization problem  minlp  for a complete two way line  in doing so  all the services in both directions along a certain planning horizon are considered while attending a known passengers  demand  the minlp formulation  which depends on train loads  is fully linearised supposing train loads are fixed  a sequential mixed integer linear solving procedure is then used to solve the timetabling optimization problem with unknown train loads  the proposed methodology emphasizes the need of considering all the services running during the planning horizon when designing energy efficient timetables  as consequence of the relationship among train speeds  frequency and fleet size of each line  moreover  the convenience of considering the energy consumption as part of a broad objective function that includes other relevant costs is pointed out  otherwise  passengers and operators could face up to an increase in the whole cost and a decrease in the quality of service  a real data scenario  based on the c 2 line of the madrid metropolitan railways  is used to illustrate the proposed methodology and to discuss the differences between the energy efficient solutions and those obtained when considering operation and acquisition costs   c  2017 elsevier ltd  all rights reserved  
 designing a bicycle and pedestrian traffic monitoring program to estimate annual average daily traffic in a small rural college town cycling and walking are commonly recognized as energy efficient alternatives to motorized transport  research and practice lack a comprehensive set of methods to assess spatiotemporal patterns of traffic volumes across an entire transportation network  current non motorized traffic monitoring programs are primarily implemented in urban areas and for singular components of the network  e g   off street trails  specific corridors   our approach synthesizes ongoing efforts in non motorized traffic monitoring to estimate annual average daily traffic  aadt   across an entire network in blacksburg  va   a small  rural college town  we selected count sites across the network  stratified by street functional class  e g   major roads  local roads   centrality of the link relative to origins and destinations  and planned bicycle facilities  we collected 45 456 h of pedestrian and cyclist counts using three types of automated counters  pneumatic tube  n   12   passive infrared  n  10   and radio beam  n   3  at both reference locations  n   4  1 year  and short duration locations  n   97  1 week  during 2015  we found a strong correlation between manual validation counts and automated counts  we used day of year scaling factors to estimate aadt for bicycles and pedestrians and found that temporal and spatial patterns differed between modes  pedestrian volumes were higher and more variable than bicycle volumes  median  interquartile range  aadt for pedestrians  135  89 292   bicycles  23  11 43    both modes were positively correlated with street functional class  presence of facilities  and proximity to campus  our approach provides insight for planners or policy makers interested in comprehensive monitoring programs to track performance measures or for use in environmental and health impact studies   c  2017 elsevier ltd  all rights reserved  
 designing a reliable and dynamic multimodal transportation network for biofuel supply chains this paper presents a cost efficient and reliable supply chain network design model for biomass to be delivered to biofuel plants  biomass is bulky  so transportation modes such as rail and barge can be used to deliver this product  for this reason  this study focuses on multimodal supply chain designs for biofuel  biomass supply is highly seasonal  but the high production seasons for biomass in the southeast united states often coincide with or are followed by hurricanes  and drought seasons  both of which impact transportation  the dynamic multimodel transportation network design model this paper presents enables this supply chain to cope with biomass supply fluctuations and to hedge against natural disasters  the mixed integer nonlinear programming model proposed is an np hard problem  and we develop an accelerated benders decomposition algorithm and a hybrid rolling horizon algorithm to solve this problem  we tested the performance of the algorithm on a case study using data from the southeast united states  the numerical experiments show that this proposed algorithm can solve large scale problem instances to a near optimal solution in a reasonable time  numerical analyses indicate that  under normal conditions  the minimum cost model outperforms the reliable models  however  under disaster scenarios  the minimum cost model is 2 65  to 9 20  more expensive than the reliable and static model and 6 28  to 17 73  more expensive than the reliable and dynamic model  thus  the reliable and dynamic multimodal network design decisions can aid biofuel supply chain management decisions  especially when considering the potential impacts of natural disasters

 detecting dominance in stated choice data and accounting for dominance based scale differences in logit models stated choice surveys have been used for several decades to estimate preferences of agents using choice models  and are widely applied in the transportation domain  different types of experimental designs that underlie such surveys have been used in practice  in unlabelled experiments  where all alternatives are described by the same generic utility function  such designs may suffer from choice tasks containing a dominant alternative  also in labelled experiments with alternative specific attributes and constants such dominance may occur  but to a lesser extent  we show that dominant alternatives are problematic because they affect scale and may bias parameter estimates  we propose a new measure based on minimum regret to calculate dominance and automatically detect such choice tasks in an experimental design or existing dataset  this measure is then used to define a new experimental design type that removes dominance and ensures the making of trade offs between attributes  finally  we propose a new regret scaled multinomial logit model that takes the level of dominance within a choice task into account  results using simulated and empirical data show that the presence of dominant alternatives can bias model estimates  but by making scale a function of a smooth approximation of normalised minimum regret we can properly account for scale differences without the need to remove choice tasks with dominant alternatives from the dataset  crown copyright  c  2017 published by elsevier ltd  all rights reserved  
 detection of driver engagement in secondary tasks from observed naturalistic driving behavior distracted driving has long been acknowledged as one of the leading causes of death or injury in roadway crashes  the focus of past research has been mainly on the impact of different causes of distraction on driving behavior  however  only a few studies attempted to address how some driving behavior attributes could be linked to the cause of distraction  in essence  this study takes advantage of the rich shrp 2 naturalistic driving study  nds  database to develop a model for detecting the likelihood of a driver s involvement in secondary tasks from distinctive attributes of driving behavior  five performance attributes  namely speed  longitudinal acceleration  lateral acceleration  yaw rate  and throttle position were used to describe the driving behavior  a model was developed for each of three selected secondary tasks  calling  texting  and passenger interaction  the models were developed using a supervised feed forward artificial neural network  ann  architecture to account for the effect of inherent nonlinearity in the relationships between driving behavior and secondary tasks  the results show that the developed ann models were able to detect the drivers  involvement in calling  texting  and passenger interaction with an overall accuracy of 99 5   98 1   and 99 8   respectively  these results show that the selected driving performance attributes were effective in detecting the associated secondary tasks with driving behavior  the results are very promising and the developed models could potentially be applied in crash investigations to resolve legal disputes in traffic accidents  
 determinants of mobility resource ownership in switzerland  changes between 2000 and 2010 the future development in mobility resource ownership is of great interest as the individual mobility behavior has critical impacts on transport infrastructure  land use  energy consumption  and environmental issues  such as greenhouse gas emissions and local air pollutants  analysis and forecasts of mobility resource ownership as needed for example in transport modelling or forecast studies  however  usually employ data of the latest national travel surveys available  therefore  changes in mobility resource ownership over time are often ignored  estimating logit based decision models on the large scale swiss national travel survey data for 2000 and 2010  the study identifies determinants of mobility resource ownership for the main mobility resources  driving licenses  car availability  general abonnement travel tickets  and half fare travel tickets   identifying also significant changes over time  the predictor variables comprise socio economic and socio demographic variables  spatial structure features  and mobility resource specific characteristics  our results show that age  sex  income  the size of the community  and geographical region influence mobility resource ownership in both years  2000 and 2010  furthermore  car based and public transport based mobility resources are substitutes for each other  between 2000 and 2010 a behavioral change is observed for selected sub populations  in 2010 women and persons above 40 years old are more likely to own a driving license and have a car available than in 2000  in addition  the positive effect of income on driving license and car ownership becomes smaller over time  finally the previously neglected variables  such as household structure  employment status and level of education are found to be significant in the explanation of mobility resource ownership

 developing a disaggregate travel demand system of models using data mining techniques the travel demand modelling has experienced a paradigm shift from aggregate to disaggregate models  leading to an increase in computational time and simulation cost  meanwhile  transferability models have emerged to reduce the associated cost and computational burden  but haven t discounted the disaggregation level  this research proposes the proof of the concept of an innovative transferability modelling framework to estimate total number of trips and trip attributes in a tour of trips at a disaggregate level  in contrast to tour based or activity based models  the focus of transferability models is on replicating trip patterns rather than reflecting travellers  behaviour  similar to previous transferability models  classifying decision tree is utilized as one of the modelling techniques in this study  moreover  the merits of a modified version of decision tree and the random forest methods are examined  victorian integrated survey of travel and activity  vista  in 2007 and 2009 are utilized to calibrate and validate the proposed framework  respectively  according to the results  the random forest method shows highest individual level accuracy while matching the system level observed distributions  
 developing a simulation framework for safe and optimal trajectories considering drivers  driving style advanced driving assistance systems  adas  have huge potential for improving road safety and travel times  however  their take up in the market is very slow  and these systems should consider driver s preferences to increase adoption rates  the aim of this study is to develop a model providing drivers with the optimal trajectory considering the motorist s driving style in real time  travel duration and safety are the main parameters used to find the optimal trajectory  a simulation framework to determine the optimal trajectory was developed in which the ego car travels in a highway environment scenario  using an agent oriented approach  the performance of the algorithm was compared against optimal trajectories computed offline with the hybrid a  algorithm  the new framework provides trajectories close to the optimal trajectory and is computationally achievable  the agents were shown to follow safe and fast trajectories in three tests scenarios  emergency braking  overtaking and a complex situation with multiple vehicles around the ego vehicle  different driver profiles were then tested in the complex scenario  showing that the proposed approach can adapt to driver preferences and provide a solution close to the optimal solution given the defined safety constraints  
 developing and validating an abbreviated version of the microscale audit for pedestrian streetscapes  maps abbreviated  purpose  macroscale built environment factors  e g   street connectivity  are correlated with physical activity  less studied but more modifiable microscale elements  e g   sidewalks  may also influence physical activity  but shorter audit measures of microscale elements are needed to promote wider use  this study evaluated the relation of an abbreviated 54 item streetscape audit tool with multiple measures of physical activity in four age groups  methods  we developed a 54 item version from the original 120 item microscale audit of pedestrian streetscapes  maps   audits were conducted on 0 25 0 45 mile routes from participant residences toward the nearest nonresidential destination for children  n 758   adolescents  n 897   younger adults  n 1655   and older adults  n 367   active transport and leisure physical activity were measured with surveys  and objective physical activity was measured with accelerometers  items to retain from original maps were selected primarily by correlations with physical activity  mixed linear regression analyses were conducted for maps abbreviated summary scores  adjusting for demographics  participant clustering  and macroscale walkability  results  maps abbreviated and original maps total scores correlated r  94 the maps abbreviated tool was related similarly to physical activity outcomes as the original maps  destinations and land use  streetscape and walking path characteristics   and overall total scores were significantly related to active transport in all age groups  street crossing characteristics were related to active transport in children and older adults  aesthetics and social characteristics were related to leisure physical activity in children and younger adults  and cul de sacs were related with physical activity in youth  total scores were related to accelerometer measured physical activity in children and older adults  conclusion  maps abbreviated is a validated observational measure for use in research  the length and related cost of implementation has been cited as a barrier to use of microscale instruments  so availability of this shorter validated measure could lead to more widespread use of streetscape audits in health research  
 developing leading indicators from ohs management audit data  determining the measurement properties of audit data from the field introduction  ohs management audits are one means of obtaining data that may serve as leading indicators  the measurement properties of such data are therefore important  this study used data from workwell audit program in ontario  a canadian province  the audit instrument consisted of 122 items related to 17 ohs management elements  the study sought answers regarding  a  the ability of audit based scores to predict workers  compensation claims outcomes   b  structural characteristics of the data in relation to the organization of the audit instrument  and  c  internal consistency of items within audit elements  method  the sample consisted of audit and claims data from 1240 unique firms that had completed one or two ohs management audits during 2007 2010  predictors derived from the audit results were used in multivariable negative binomial regression modeling of workers  compensation claims outcomes  confirmatory factor analyses were used to examine the instrument s structural characteristics  kuder richardson coefficients of internal consistency were calculated for each audit element  results  the ability of audit scores to predict subsequent claims data could not be established  factor analysis supported the audit instrument s element based structure  kr 20 values were high     0 83   conclusions  the workwell audit data display structural validity and high internal consistency  but not  to date  construct validity  since the audit scores are generally not predictive of subsequent firm claim experience  audit scores should not be treated as leading indicators of workplace ohs performance without supporting empirical data  practical applications  analyses of the measurement properties of audit data can inform decisionmakers about the operation of an audit program  possible future directions in audit instrument development  and the appropriate use of audit data  in particular  decision makers should be cautious in their use of audit scores as leading indicators  in the absence of supporting empirical data   c  2017 national safety council and elsevier ltd  all rights reserved  
 development and validation of a questionnaire to assess pedestrian receptivity toward fully autonomous vehicles this study analyzes pedestrian receptivity toward fully autonomous vehicles  favs  by developing and validating a pedestrian receptivity questionnaire for favs  prqf   the questionnaire included sixteen survey items based on attitude  social norms  trust  compatibility  and system effectiveness  482 participants from the united states  273 males and 209 females  age range  18 71 years  responded to an online survey  a principal component analysis determined three subscales describing pedestrians  receptivity toward favs  safety  interaction  and compatibility  this factor structure was verified by a confirmatory factor analysis and reliability of each subscale was confirmed  0 7   cronbach s alpha   0 9   regression analyses investigated associations with scenario based responses to the three prqf subscale scores  pedestrians  intention to cross the road in front of favs was significantly predicted by both safety and interaction scores  but not by the compatibility score  accepting favs in the existing traffic system was predicted by all three subscale scores  demographic influence on the receptivity revealed that males and younger respondents were more receptive toward favs  similarly  those from urban areas and people with higher personal innovativeness showed higher receptivity  finally  a significant effect of pedestrian behavior  as measured by the pedestrian behavior questionnaire  on receptivity is explored  people who show positive behavior believed that the addition of favs will improve overall traffic safety  those who show higher violation  lapse and aggression scores  were found to feel more confident about crossing the road in front of a fav  this questionnaire can be a potential research tool for designing and improving favs for road users outside the vehicles   c  2017 elsevier ltd  all rights reserved

 development of a real time prediction model of driver behavior at intersections using kinematic time series data as connected autonomous vehicles  cavs  enter the fleet  there will be a long period when these vehicles will have to interact with human drivers  one of the challenges for cavs is that human drivers do not communicate their decisions well  fortunately  the kinematic behavior of a human driven vehicle may be a good predictor of driver intent within a short time frame  we analyzed the kinematic time series data  e g   speed  for a set of drivers making left turns at intersections to predict whether the driver would stop before executing the turn  we used principal components analysis  pca  to generate independent dimensions that explain the variation in vehicle speed before a turn  these dimensions remained relatively consistent throughout the maneuver  allowing us to compute independent scores on these dimensions for different time windows throughout the approach to the intersection  we then linked these pca scores to whether a driver would stop before executing a left turn using the random intercept bayesian additive regression trees  five more road and observable vehicle characteristics were included to enhance prediction  our model achieved an area under the receiver operating characteristic curve  auc  of 0 84 at 94 m away from the center of an intersection and steadily increased to 0 90 by 46 m away from the center of an intersection  
 development of joint models for channel  store  and travel mode choice  grocery shopping in london the nature of shopping activity is changing in response to innovation in retailing and the growth in online channels  there is a growing interest from transport researchers  policy makers  marketing and retail businesses in understanding the implications of this change  however  existing tools and techniques developed for analysing behaviour in traditional retail environments do not adequately represent emerging complexities resulting from digital innovation  in this paper  we advance existing destination and mode choice models by incorporating online channels in a unified framework  this is a critical extension to existing transport literature on destination choice which largely ignores online activity  specifically  we develop discrete choice models using elemental store  including both online and in store  alternatives for joint choice of channel  store  and travel mode  we demonstrate the use of a widely accepted consumer panel dataset with minor modifications  for the first time in transport research  together with api based data mining tools that offer great potential for enrichment  the analysis focuses on grocery shopping and uses consumer data collected from two selected boroughs in london  results from multinomial logit and nested logit estimations are reported  the extension presented here provides the tools to quantify the effects of increased online shopping on traditional store formats and travel patterns  our results showed virtual alternatives currently offer an attractive substitute among early adopters for large basket shopping mostly for high income groups  this might suggest a significant reduction in shopping trips to hypermarkets often associated with large basket shopping potentially leading to store closures  online deliveries mostly draw from driving trips and less so from walking and public transport trips  the present study also confirmed previous findings related to smaller stores and longer travel distances being associated with declining utilities  agglomeration and competition significantly influencing store choice   c  2017 the authors  published by elsevier ltd  
 development of regionalized spfs for two lane rural roads in pennsylvania the american association of state highway and transportation officials  highway safety manual  hsm  contains safety performance functions  spfs  to predict annual crash frequencies for several roadway types  when applying these spfs in a jurisdiction whose data were not used to develop the spf  a calibration factor can be applied to adjust the expected crash frequency estimate to statewide or local conditions  alternatively  the hsm suggests that transportation agencies may develop their own spfs in lieu of applying the calibration factor to the hsm spfs  however  the hsm does not provide guidance on the appropriate level of regionalization that should be adopted for either method  even though safety performance may vary considerably within a state  in light of this  the present study considers the development of local or regionalized spfs for two lane rural highways within the commonwealth of pennsylvania  three regionalization levels were considered  statewide  engineering district and individual counties  the expected crash frequency for each level of regionalization was compared to the reported crash frequency over an eight year analysis period  the results indicate that district level spfs with county level adjustment factors provide better predictive accuracy than the development of a statewide spf or application of the hsm calibrated spf  the findings suggest that there are significant differences in safety performance across engineering districts within pennsylvania  as such  other state transportation agencies developing spfs or using calibration factors may also consider how variations across jurisdictions will affect predicted crash frequencies  
 development of safety performance index for intercity buses  an exploratory factor analysis approach in recent years in malaysia  severe road crashes involving intercity buses have been increasing  with increased public concerns about intercity bus safety  effectively managing travel risk has become critical for both intercity bus operators and road safety policy makers  intercity bus drivers are generally at a higher risk for crashes due to long hours of driving and exposure to different road conditions  therefore  understanding and quantifying their risks and taking steps to manage them could improve intercity bus safety  the aim of this study is to establish a safety performance index for each risk domain to measure and compare intercity bus safety in terms of risk factors  the risk domains considered in this study were road environment conditions  bus driver driving behaviors and bus safety conditions  the weighted indicators were aggregated into the safety performance index for each risk domain was done using the exploratory factor analysis method  the paired sample t test was then applied to determine which safety performance indices were significantly different from each other  the results indicate that road environment conditions have contributed more to intercity bus safety risks on the east coast than on the west coast of peninsular malaysia  the evidence presented in this study shows that different intercity bus companies showed mixed safety performance in different risk domains  therefore  we suggest the development of targeted road safety programs for each intercity bus company to address intercity bus safety problems  
 development of thoracic injury risk functions for the thor atd the test device for human occupant restraint  thor  50th percentile male anthropomorphic test device  atd  aims to improve the ability to predict the risk of chest injury to restrained automobile occupants by measuring dynamic chest deflection at multiple locations  this research aimed to describe the methods for developing a thoracic injury risk function  irf  using the multi point chest deflection metrics from the 50th percentile male thor metric atd with the sd 3 shoulder and associating to post mortem human subjects  pmhs  outcomes that were matched on identical frontal and frontal oblique impact sled testing conditions  several deflection metrics were assessed as potential predictor variables for ais 3  injury risk  including a combined metric  called pc score  which was generated from a principal component analysis  a parametric survival analysis  specifically  accelerated failure time  aft  with weibull distribution  was assessed in the development of the irf  model fit was assessed using various modeling diagnostics  including the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve  auc   models based on resultant deflection consistently exhibited improved fit compared to models based on x axis deflection or chord deflection  risk functions for the thor pc score and c max   maximum resultant deflection  were qualitatively equivalent  producing aucs of 0 857 and 0 861  respectively  adjusting for the potential confounding effects of age  aft survival models with c max or pc score as the primary deflection metric resulted in the thor injury risk models with the best combination of biomechanical appropriateness  potential utility and model fit  and may be recommended as injury predictors  
 deviation flow refueling location problem with capacitated facilities  model and algorithm at the beginning of the period of transition from petroleum based fuels to alternative green fuels  determining the optimal location of alternative fuel stations  afss  would be an important task  this paper addresses this issue under two main assumptions  first  the capacity of afss is limited and each afs can only serve a number of vehicles up to its capacity  second  drivers may have to deviate from their pre determined shortest path to get refueling services  this problem is formulated as a mixed integer linear programming  milp  model and a heuristic algorithm is developed to solve it  the heuristic method involves solving small and easy to solve linear programing  lp  models  embedded within a greedy approach  and hence  it requires an lp software  although the proposed milp model requires that the set of deviation paths be pregenerated with respect to the maximum tolerated deviation distance  the heuristic uses only a restricted set of such paths  the performance of the proposed model and algorithm is evaluated on some randomly generated instances   c  2017 elsevier ltd  all rights reserved  
 differences in gap acceptance for approaching cars and motorcycles at junctions  what causes the size arrival effect  this study investigated whether the size arrival effect for approaching vehicles  whereby people judge that approaching motorcycles will arrive later than approaching cars  is more likely to be due to overestimating the distance available in front of motorcycles or underestimating the speed of approaching motorcycles relative to cars  approaching vehicles at junctions  cars and motorcycles  were shown in a series of video clips  speed and distance information was provided  and photographs  only distance information was provided   drivers  judgments about whether it was safe to pull out was investigated  the vehicle effect arose only in the video condition when vehicles were presented at a far distance  it was concluded that drivers  error in judgment is likely to be due either to the miss estimation of the speed of approaching motorcycles or drivers making judgments based on the rate of optical expansion  rather than direct misperceptions of distance   c  2017 elsevier ltd  all rights reserved  
 differences in the kinematics of booster seated pediatric occupants using two different car seats objective  the objective of this article is to compare the performance of forward facing child restraint systems  crs  mounted on 2 different seats methods  two different anthropomorphic test device  atd  sizes  p3 and p6   using the same child restraint system  a non isofix high back booster seat   were exposed to the ece r44 regulatory deceleration pulse in a deceleration sled  two different seats  seat a  seat b  were used  three repetitions per atd and mounting seat were done  resulting in a total of 12 sled crashes  dummy sensors measured the head tri axial acceleration and angular rate and the thorax tri axial acceleration  all acquired at 10 000hz  a high speed video camera recorded the impact at 1 000 frames per second  the 3d kinematics of the head and torso of the atds were captured using a high speed motion capture system  1 000 hz   a pair matched statistical analysis compared the outcomes of the tests using the 2 different seats results  statistically significant differences in the kinematic response of the atds associated with the type of seat were observed  the maximum 3ms peak of the resultant head acceleration was higher on seat a for the p3 dummy  54 5 1 9 g vs  44 2     0 5 g  p   012  and for the p6 dummy  56 0     0 8 g vs  51 7     1 2 g  p   015   the peak belt force was higher on seat a than on seat b for the p3 dummy  5 488 0     198 0n vs  4 160 6     63 6n  p   008  and for the p6 dummy  7 014 0     271 0n vs  5 719 3     37 4n  p   015   the trajectory of the atd head was different between the 2 seats in the sagittal  transverse  and frontal planes conclusion  the results suggest that the overall response of the booster seated occupant exposed to the same impact conditions was different depending on the seat used regardless of the size of the atd  the differences observed in the response of the occupants between the 2 seats can be attributed to the differences in cushion stiffness  seat pan geometry  and belt geometry  however  these results were obtained for 2 particular seat models and a specific crs and therefore cannot be directly extrapolated to the generality of vehicle seats and crs  
 different ways to get to the same workplace  how does workplace location relate to commuting by different income groups  we examine whether commonly observed differences in commute behavior among different income groups are associated with the location of their workplaces  using the chicago metropolitan area as a case study  we classify six types of workplace locations to reflect the degree of employment centralization versus decentralization and the degree of employment clustering versus dispersion  based on the 2008 chicago regional household travel inventory  we found that low income workers are more likely to work in centralized but dispersed workplaces  while high income workers are more likely to work in employment clusters  the unequal distribution of workers in different workplaces  combined with distinctive commuting patterns to certain workplaces  partly explains commonly observed commute differences  such as shorter distance commutes and more public transit use by lower income workers  regression analysis shows that the association between income and commute mode varies by workplace  and  more importantly  commute mode has a greater association with workplace locations than with income  the results suggest considering workplace locations in empirical research on commuting inequalities and when establishing transportation and housing policies  
 discontinuation of the automobility regime  an integrated approach to multi level governance the case study at hand investigates a largely neglected phenomenon  the discontinuation of incumbent socio technical regimes by means of deliberate governance  comparing actor constellations and policy measures in four different countries  the uk  germany  france and the netherlands  and on the eu level  we identify strategies and measures that have been applied to challenge the automobility regime  instead of creating a new analytical framework for studying the governance of discontinuation  we propose to use three existing concepts  namely the multi level perspective  mlp   multi level governance  mlg  as well as actor centred approaches  combining them into one integrated concept labelled  multi level governance of socio technical regimes   from this perspective  the european union is the most active actor in attempts to restrict automobility  especially exerting pressure at the landscape level  however  in spite of various challenges  the automobility regime still remains considerably stable   c  2017 elsevier ltd  all rights reserved  
 discrete choice models for gap acceptance at urban expressway merge sections considering safety  road geometry  and traffic conditions a number of discrete choice models  including a multinomial logit model  mnl   a nested logit model  nl   and a latent choice set model  lcs   are applied to the representation of gap acceptance by merging vehicles  mvs  on urban expressways and their results are compared  the results show that all models give consistent signs to the estimated parameters  it is evident that the lcs model is capable of representing gap acceptance and allows exploration of the latent choice made by mvs  comparison of the models shows that lcs is superior to the traditional mnl and nl models in terms of goodness of fit and provides a more realistic simulation of mv behavior  the effects of geometry and traffic conditions are fully considered in this study  and they are found to significantly influence the choices made by mvs  a longer acceleration lane may provide a relatively larger gap for mvs and  therefore  motivate them to accept the gap  with respect to traffic conditions  an mv tends to reject a gap under low   20 vehicles km lane  or high density    40 vehicles km lane  conditions  however  gap acceptance is more likely when the density is from 20 to 40 vehicles km lane  with regard to safety  the concept of time to collision  ttc is adopted to capture the reactions of mvs to mainline vehicles  mlvs   both leading and following ttcs  between the mvand the leading following mlv  respectively  are implemented in the models  analyses indicate that the ttc thresholds for an mv to reject or accept a gap are 5 and 6 s for the leading and the following ttc  respectively   c  2017 american society of civil engineers  
 discrete time day to day dynamic congestion pricing scheme considering multiple equilibria in this study  we focus on the discrete time day to day dynamic congestion pricing scheme which varies the toll on a day to day basis and aims to drive the traffic system to a given objective traffic equilibrium state  as is well known  due to the asymmetric nature of the travel cost functions  multiple equilibria exist  in this case  without external force  the traffic system cannot converge to the traffic equilibrium state as desired by traffic management through a day to day adjustment process if the initial traffic state does not fall into its attraction domain  bie and lo  2010   therefore  it is imperative for traffic management to propose a traffic control measure to ensure the desired traffic state can be achieved regardless of the initial traffic state  previous studies on the day to day dynamic congestion pricing  either worked on continues time day to day pricing scheme  or took the form of discrete time day to day pricing scheme but did not guarantee the convergence to the desired objective traffic state for the cases when multiple traffic equilibria exist  both are undesirable  this study aims to develop a discrete time day to day pricing scheme so as to direct the traffic evolution to reach the desired equilibrium from any initial traffic state when multiple traffic equilibria exist  based on the very general formulation of day today traffic dynamics model  we present a general formulation of such day to day pricing schemes and propose a method to obtain one specific road pricing scheme  moreover  we present rigorous proofs and numerical tests to verify the proposed pricing scheme   c  2017 elsevier ltd  all rights reserved  
 dispatching policies for last mile distribution with stochastic supply and demand relief distribution has received considerable attention in the disaster operations management literature  however  the majority of this literature assumes that supply is always available  in reality  a significant portion of the materials that flow through the humanitarian relief chain are donations  which represent an uncertain supply source in terms of both quantity and timing  this paper investigates a two stage relief chain consisting of a single staging area  sa  where donations arrive over time in uncertain quantities  which are periodically distributed to random numbers of disaster survivors located at a point of distribution  pod   a single vehicle travels back and forth between the sa and pod transporting relief supplies during a finite horizon  the goal of this study is to identify dispatching policies for the vehicle with the sole purpose of minimizing unsatisfied demand at the pod  to this end  we examine the effectiveness of two common sense heuristic policies relative to the optimal dispatching policy  the latter of which is determined via stochastic dynamic programming  our findings indicate that although continuously dispatching the vehicle between the sa and pod is not an optimal policy  it is either optimal or close to optimal in most situations   c  2017 elsevier ltd  all rights reserved  
 distracting behaviors among teenagers and young  middle aged  and older adult drivers when driving without and with warnings from an integrated vehicle safety system introduction  negative reinforcement from crash warnings may reduce the likelihood that drivers engage in distracted driving  alternatively  drivers may compensate for the perceived safety benefit of crash warnings by engaging in distractions more frequently  especially at higher speeds  the purpose of this study was to examine whether warning feedback from an integrated vehicle based safety system affected the likelihood that various secondary behaviors were present among drivers ages 16 17  20 30  40 50  and 60 70  method  participants drove an instrumented sedan with various collision warning systems for an extended period  ten 5 second video clips were randomly sampled from driving periods at speeds above 25 mph and below 5 mph each week for each driver and coded for the presence of 11 secondary behaviors  results  at least one secondary behavior was present in 46  of video clips  conversing with a passenger  17    personal grooming  9    and cellphone conversation  6   were the most common  the likelihood that at least one secondary behavior was present was not significantly different during periods when drivers received warnings relative to periods without warnings  at least one secondary behavior was 21  more likely to be present at speeds below 5 mph relative to speeds above 25 mph  however  the effect of vehicle speed was not significantly affected by warning presence  separate models for each of the five most common secondary behaviors also indicated that warnings had no significant effect on the likelihood that each behavior was present  conclusions  collision warnings were not associated with significant increases or decreases in the overall likelihood that teen and adult drivers engaged in secondary behaviors or the likelihood of the behaviors at speeds above 25 mph or below 5 mph  practical applications  there was no evidence that forward collision warning and other technologies like those in this study will increase or decrease distracted driving   c  2017 national safety council and elsevier ltd  all rights reserved  
 distraction or cognitive overload  using modulations of the autonomic nervous system to discriminate the possible negative effects of advanced assistance system the interaction with advanced driver assistance systems has several positive implications for road safety  but also some potential downsides such as mental workload and automation complacency  malleable attentional resources allocation theory describes two possible processes that can generate workload in interaction with advanced assisting devices  the purpose of the present study is to determine if specific analysis of the different modalities of autonomic control of nervous system can be used to discriminate different potential workload processes generated during assisted driving tasks and automation complacency situations  thirty five drivers were tested in a virtual scenario while using head up advanced warning assistance system  repeated manova were used to examine changes in autonomic activity across a combination of different user interactions generated by the advanced assistance system   1  expected take over request without anticipatory warning   2  expected take over request with two second anticipatory warning   3  unexpected take over request with misleading warning   4  unexpected take over request without warning  results shows that analysis of autonomic modulations can discriminate two different resources allocation processes  related to different behavioral performances  the user s interaction that required divided attention under expected situations produced performance enhancement and reciprocally coupled parasympathetic inhibition with sympathetic activity  at the same time  supervising interactions that generated automation complacency were described specifically by uncoupled sympathetic activation  safety implications for automated assistance systems developments are considered

 do attitudes cause behavior or vice versa  an alternative conceptualization of the attitude behavior relationship in travel behavior modeling attitudes are thought to play an important role in determining people s travel behavior  although researchers have acknowledged the possibility of a reverse relationship  given the importance of knowledge about the direction of causation as a basis for policies and programs designed to effect behavioral change  the scarcity of in depth research on this subject is surprising and problematic  the aim of the present paper is twofold  first to assess the bidirectional relationships between attitudes and behavior  in a transport context  and second to present a new framework to study attitude behavior  in consistency over time  to achieve these aims  we use data from a two wave mobility panel to estimate cross lagged panel models and latent transition models  results indicate that use of a mode and the attitude towards using that mode mutually influence each other over time  as expected  we find that people who have dissonant  i e   non aligned  attitude behavior patterns are less stable than those who have consonant patterns  contrary to conventional wisdom and commonly used model structures  however  the effects of behaviors on attitudes are much larger than vice versa  that is  dissonant travelers are more inclined to adjust their attitudes to align those with their behavior than vice versa  based on these results  we outline several implications for research and policy   c  2017 elsevier ltd  all rights reserved  
 do cyclists make better drivers  associations between cycling experience and change detection in road scenes efficient processing of visual information is crucial to safe driving  previous research has demonstrated that driving experience strongly affects attentional allocation  with large differences between novice and experienced drivers  expanding on this  we explored the influence of non driving experiences on attentional allocation by comparing drivers with and without cycling experience  based on situation awareness field studies  we predicted cyclist drivers would demonstrate superior performance  participants were 42 experienced drivers  17 female  25 male  aged 30 50 years  m   39 8   20 drivers and 22 cyclist drivers  the experiment used a change detection flicker task  in which participants must determine whether two alternating images are identical  change absent  or differ in a single detail  change present   the changed object was either a road sign  car  pedestrian  or bicycle  change target significantly affected both accuracy and response time  all participants were slower and less accurate at detecting changes to road signs  compared with when the change was a moving road user  i e   car  pedestrian  bicycle   accuracy did not differ significantly between groups  but cyclist drivers were significantly faster than drivers at identifying changes  with the effect being largest for bicycle and sign changes  the results suggest that cycling experience is associated with more efficient attentional processing for road scenes  
 do fixed links affect settlement patterns  a synthetic control approach this paper evaluates the extent to which transportation projects affect settlement patterns  we consider fixed link projects because they provide a large and swift change in accessibility  we use the synthetic control method and estimate the impacts on settlement patterns for 11 fixed links projects constructed in the period from 1989 to 2008  the synthetic controls are weighted averages of control municipalities with weights chosen to replicate population trends in the pre fixed link periods  we find clear impacts on settlement patterns for fixed links connecting islands to urban areas and on islands utilizing natural resources  although there are exceptions  in the other cases  the impacts are negligible   c  2017 elsevier ltd  all rights reserved  
 do management practices support or constrain safe driving behaviour  a multi level investigation in a sample of occupational drivers it has been estimated that one third of all work related deaths occur while driving for work related purposes  despite this  many organisations are unaware of the practices  beyond those that identify and control the impact of unforeseen events  i e   risk management   that predispose drivers to risk  this study addresses the issue by identifying the management practices operationalised as  high performance workplace systems  hpws  that influence safe driver behaviour  the study also explores the value given to safety by senior level management as a moderator of the relationship between hpws practices and driver behaviour  each factor was tested within a two level hierarchical model consisting of 911 drivers  nested within 161 supervisors and 83 organisations  the findings highight that under conditions of high investment in job and work design  communication and selection practices  drivers reported poorer driving behaviour  an interaction effect also demonstrated that under conditions of high investment in remuneration  drivers reported safer behaviour  but only when they perceived that managers valued and prioritised safety  the findings challenge current thinking in the management of workplace road safety   c  2017 elsevier ltd  all rights reserved  
 do safety performance functions used for predicting crash frequency vary across space  applying geographically weighted regressions to account for spatial heterogeneity safety performance functions  spfs  provide a basis for identifying locations where countermeasures can be effective  while spfs in the highway safety manual  hsm  were calibrated based on data from select states  calibration factors can be developed to localize spfs to other states  calibration factors typically provide a coarse adjustment time and space stationarity of associations between crash frequencies and various factors is still assumed  implying that the spf functional form is transferable  however  with increasing availability of state wide geo referenced safety data  new spatial analysis methods  and increasing computational power  it is possible to relax the stationarity assumption  specifically  to address spatial heterogeneity in spfs  this study proposes relaxing spfs  referring to them as localized spfs  l spfs   that can be developed by using sophisticated geo spatial modeling techniques that allow correlates of crash frequencies to vary in space  for demonstration  a 2013 geo referenced freeway crash and traffic database from virginia is used  as a potential methodological alternative  crash frequencies are predicted by estimating geographically weighted negative binomial regressions  this model significantly outperforms the traditional negative binomial model in terms of model goodness of fit  providing a better and fuller understanding of spatial variations in modeled relationships  our study results uncover significant spatial variations in parameter estimates for annual average daily traffic  aadt  and segment length  ignoring such variations can result in prediction errors  the results indicate low transferability of a single statewide spf highlighting the importance of developing l spfs  from a practical standpoint  l spfs can better predict crash frequencies and support prioritizing safety improvements in specific locations  
 do we see how they perceive risk  an integrated analysis of risk perception and its effect on workplace safety behavior while risk perception is a key factor influencing safety behavior  the academia lacks specific attention to the ways that workers perceive risk  and thus little is known about the mechanisms through which different risk perceptions influence safety behavior  most previous research in the workplace safety domain argues that people tend to perceive risk based on rational formulations of risk criticality  however  individuals  emotions can be also useful in understanding their perceptions  therefore  this research employs an integrated analysis concerning the rational and emotional perspectives  specifically  it was expected that the identified three rational ways of perceiving risk  i e   perceived probability  severity  and negative utility  would influence the direct emotional risk perception  furthermore  these four risk perceptions were all expected to positively but differently influence safety behavior  the hypotheses were tested using a sample of 120 construction workers  it was found that all the three rational risk perceptions significantly influenced workers  direct perception of risk that is mainly based on emotions  furthermore  safety behavior among workers relied mainly on emotional perception but not rational calculations of risk  this research contributes to workplace safety research by highlighting the importance of integrating the emotional assessment of risk  especially when workers  risk perception and behavior are concerned  suggested avenues for improving safety behavior through improvement in risk perception include being aware of the possibility of different ways of perceiving risk  promoting experience sharing and accident simulation  and uncovering risk information  
 does air pollution drive away tourists  a case study of the sun moon lake national scenic area  taiwan tourism is evidently one of critical contributors to air pollution  while  air pollution seems to drive tourists away  this paper aims to explore whether air pollution  especially the carbon dioxide emission  would affect the business cycle of the demand for tourism at a popular scenic spot in taiwan  i e   the sun moon lake  macroeconomic variables and additional weather patterns are also considered as potential determinants of the demand for tourism in our markov regime switching model  the empirical results serve as evidence that the effects of air pollution and rainfall on the demand for tourism depend significantly on the phases of business cycle  and show that  during the peaks  monthly numbers of tourists traveling at the sun moon lake would fall by 25 725 people as the number of bad air quality day increases by one  the finding can provide policymakers an insight into the evaluation of the trade off between industrial development and environmental protection   c  2017 elsevier ltd  all rights reserved

 does competition in the housing market cause transport poverty  interrelations of residential location choice and mobility introduction this contribution examines the impact of the housing market on daily mobility and is based on the assumption that  in a supply dominated housing market  as availability and affordability decline  many people must compromise  particularly on accessibility related decision criteria when searching for a residential location  this applies even more to households with low financial flexibility  which can neither bear the high cost of housing in accessible inner city neighborhoods nor afford the higher cost of mobility in less well connected suburban areas  methods these interrelations are examined in a current study in more detail by means of problem centered qualitative interviews highlighting the situation of low income households  using the munich metropolitan region as an example  this paper gives an overview of interrelations and presents selected results of the study  results low income households do not change their residential location unless it is really necessary  if they do move  they are nearly unable to optimize their location in order to have better access to destinations  whereas they are able to change some destinations  there are also some immutable destinations  which lead to an increase in effort spent on transport  conclusions all in all the insights presented confirm the suggested assumptions  they show the very limited residential choices low income households have  but leave room for further evaluations on possible implications  
 does competition matter in measures of job accessibility  explaining employment in los angeles planning organizations are increasingly looking to accessibility measures to understand how well the transportation system provides access to employment opportunities  however  the most common type of job accessibility measure employed in planning practice  the cumulative opportunity measure  considers job supply but overlooks competition for jobs  therefore  the cumulative opportunity measure may not fully capture workers  access to job opportunity  in this paper  we examine four accessibility measures  two of which account for spatial competition and the other two do not  using the los angeles metropolitan area as a case study  we find that measures of competitive accessibility have stronger associations with employment than non competitive accessibility measures  we examine the relationship between residential accessibility and employment for four separate levels of educational attainment  and we find that competitive measures are especially pertinent for population segments with lower educational attainment  therefore  we recommend competitive accessibility measures to assess the employment opportunity more accurately  
 does exposure to new transport infrastructure result in modal shifts  patterns of change in commute mode choices in a four year quasi experimental cohort study background  intervention studies suggest that changing the built environment may encourage a modal shift from car travel towards active travel  however  little is known about the detail of patterns of changes in travel behaviour  method  adult commuters working in cambridge  uk  completed annual questionnaires between 2009 and 2012  commuting was assessed using a validated seven day travel to work record  the intervention consisted of the opening of a guided busway with a path for walking and cycling in 2011  exposure to the intervention was defined as the negative of the square root of the shortest road distance from home to the busway  we investigated the association between exposure to the intervention and specific modal shifts and patterns of change  along with individual mode choice patterns over the entire four year period  results  five groups of patterns of change were found in our in depth explorations   1  no change   2  a full modal shift   3  a partial modal shift   4  non stable but patterned behaviour  and  5  complicated or apparently random patterns  a minority of participants had a directed change of either a full modal shift or  more commonly  a partial modal shift  whereas a large proportion showed a highly variable pattern  no significant associations were found between exposure to the intervention and specific modal shifts or patterns of change  conclusion  our analyses revealed a large diversity in  changes in  travel behaviour patterns over time  and showed that the intervention did not result in one specific pattern of behaviour change or produce only full modal shifts  these insights are important for improving the measurement of travel behaviour  improving our understanding of how changes in travel behaviour patterns occur  and fully capturing the potential impacts of interventions  
 does gender moderate the association between intellectual ability and accidental injuries  evidence from the 1953 stockholm birth cohort study in this paper  we test for gender differences in the effects of intellectual ability on accidental injury risks using longitudinal data from the 1953 stockholm birth cohort study  n   14 294   intellectual ability was measured using iq tests issued during a school survey at age similar to 13  and outcome and covariate data was collected via record linkage to population and health registers  following the cohort from childhood to 55 years of age  we used icd codes to identify accidental injuries resulting in hospital admissions and deaths  and shared frailty models to quantify the effects of iq  while allowing for within individual dependencies and recurrent events  the models included tests for the moderating effects of gender  as well as childhood family variables  parental socioeconomic status   and cohort member mediators  highest achieved education  socioeconomic status and income at the time of the event   the results indicate an inverse association between childhood iq and subsequent accidental injury events  where 1 sd decrease in iq implies a 17 8  increase in injury risk  we also found evidence that gender moderates this relationship  where the effect size was twice as large for men than for women  21 8  vs 9 3  per 1 sd decrease   adult socioeconomic status can explain roughly half of the observed association  potential explanations for these results are discussed  
 does getting away with it count  an application of stafford and warr s reconceptualised model of deterrence to drink driving drink drivers continue to be disproportionately represented in road mortalities and morbidities  given these costs  countermeasures that effectively reduce the behaviour  and its consequences  are imperative  research has produced inconsistent findings regarding the deterrent effects of some countermeasures on drink driving behaviour  namely legal sanctions  suggesting other factors may be more influential  this study aimed to determine which deterrence measures based on classical deterrence theory and stafford and warr s  1993  re conceptualised model of deterrence influence the propensity to drink and drive over the legal blood alcohol content limit of 0 05  in total  1257 australian drivers aged from 16 to 85 years completed a questionnaire assessing their self reported drink driving behaviour and perceptions of legal sanctions  consistent with previous research  past experiences of direct punishment avoidance was the most significant predictor of drink driving  additionally  perceptions of personal certainty of apprehension were a significant  albeit weak  negative predictor of drink driving  counterintuitively  experiences of indirect punishment were predictive of self reported drink driving  similarly  penalty severity produced mixed results as those who considered a penalty would be severe were less likely to drink and drive  however those that considered the penalty would cause a considerable impact on their lives  were more likely to drink and drive  taken together  these findings suggest that while the threat of apprehension and punishment may influence self reported drink driving behaviours  committing and offence while avoiding detection is a significant influence upon ongoing offending  this paper will further elaborate on the findings in regards to developing salient and effective deterrents that produce a lasting effect  
 does perceived stress mediate the relationship between commuting and health related quality of life  previous research indicates that employees with long commutes suffer from impaired health  in this paper  we argue that this relation should be conceptualized within a stress strain framework  using data from 1928 expatriate employees of the german foreign office  we test the mediating role of perceived stress in the relation between daily commuting time and health related quality of life  hrqol   we find that long commutes are associated with substantially lower hrqol and that this relation is well accounted for by associated increases in stress  particularly among parents  we discuss how a stress perspective can inform future research on commuting impacts and implications for individual  organizational  and policy interventions to mitigate adverse consequences of commuting   c  2017 elsevier ltd  all rights reserved  
 does public transit improvement affect commuting behavior in beijing  china  a spatial multilevel approach developing countries like china have experienced substantial city transformations over the past decade  city transformations are characterized by transportation innovations that allow individuals to access to speedy commuting modes for work activities and offer potential influences on commuting behavior  this paper examines the potential effects of subway system expansion in beijing on commuting behavior  our methodological design controls for spatial effects by employing bayesian multilevel binary logistic models with spatial random effects  using cross sectional individual surveys in beijing  the results suggest that there is a significant rise in subway commuting trips while non motorized and bus commuting trips are reduced with the new subway expansion  model comparison results show evidence about the presence of spatial effects in influencing the role of built environment characteristics to play in the commuting behavior analysis   c  2016 elsevier ltd  all rights reserved  
 does subway proximity discourage automobility  evidence from beijing many cities around the world are investing in rail transit  but whether it can effectively reduce road congestion and air pollution from automobiles remains an open question  a major challenge to empirically answering this question is the fact that the choices of residential location and travel mode are jointly made by households  the unique context of urban housing in beijing provides us a natural experiment to separate residential location and travel choices of households living in the resettlement and reformed housing units  we take advantage of the largely exogenous residential locations of those living in the resettlement and reformed housing in beijing and use the heckman two step method to correct a potential bias in estimating vehicle fuel consumption  to identify the heterogeneous effects of different subway stations  we use the travel time to city center by subway to proxy a subway station s value to users  we find robust evidence supporting that subway proximity reduces a household s probability of owning a car and subsequent fuel consumption  more valuable subway stations discourage nearby households  car ownership rate by a greater extent  evidence does suggest the existence of residential self selection   c  2016 elsevier ltd  all rights reserved  
 does the social context help with understanding and predicting the choice of activity type and duration  an application of the multiple discrete continuous nested extreme value model to activity diary data an understanding of activity choices and duration is a key requirement for better policy making  in transport and beyond  previous studies have failed to make the important link with individuals  social context  in this paper  the multiple discrete continuous nested extreme value  mdcnev  model is applied to the choice of activity type and duration over the course of two days  using data from the chilean city of concepcion  in common with other studies  heterogeneity across decision makers is accommodated in the model by analysing the impact of different socio demographic  mobility and residential location variables on both the activity choice and the time allocation decision  in addition  different social network and social capital measures are found to be significantly correlated with the choice and duration of different activities  and we show how these relationships seem to differ from the effects of socio demographic variables  finally  we perform a forecasting exercise using the mdcnev model  highlighting the differences in substitution patterns from a standard mdcev model   c  2017 elsevier ltd  all rights reserved  
 doubly dynamics for multi modal networks with park and ride and adaptive pricing this paper models and controls a multi region and multi modal transportation system  given that the travelers can adjust their mode choices from day to day  and the within day traffic dynamics in the network also evolve over days  in particular  it considers that the city network can be partitioned into two regions  center and periphery   there are park and ride facilities located at the boundary between the city center region and the periphery  travelers can either drive to the city center  or take public transit  or drive to the park and ride facilities and then transfer to the public transit  travelers can  learn  from their travel experience  as well as real time information about traffic conditions  thus will adjust their choices accordingly  it follows that the dynamic traffic pattern  within day  in the city network will evolve over  calendar  time  day to day   to improve traffic efficiency in the network  an adaptive mechanism  which does not need detailed travelers  behavioral characteristics  is developed to update parking pricing  or congestion pricing  from period to period  e g   one period can be one month   the developed doubly dynamics methodological framework coupled with a feedback pricing mechanism unfolds and influences equilibrium system characteristics that traditional static day to day models cannot observe  the proposed adaptive pricing approach is practical for implementation in large scale networks as the variables involved can be observed in real life with monitoring techniques  also  it can contribute to reduce total social cost effectively  as shown in the numerical experiments   c  2017 elsevier ltd  all rights reserved  
 downtown parking supply  work trip mode choice and urban spatial structure this paper examines the effects of changes in downtown parking supply on urban welfare  modal choice decisions and urban spatial structure using a spatial general equilibrium model of a closed monocentric city with two transport modes  endogenous residential parking and a form of bottleneck congestion at the cbd  our analysis shows that parking reforms at the cbd that increase delay congestion costs in the short run such as parking supply limits can be welfare improving if other commuting externalities such as air pollution can be reduced  in addition  because parking limits can also change location decisions such as where to live and invest they may complement anti sprawl policies efforts by leading to a more compact urban spatial structure in the long run  we also show that changes in downtown parking supply can have different spatial impacts on the market supply of residential parking by affecting urban residents  location decisions  finally  we investigate whether the self financing theorem of transportation economics holds within the context of our spatial urban model   c  2017 elsevier ltd  all rights reserved  
 drinking and driving behavior at stop signs and red lights alcohol is one of the principal risk factors for motor vehicle crashes  one factor that contributes to vehicle crashes is noncompliance with stop signs and red lights  the present experiment investigated the effects of alcohol and drinking patterns on driving behavior at stop signs and red lights  28 participants participated in drinking and simulated driving sessions during which they received a moderate dose of alcohol  0 08  bac  or a placebo  simulated driving tasks measured participants  driving performance at stop signs and red lights in response to each dose  results suggested that alcohol impaired the driver control of speed and direction and prolonged their simple and complex reaction time  which were exhibited by impaired speed and lateral control  longer reaction time when the lights turned yellow  and lower deceleration towards stop signs and red lights  visual degradation may also occur under alcohol intake  it was also suggested that alcohol impaired non binge drinkers more severely  to be specific  higher acceleration was observed in impaired non binge drinkers  
 driver and front passenger injury in frontal crashes  update on the effect of unbelted rear occupants purpose  this is a study of the influence of an unbelted rear occupant on the risk of severe injury to the front seat occupant ahead of them in frontal crashes  it provides an update to earlier studies methods  1997 2015 nass cds data were used to investigate the risk for severe injury  maximum abbreviated injury score  mais  4 f  to belted drivers and front passengers in frontal crashes by the presence of a belted or unbelted passenger seated directly behind them or without a rear passenger  frontal crashes were identified with gad1   f without rollover  rollover 0   front and rear outboard occupants were included without ejection  ejection   0   injury severity was defined by mais and fatality  f  by treatmnt   1 or injsev   4  weighted data were determined  the risk for mais 4 f was determined using the number of occupants with known injury status mais 0 f  standard errors were determined results  the risk for severe injury was 0 803 0 263  for the driver with an unbelted left rear occupant and 0 100     0 039  with a belted left rear occupant  the driver s risk was thus 8 01times greater with an unbelted rear occupant than with a belted occupant  p   001   with an unbelted right rear occupant behind the front passenger  the risk for severe injury was 0 277     0 091  for the front passenger  the corresponding risk was 0 165     0 075  when the right rear occupant was belted  the front passenger s risk was 1 68times greater with an unbelted rear occupant behind them than a belted occupant  p   001   the driver s risk for mais 4 f was highest when their seat was deformed forward  the risk was 9 94times greater with an unbelted rear occupant than with a belted rear occupant when the driver s seat deformed forward  it was 13 4     12 2  with an unbelted occupant behind them and 1 35     0 95  with a belted occupant behind them conclusions  consistent with prior literature  seat belt use by a rear occupant significantly lowered the risk for severe injury to belted occupants seated in front of them  the reduction was greater for drivers than for front passengers  it was 87 5  for the driver and 40 6  for the front passenger  these results emphasize the need for belt reminders in all seating positions  
 driver braking behavior analysis to improve autonomous emergency braking systems in typical chinese vehicle bicycle conflicts bicycling is one of the fundamental modes of transportation especially in developing countries  because of the lack of effective protection for bicyclists  vehicle bicycle  v b  accident has become a primary contributor to traffic fatalities  although aeb  autonomous emergency braking  systems have been developed to avoid or mitigate collisions  they need to be further adapted in various conflict situations  this paper analyzes the driver s braking behavior in typical v b conflicts of china to improve the performance of bicyclist aeb systems  naturalistic driving data were collected  from which the top three scenarios of v b accidents in china were extracted  including scr  a bicycle crossing the road from right while a car is driving straight   scl  a bicycle crossing the road from left while a car is driving straight  and ssr  a bicycle swerving in front of the car from right while a car is driving straight   for safety and data reliability  a driving simulator was employed to reconstruct these three scenarios and some 25 licensed drivers were recruited for braking behavior analysis  results revealed that driver s braking behavior was significantly influenced by v b conflict types  pre decelerating behaviors were found in scl and ssr conflicts  whereas in scr the subjects were less vigilant  the brake reaction time and brake severity in lateral v b conflicts  scr and scl  was shorter and higher than that in longitudinal conflicts  ssr   the findings improve their applications in the bicyclist aeb and test protocol enactment to enhance the performance of bicyclist aeb systems in mixed traffic situations especially for developing countries  
 driver compliance to take over requests with different auditory outputs in conditional automation conditionally automated driving  cad  systems are expected to improve traffic safety  whenever the cad system exceeds its limit of operation  designers of the system need to ensure a safe and timely enough transition from automated to manual mode  an existing visual human machine interface  hmi  was supplemented by different auditory outputs  the present work compares the effects of different auditory outputs in form of  1  a generic warning tone and  2  additional semantic speech output on driver behavior for the announcement of an upcoming take over request  tor   we expect the information carried by means of speech output to lead to faster reactions and better subjective evaluations by the drivers compared to generic auditory output  to test this assumption  n   17 drivers completed two simulator drives  once with a generic warning tone   generic   and once with additional speech output   speech   generic    while they were working on a non driving related task  ndrt  i e   reading a magazine   each drive incorporated one transition from automated to manual mode when yellow secondary lanes emerged  different reaction time measures  relevant for the take over process  were assessed  furthermore  drivers evaluated the complete hmi regarding usefulness  ease of use and perceived visual workload just after experiencing the take over  they gave comparative ratings on usability and acceptance at the end of the experiment  results revealed that reaction times  reflecting information processing time  i e   hands on the steering wheel  termination of ndrt   were shorter for  speech   generic  compared to  generic  while reaction time  reflecting allocation of attention  i e   first glance ahead   did not show this difference  subjective ratings were in favor of the system with additional speech output

 drivers of changes in spanish accessibility for the 1960 2010 period purpose the accessibility of a certain place can evolve either as the direct result of transport changes or as a consequence of the spatial redistribution of economic activities  these two factors are often indistinguishable especially at regional level since improved infrastructure stimulates relocation of activities  moreover  infrastructure investment choices tend to follow population and economic activity patterns  distorting the cause and effect relationship between infrastructure and accessibility even further  the methodology and results presented here decompose the impact of both factors in terms of accessibility using spanish data between 1960 and 2010  during this period  spain experienced profound changes in transport infrastructure and economic activity  methods we use the potential accessibility indicator and resort to index number theory to disentangle the contribution of transport infrastructure from that of land use changes  detailed historical data on road infrastructure and population is used to represent the transport and land use components of accessibility  results our results show that changes in transport infrastructure had a relevant impact on accessibility  as expected  but changes in the spatial distribution of population had an even greater effect  this outcome may be used as an argument for sustainable accessibility  a concept that advocates integration of transport and land use planning  
 drivers  self perceptions about being an eco driver according to their concern for the environment  beliefs on eco driving  and driving behavior technological progress has allowed motorized transportation to make a step toward more sustainable mobility but remains one of the main causes of air pollution in france  one way to help reduce the detrimental impact of motorized road transportation is to lead drivers  particularly car dependent ones  to adopt eco driving  however numerous drivers do not abide by highway laws or display driving anger behaviors  which are in opposition to eco driving  unfortunately  few people practice eco driving and many new adopters often have trouble maintaining this driving style  what is more  most studies on this issue have focused on eco driving gains  the ability of people to put it into effect  and or the continuous decline in the number of people who practice eco driving  they usually do not take into account people s self perceptions about their driving style  nor the associated beliefs  the aim of the present self report study was twofold  identify drivers  self perceptions about being an eco driver  and determine how these self perceptions about being an eco driver or not are linked to eco driving friendly behaviors  levers favoring eco driving  concern for the environment   and brakes on eco driving  driving anger and road violations   according to gender  an online survey was carried out with 300 french drivers  127 men  ages 19 83  in our sample  11 3  of the drivers said they felt they were eco drivers  g1   50  said they feel trying to eco drive  g2   9 7  said they had never heard of eco driving and 25  said they knew about eco driving but didn t do it  g3  felt they were not eco driver   and 4  said they felt they had abandoned eco driving  g4   the differences between the first three groups  g1 vs  g2 g3  were in line with their eco driving self perceptions  g1 had higher scores on three eco driving friendly behavior scale components and on environmental conservation  and lower scores on one factor of the driving anger scale  also in line with the groups  eco driving self perceptions  g2 s scores were higher than g3 s scores on one eco driving friendly behavior component  a gender by group interaction was found for g1 vs  g3 on one eco driving friendly behavior component  with a larger increase in the men s than the women s scores on eco driving self perceptions  finally  violation scores  once again  were higher for men than for women on the speed and anger subscales  the findings of this study are discussed with respect to improving eco driving learning  
 drivers  social work relationships as antecedents of unsafe driving  a social network perspective in order to reduce road accidents rates  studies around the globe have attempted to shed light on the antecedents for unsafe road behaviors  the aim of the current research is to contribute to this literature by offering a new organizational antecedent of driver s unsafe behavior  the driver s relationships with his or her peers  as reflected in three types of social networks  negative relationships network  friendship networks and advice networks  safety consulting   we hypothesized that a driver s position in negative relationship networks  friendship networks  and advice networks will predict unsafe driving  additionally  we hypothesized the existence of mutual influences among the driver s positions in these various networks  and suggested that the driver s positions interact to predict unsafe driving behaviors  the research included 83 professional drivers from four different organizations  driving behavior data were gathered via the ivdr  in vehicle data recorder  system  installed in every truck to measure and record the driver s behavior  the findings indicated that the drivers  position in the team networks predicts safe driving behavior  centrality in negative relationship networks is positively related to unsafe driving  and centrality in friendship networks is negatively related to unsafe driving  while centrality in advice networks is not related to unsafe driving  furthermore  we found an interaction effect between negative network centrality and centrality in friendship networks  the relation between negative networks and unsafe behavior is weaker when high levels of friendship network centrality exist  the implications will be presented in the discussion section  
 drivers  speed behaviour in real and simulated urban roads   a validation study traffic accidents and injuries constitute a growing problem for europe s urban transportation system  driving simulators can be active support tools in the design process of urban driving environments  provided that they are appropriately validated  the aim of this study was to establish the behavioural validity  in relative and absolute terms  of the motion base driving simulator of the road safety and accident reconstruction laboratory  lasis  of the university of florence in order to use it to evaluate the effectiveness of the urban road safety treatment design process  the research was conducted by comparing the driving speed collected in field with those recorded in the 3d virtual reality experiments through conventional and integrative statistical methods  speeds were recorded at twenty one measurement sites located in homogeneous road sections characterized by a less or more demanding driving environment  thirty four participants drove the virtual scenario which reproduced the real situation  the results of the comparative and conventional statistical analysis established the relative validity and also revealed that absolute validity was obtained in the measurement sites in which physical constraints are imposed by engineering treatments  the integrative regression analysis confirms these outcomes and showed that the simulation system is a reliable predictor of the real speed data also in absolute terms  it was also found that the driving experience levels significantly affect the speed adopted by the motorists in the virtual environment  these findings support the use of the driving simulator as a powerful approach to predict of the safety effectiveness of design solutions in urban areas  thus allowing important cost savings   c  2017 elsevier ltd  all rights reserved  
 driving cycle prediction model based on bus route features bus fuel economy is deeply influenced by the driving cycles  which vary for different route conditions  buses optimized for a standard driving cycle are not necessarily suitable for actual driving conditions  and  therefore  it is critical to predict the driving cycles based on the route conditions  to conveniently predict representative driving cycles of special bus routes  this paper proposed a prediction model based on bus route features  which supports bus optimization  the relations between 27 inter station characteristics and bus fuel economy were analyzed  according to the analysis  five inter station route characteristics were abstracted to represent the bus route features  and four inter station driving characteristics were abstracted to represent the driving cycle features between bus stations  inter station driving characteristic equations were established based on the multiple linear regression  reflecting the linear relationships between the five inter station route characteristics and the four inter station driving characteristics  using kinematic segment classification  a basic driving cycle database was established  including 4704 different transmission matrices  based on the inter station driving characteristic equations and the basic driving cycle database  the driving cycle prediction model was developed  generating drive cycles by the iterative markov chain for the assigned bus lines  the model was finally validated by more than 2 years of acquired data  the experimental results show that the predicted driving cycle is consistent with the historical average velocity profile  and the prediction similarity is 78 69   the proposed model can be an effective way for the driving cycle prediction of bus routes   c  2017 published by elsevier ltd  
 driving on urban roads  how we come to expect the  correct  speed the subjective categories that drivers use to distinguish between different road types have been shown to influence the speeds they choose to drive but as yet we do not understand the road features that drivers use to make their discriminations  to better understand how drivers describe and categorise the roads they drive  55 participants were recruited to drive a video of familiar urban roads in a driving simulator at the speed they would drive these roads in their own cars  using the accelerator and brake pedal in the driving simulator to adjust their speed   the participants were then asked to sort photos of the roads they had just driven into piles so that their driving would be the same on all roads in one pile but different to the other piles  finally  they answered a series of questions about each road to indicate what speed they would drive  the safe speed for the road  their speed limit belief as well as providing ratings of comfort  difficulty and familiarity  overall  drivers  categorisation of roads was informed by a number of factors including speed limit belief  road features and markings  including medians   road width  and presence of houses  driveways and footpaths  the participants  categories were congruent with what they thought the speed limits were  but not necessarily the actual speed limits  mismatches between actual speed limits and speed limit beliefs appeared to result from category level expectations about speed limits that took precedence over recent experience in the simulator  roads that historically had a 50 km h speed limit but had been reduced to 40 km h were still regarded as 50 km h roads by the participants  underscoring the point that simply posting a sign with a lower speed limit is not enough to overcome drivers  expectations and habits associated with the visual appearance of a road  the findings provided insights into how drivers view and categorise roads  and identify specific areas that could be used to improve speed limit credibility  
 driving performance at lateral system limits during partially automated driving this study investigated driver performance during system limits of partially automated driving  using a motion based driving simulator  drivers encountered different situations in which a partially automated vehicle could no longer safely keep the lateral guidance  drivers were distracted by a non driving related task on a touch display or driving without an additional secondary task  while driving in partially automated mode drivers could either take their hands off the steering wheel for only a short period of time  10 s  so called  hands on  variant  or for an extended period of time  120 s  so called tands off  variant   when the system limit was reached  e g   when entering a work zone with temporary lines   the lateral vehicle control by the automation was suddenly discontinued and a take over request was issued to the drivers  regardless of the hands off interval and the availability of a secondary task  all drivers managed the transition tornanual driving safely  no lane exceedances were observed and the situations were rated as  harmless  by the drivers  the lack of difference between the hands off intervals can be partly attributed to the fact that most of the drivers kept contact to the steering wheel  even in the hands off condition  although all drivers were able to control the system limits  most of them could not explain why exactly the take over request was issued  the average helpfulness of the take over request was rated on an intermediate level  consequently  providing drivers with information about the reason for a system limit can be recommended  
 driving risk status prediction using bayesian networks and logistic regression the ability to identify driving risk status plays an important role for reducing the number of traffic accidents  bayesian networks  bns  was applied to extract the main factors that significantly influence driving risk status  five factors  driver state  sex  experience  vehicle state  and environment  were selected and considered to significantly influence driving risk status based on driving simulation experiments  next  a logistic regression algorithm was employed to establish the driving risk status prediction model  and the receiver operating characteristic curve was adopted to evaluate the performance of the prediction model  the area under the curve was 0 903  indicating that the prediction model was both adaptable and practical  in addition  this study also compared three different models  namely modelling directly  modelling based on expert experience  and modelling based on bn  the results indicated that modelling based on bn outperformed all other methods  the conclusions could provide reference evidence for driver training and the development of danger warning products to significantly contribute to traffic safety  
 driving simulation test for evaluating hazard perception  elderly driver response characteristics we created a driving simulation test for assessing drivers  hazard perception skills by measuring their palmar sweating response  psr   skin potential reflex  spr   and ability to operate the steering wheel  accelerator  and brake  we recruited 52 elderly people who were aged    60 years and were active drivers  these participants undertook the driving simulation test  and we measured their psr  spr  and device operation responses  psr tended to be greater in hazard scenes that involved anticipation or complexity processes  suggesting the involvement of factors such as the participants  readiness to anticipate hazards and their emotional changes  spr response was faster in hazard scenes that involved a surprise process  spr response was faster than braking response  except in scenes where the participants had only a fleeting moment to react to the hazard  suggesting that spr is a suitable evaluation index for hazard perception timing  two participants were suspected of having decreased cognitive function according to the mini mental state examination  these individuals exhibited psr and spr responses that were not consistent with the hazard scenes  and they made errors in their operation of the driving simulator  these findings highlight the need to examine the impact of decreased cognitive function on hazard perception   c  2017 elsevier ltd  all rights reserved  
 driving style for better fuel economy driving style has emerged as an important determinant of fuel economy  there is now evidence that driving style can be influenced to improve fuel economy as well as other aspects such as safety  however  it is not clear which are the most appropriate and influential factors that affect an individual s  or a group s  driving style with respect to improving fuel economy  in this paper  such factors were identified from the literature and by way of driver training programmes for fuel economy  the factors were then categorised under driver factors  operating the vehicle  vehicle dynamics and driver awareness  the influences of the factors on fuel economy were prioritised using a multi criteria analysis method called the analytical hierarchy process to determine their relative importance  it was found that driver awareness  measured in terms of culture change and better management  was considered the most influential category  the second most influential category of factors concerned operating the vehicle or vehicle control where acceleration and speed were dominant  the driver related factors were considered to have the least influence on fuel economy  the results can be used to improve interventions such as driver training by emphasising the most influential driving factors  
 driving under the influence of drugs  perceptions and attitudes of new zealand drivers this study explored the patterns of drug driving in new zealand by investigating 1  drivers  perceptions about impairment caused by legal and illegal drugs 2  countermeasures employed by drivers when under the influence of drugs  e g   decisions not to drive  3  drivers  attitudes about police enforcement of drug driving and 4  the factors that predict the likelihood of engaging in drug driving  participants  n   434  were licensed drivers who completed an online questionnaire  results of the questionnaire indicated that drivers rated hallucinogens and opiates as being the illegal drugs producing the highest level of driving impairment and cannabis the lowest  for legal drugs  sedatives were rated as having the highest driving impairment and anti nausea and anti depressants the lowest  respondents  drug use history had an effect on their ratings of impairment for anti anxiety drugs  anti depressants  kava  sedatives  cannabis and hallucinogens such that drug users reported higher impairment ratings than non user  making a decision not to drive after taking drugs was reported by users of alcohol  73 6    cannabis  57 0    strong painkillers  42 5    and anti depressants  10 0    respondents who reported drink driving were 3 26 times more likely to report drug driving than those reporting no drink driving  respondents also showed greater acceptance towards driving under the influence of legal drugs  43 5   compared to illegal drugs  10 3    those who did not have favourable attitudes about drug driving were less likely to report having driven under the influence of drugs  drivers in this sample were less aware of the potential negative effects of legal drugs on driving compared to illegal drugs  more than half the respondents from this study acknowledged drug driving as a road safety issue which needs more resources dedicated to it  
 driving with advanced vehicle technology  a qualitative investigation of older drivers  perceptions and motivations for use for older drivers  in vehicle technology offers much potential to improve safety and increase longevity of retaining both licensure and community mobility  however  little is known about how older drivers perceive advanced vehicle technologies  avts  based on everyday driving experience  interviews with 35 older drivers  20 men  15 women  aged 60 85 who owned a vehicle with at least two avts  e g   backup camera  lane departure warning  were conducted to explore the meanings that older drivers assigned to avts and motivations for use  including whether age related functional changes were part of their automobile purchase decision  findings indicate that age related changes are not a primary reason for why older adults seek out avts  but they still perceived and experienced avts to counteract age related changes in driving performance based upon changes they felt occurring within the body  older drivers also described avts as generating a sense of comfort behind the wheel  comfort with this technology was equated with convenience  ease of use  and increased feelings of safety  discussion emphasizes how assessments of the quality of driving performance and value of technology occur in relation to an aging body   c  2016 elsevier ltd  all rights reserved  
 dual signal roundabout evaluation in adelaide using sidra and aimsun in recent years  sidra software has been widely used in the evaluation of intersection performance due to its ease of application and accuracy of results  however  sidra has limitations when used for signal controlled roundabouts with signals on two or more approaches  in addition  only a few studies have investigated the performance of signalised roundabout controls  this research  therefore  explores signal operations on two approaches of the old belair road roundabout in adelaide  furthermore  a new method representing a roundabout using a four node intersection is proposed  and the modelling and calibration will be illustrated  in order to validate the developed model  the results from the four node intersection are compared with aimsun 7  the outcomes from the analysis demonstrate that the maximum queue length in each approach matches up to 95   whereas the delay time and the level of service in sidra are slightly higher than in aimsun 7  
 duration of commute travel changes in the aftermath of hurricane sandy using accelerated failure time modeling this paper used survey data from 397 commuters in the new york city area to determine the transportation related disruptions and socio demographic characteristics associated with the duration of home to work commute travel changes after hurricane sandy in 2012  the durations examined included those associated with working schedule location alterations  home to work trip delays  telecommuting time  and the alteration of commuting patterns  accelerated failure time fully parametric duration models  based on the weibull distribution were used  the models  significant variables differed  commuters with higher income or who were highly educated were more likely to prolong the time to return to normal working schedules and increase telecommuting duration  longer commutes under normal circumstances  based on trip time  prolonged trip delays and the number of days that the commute was changed  prolonged service recovery periods increased the duration of commute changes and delays  emphasizing the importance of timely transit service restoration  policies like gas purchase restrictions were found to have trade offs  since they can prolong the duration of commute changes and create queues at gas stations  telecommuting can allow commuters to keep their productivity levels high during post disaster periods   c  2017 elsevier ltd  all rights reserved  
 dutch politicians  use of cost benefit analysis 28 dutch politicians and 10 top level civil servants were interviewed about the way dutch politicians use cost benefit analysis  cba   various types of use were identified  politicians use cba   1  when forming their opinion about the desirability of transport projects   2  as political ammunition  opportunistic use    3  to make themselves and their decisions look more rational  symbolic use   none of the politicians stated that they solely base their judgment on cbas  politicians mention seven barriers that hamper the use of cba when forming their opinion   1  the process of forming an opinion is trivial   2  politicians prefer to form their opinion based on conversations rather than on reading reports   3  politicians don t trust cba s impartiality   4  politicians disagree with normative choices made in cba  an example of such a normative choice is that cba attaches an equally large weight to everybody s utility changes   5  politicians think that cba s explanatory power is limited   6  politicians receive cbas too late   7  when there is plenty of money  politicians care less about a project s social profitability  members of parliament identified barriers 3 and 6 as the most important barriers  they regard publishing cbas one or two months before a debate as the most auspicious solution for rectifying these barriers  an interesting observation is that no barriers for the opportunistic and symbolic use of cba by politicians were identified  hence  it can be concluded that it is highly likely that when politicians receive cbas for transport projects  they will use the cba in an opportunistic and symbolic way  but politicians will not necessarily use cba when forming their opinion  
 dynamic analysis of holiday travel behaviour with integrated multimodal travel information usage  a life oriented approach the integrated multimodal travel information  imti  plays an important role in the evolution process of holiday travel behaviour  which is seldom investigated  to fill this gap  this study analyses holiday travel behaviour dynamics with imti usage  based on the life oriented approach  imti usage is taken as a separate life domain in this study  and a two way relationship between holiday travel biography and imti usage biography over the life course  is examined after controlling for the effects of residential  household structure  employment education  and car ownership biographies  based on the web based life history survey data  statistical characteristics of mobilities in each life biography are first analysed  then  different random effects ordered logistic models are established to investigate the biographical interdependencies from three aspects  intra domain interdependency  inter domain interdependency and outer domain interdependency  the results show that the life biography is not only affected by a personal life course  but also affected by external background of the times  under the interaction of inner individual factors and outer environment factors  there is an obvious dynamic two way relationship between holiday travel biography and imti usage biography  meanwhile  residential  household structure  employment education and car ownership biographies have significant effects on these two life biographies  especially  the influence of long term state dependence for different life domains  over the life course  is much more obvious when explaining holiday travel behaviour dynamics and imti usage mobilities  therefore  the life oriented approach provides a valid method for analysing the dynamics of holiday travel behaviour with imti usage   c  2017 elsevier ltd  all rights reserved  
 dynamic carbon emission performance of chinese airlines  a global malmquist index analysis monitoring the carbon emission performance of chinese airlines helps inform targeted carbon reduction policies  this paper proposes a global malmquist carbon emission performance index  gmcpi   which can measure dynamic changes in total factor carbon emissions performance over time using a production frontier framework  the study then applied the proposed index to evaluate carbon emission performance of 12 chinese airlines from 2007 to 2013  the study also proposed bootstrapping gmcpi to perform statistical inferences on the gmcpi results  the empirical study generated in three meaningful findings  first  the carbon emission performance of the airlines improved by 11 93   mainly through technological progress  second  there were carbon emission performance differences among three different airline types  there was also a convergence of carbon emission performance  third  the most important factor influencing carbon emission performance was the air routes distribution  chinese airlines should consider improving carbon emission performance further  by establishing an evaluation system  enhancing communication and coordination among different airlines  adjusting the scale of airline development  and optimizing the air routes distribution   c  2017 published by elsevier ltd  
 dynamic clustering and propagation of congestion in heterogeneously congested urban traffic networks the problem of clustering in urban traffic networks has been mainly studied in static framework by considering traffic conditions at a given time  nevertheless  it is important to underline that traffic is a strongly time variant process and it needs to be studied in the spatiotemporal dimension  investigating the clustering problem over time in the dynamic domain is critical to better understand and reveal the hidden information during the process of congestion formation and dissolution  the primary motivation of the paper is to study the spatiotemporal relation of congested links  observing congestion propagation from a macroscopic perspective  and finally identifying critical pockets of congestion that can aid the design of peripheral control strategies  to achieve this  we first introduce a static clustering method to partition the heterogeneous network into homogeneous connected sub regions  the proposed framework guarantees connectivity of the cluster in different steps  which eases the development of a dynamic framework  the proposed clustering approach has 3 steps  firstly  it obtains a set of homogeneous connected components in the network  each component has a form of sequence which is built by sequentially adding neighboring links with similar level of congestion  secondly  the major skeleton of clusters is obtained out of this feasible set by minimizing a heterogeneity index  thirdly  a fine tuning step is designed to complete the clustering task by assigning the unclustered links of the network to proper clusters while keeping the connectivity  the optimization problem in both second and third step is formulated as a mixed integer linear programming  the approach is also extended to capture spatiotemporal growth and formation of congestion  the dynamic clustering is based on an iterative and fast procedure that considers the spatiotemporal characteristics of congestion propagation and identifies the links with the highest degree of heterogeneity due to time dependent conditions and finally re cluster them to guarantee connectivity and minimize heterogeneity  an implementation of the developed methodologies in a megacity based on more than 20 000 taxis with gps highlights the quality of the method due to its fast computation and proper integration of physical properties of congestion   c  2017 elsevier ltd  all rights reserved  
 dynamic continuum model with elastic demand for a polycentric urban city this paper presents the development of a macroscopic dynamic traffic assignment model for continuum transportation systems with elastic demand  a reactive dynamic user equilibrium model is extended to simulate network equilibrium problems for an urban area with multiple central business districts  cbds   each copy of traffic flow reactively makes route choice decisions to minimize the total travel cost from origin to destination  based on instantaneous traffic information from a radio broadcasting service or route guidance system  the elastic demand function for each copy of flow is associated with its total instantaneous travel cost  the model is solved by a cell centered finite volume method for conservation lawequations and a fast sweeping method for eikonal type equations on unstructured grids  numerical experiments for an urban traffic network with two cbds are presented to verify the rationality of the model and the validity of the numerical method  the numerical results indicate that the model captures some macroscopic characteristics of two copies of flow interacting in time varying urban transportation systems  e g   the spatial distributions of the flow density and flux and the path choice behavior in response to elastic demand  and can describe traffic equilibrium phenomena  such as self organization and traffic congestion build up and dissipation  
 dynamic equilibrium at a congestible facility under market power this paper studies equilibrium and optimum at a congested facility when firms have market power  e g   when a few airlines jointly use a congested airport  unlike most of the previous literature  we characterize the equilibrium in terms of timing of arrivals in a continuous time congestion model when firms simultaneously schedule services  using the henderson chu dynamic model of flow congestion in a multiple firm setting  we find that a stable and unique nash equilibrium in pure strategies always exists  importantly  it also exists in cases where it fails to exist under bottleneck congestion  notably when the value of schedule late exceeds the value of travel delays   we find that symmetric firms schedule arrivals inefficiently  and strongly concentrated around the desired arrival time so that the peak is shorter and delays are higher than socially optimal  we show that when firms are asymmetric in terms of output  all firms schedule vehicles in the peak center  around the desired arrival time  with arrival windows increasing with firm size such that a smaller firm s window is always fully contained in a larger firm s window and only the largest firm operates in the early and late shoulders  furthermore  for any pair of asymmetric firms  the larger firm has a higher instantaneous arrival rate at any moment where both firms schedule arrivals  our results also show that even though self internalization can be substantial  there is scope for decentralizing the first best outcome through time varying tolls   c  2017 elsevier ltd  all rights reserved  
 dynamic evolution of european airport systems in the context of low cost carriers growth airport systems adapted to the influx of low cost carriers  lcc  as the segment grew in prominence in the european market during the last decades  the generalised perspective that lccs are attached to remote secondary airports is being increasingly challenged by recent moves of the largest european lcc  the reality is that the impact of lccs has spread to most commercial airports in europe  primary and secondary alike  yet  despite valuable insights on the evolution of airline networks  the existing literature lacks a clear understanding of why this has occurred  this paper explains the dynamics in the evolution of airports systems that resulted in significant growth for the low cost segment in europe  a multiple case study involving 42 european airports was used to identify the mechanisms that triggered the traffic patterns leading to the ascendency of lccs in their respective airport systems  understanding these mechanisms may prove valuable for supporting airport strategic planning   c  2017 elsevier ltd  all rights reserved  
 dynamic life course analysis on residential location choice from a behavioral viewpoint  people choose where to live based on various factors  including their current situations  past experience  and plans for the future  some aspects of residential preference might be constant over time  inherited from the initial stage of life  and other parts might be responses to residential biography or other biographical domains like household structure  employment education  and travel  capturing these intertemporal dependences needs a life course analysis of residential location choices  however  a serious methodological gap exists between the perceived importance of dynamic life course analyses and quantitative modeling approaches  this study developed a dynamic choice model with cross sectional and longitudinal heterogeneities as well as discounted utility  called the du dclh model  to describe the decision making process for residential relocation by incorporating various intertemporal dependences over the life course  model parameters were estimated using data collected from a life history survey conducted in japan in 2010  the estimation results firstly confirm the effectiveness of the du dclh model for portraying the dynamics of residential mobility over a life course  next  it was found that previous experiences dominate decisions on residential location choice and can explain more than 75  of the total variations in choice  it was also revealed that as the mobility age increases  the influence of the past on their choices increases continuously  in contrast  the influence of the present situation is small and almost negligible  furthermore  the study empirically confirmed not only the influence of time constant and time varying preference for residential neighborhoods but also the specific influence of household biography  employment education biography  and travel biography  this study enriches the existing research by providing a systematic modeling framework incorporating broader behavioral mechanisms for residential location choice over the life course   c  2017 elsevier ltd  all rights reserved  
 dynamic macroscopic simulation of on street parking search  a trip based approach this paper extends a trip based aggregate dynamic traffic model to account for on street parking search  the trip based approach for a road network defined as a reservoir characterizes the internal traffic states by a macroscopic fundamental diagram  mfd  in speed while individualizing all vehicle travel distances  this paper first investigates distances to park for on street parking based on real data in lyon  france  and stochastic numerical experiments  an updated formulation compared to the existing literature is proposed for the relation between such distances and the parking occupancy  this new formulation is then incorporated into an event based numerical scheme that solves the trip based mfd model  the complete framework is able to account for different vehicle categories with respect to their parking strategies and to finely tune the related travel distances  finally  the capabilities of the full framework are illustrated based on three different scenarios  the first two correspond to strategies with static and dynamic  reactive  switch of the demand from on  to off street parking  while being very classical  they permit to demonstrate that the proposed model reacts as expected in such cases  the third scenario assesses the effect of a smart parking technology that informs the users when a free parking spot is available on one of the downstream links at each intersection  in such a case  the model permits to estimate the benefit for the equipped users but also the impacts on all other vehicle categories  the three scenarios highlight that the proposed framework is versatile and can quickly provide a first assessment with a low calibration burden of different parking strategies or policies   c  2017 elsevier ltd  all rights reserved  
 dynamic participation processes for policy packaging in transport backcasting studies scenario analysis is particularly useful when major changes are required to reach climate change goals over a longer time period  backcasting provides one approach to develop policy packages that together will help achieve these objectives  but one missing element has been the role that stakeholder engagement can play in the identification of suitable policy measures  in the packaging process  and in determining the suitability  the feasibility and the timescale involved  this paper develops a novel dynamic participatory process to address the policy implementation gap through the engagement of practitioners  policy makers and researchers in a series of workshops that allow these issues to be discussed in an open deliberative process  the spatial context taken is the andalusia region  spain   where there is a clear policy desire to implement a sustainable transport strategy for 2050  the paper outlines the methodological process  the development of the policy pathways  the dialogue process  the refinement of the policy pathways  the final strategy  and it then reflects on the usefulness of stakeholder engagement in the policy formulation process  
 dynamic programming decomposition for choice based revenue management with flexible products we reconsider the stochastic dynamic program of revenue management with flexible products and customer choice behavior as proposed by gallego et al   gallego g  iyengar g  phillips rl  dubey a  2004  managing flexible products on a network  working paper  columbia university  new york   in the scientific literature on revenue management  as well as in practice  the prevailing strategy to operationalize dynamic programs is to decompose the network by resources and solve the resulting one dimensional problems  however  to date  these dynamic programming decomposition approaches have not been applicable to problems with flexible products  because sold flexible products must be included in the dynamic program s state space and do not correspond directly to resources  in this paper  we contribute to the existing research by presenting a general approach to operationalizing revenue management with flexible products and customer choice in a dynamic programming environment  in particular  we reformulate the original dynamic program by means of fourier motzkin elimination to obtain an equivalent dynamic program with a standard resource based state space  this reformulation allows the application of dynamic programming decomposition approaches  numerical experiments show that the new approach has a superior revenue performance and that its average revenues are close to the upper bound on the optimal expected revenue from the choice based deterministic linear program  moreover  our reformulation improves the revenues by up to 8  compared to an extended variant of a standard choice based approach that immediately assigns flexible products after their sale  
 dynamic programming for the minimum tour duration problem the minimum tour duration problem  mtdp  is a variant of the traveling salesman problem with time windows  which consists of finding a time window feasible hamiltonian path minimizing the tour duration  we present a new effective dynamic programming  dp  based approach for the mtdp  when solving the traveling salesman problem with time windows with dp  two independent resources are propagated along partial paths  one for costs and one for earliest arrival times  for dealing with tour duration minimization  we provide a new dp formulation with three resources for which effective dominance and bounding procedures are applicable  this is a nontrivial task because in the mtdp at least two resources depend on each other in a nonadditive and nonlinear way  in particular  we define consistent resource extension functions  refs  so that dominance is straightforward using component wise comparison for the respective resource vectors  moreover  one of the main advantages of the new ref definition is that the dp can be reversed consistently such that the forward dp or any of its relaxations provide bounds for the backward dp  and vice versa  computational tests confirm the effectiveness of the proposed approach  
 dynamic resource allocation for intermodal freight transportation with network effects  approximations and algorithms this paper investigates a dynamic resource allocation problem  in which an intermodal operator attempts to determine the policy that characterizes the optimal quantities of each service product allowed to be sold during each time interval within a finite selling horizon  the problem is formulated as a markov decision process  mdp  model and a variety of mathematical programming models are developed to approximate the mdp model  a series of policies are obtained from the optimal solutions to the approximation models and theoretical results are provided to characterize the comparisons between the mdp model and the approximation models  various policies are further evaluated through theoretical analysis and simulation tests  we finally gain insights into the importance of the dynamic decisions  stochastic demands  model re solving  and integer variables in formulating approximation models   c  2017 elsevier ltd  all rights reserved  
 dynamical capacity drop in a nonlinear stochastic traffic model in this work  we show that the inverse lambda shape in the fundamental diagram of traffic flow can be produced dynamically by a simple nonlinear mesoscopic model with stochastic noises  the proposed model is based on the gas kinetic theory of the traffic system  in our approach  the nonlinearity leads to the coexistence of different traffic states  the scattering of the data is thus attributed to the noise terms introduced in the stochastic differential equations and the transition among the various traffic states  most importantly  the observed inverse lambda shape and the associated sudden jump of physical quantities arise due to the effect of stochastic noises on the stability of the system  the model parameters are calibrated  and a qualitative agreement is obtained between the data and the numerical simulations   c  2017 elsevier ltd  all rights reserved  
 dynamically interdependent business model for airline airport coexistence governments provide various forms of financial support for sustaining unprofitable regional airways  especially when such airways are essential to local livelihoods and economies  however  inefficient provision of subsidies has been subject to worldwide criticism  therefore  this study examines the load factor guarantee  a dynamically interdependent business model for airline airport coexistence where an airline and an airport agree on the load factor of a flight  after which either party compensates for any discrepancies between the actual and agreed upon load factor  the model is calibrated by using 2003 2014 data regarding noto airport and all nippon airways  and system dynamics are employed to model the dynamic interactions between the two parties  the findings show that successful coexistence between an airline and an airport hinges on the integral management of annual negotiations regarding the target load factor and the monthly demand adjustment of subsidies  in addition  although a subsidy represents a temporary financial loss for an airport  it is an effective way of maintaining long term  airline airport coexistence  this model is applicable to unprofitable airways worldwide  and it contributes to their sustainable management   c  2016 elsevier ltd  all rights reserved  
 early adopters of emergency braking and speed alert we analyse the characteristics of early adopters of two intelligent vehicle safety systems  emergency braking and speed alert  car users  experiences with the two systems and the characteristics of early adopters of the systems were studied with an online survey organised in five european countries  czech republic  finland  germany  the netherlands  and spain  all of the studied variables related to the user   gender  age  kilometres driven annually and monthly household income   had a statistically significant relationship with using emergency braking  gender  kilometres driven annually and monthly household income had a statistically significant relationship with using speed alert  for both systems  male drivers were more likely to be the first users of the systems  in general  the share of users having experienced the systems also increased with annual kilometrage and monthly household income  younger  18  to 44 year old drivers were found more likely to have used emergency braking than older  65  to 74 year old drivers  the results  however  suggest that respondents  annual kilometrage and monthly household income may be more strongly associated with using the systems than with age  
 easing the traffic  the effects of indonesia s fuel subsidy reforms on toll road travel indonesia has serious traffic jams  this study uses data from 19 indonesian toll roads over 2008 2015 to calculate the effects of indonesia s historic recent fuel subsidy reforms on motor vehicle travel  the timing of the reforms was determined by budgetary and political factors  providing a suitable setting for estimating a causal effect  we control for a broad set of other factors potentially influencing traffic flows  estimates using monthly data suggest an immediate fuel price elasticity of motor vehicle flows on the roads in our study of  0 1  increasing to  0 2 when responses over a year are considered  we estimate that indonesia s fuel subsidy reforms of 2013 and 2014 had reduced traffic pressure on these roads in the second half of 2015 by around 10  relative to the counterfactual without reform  a move to an adequate fuel excise system could contribute to more free flowing traffic  while generating revenue for infrastructure and other investment  
 eco driving key factors that influence fuel consumption in heavy truck fleets  a colombian case this research identifies key variables that influence fuel consumption that might be improved through eco driving training programs under three circumstances that have been scarcely studied before   a  heavy  and medium duty truck fleets   b  long distance freight transport  and  c  the latin american region  based on statistical analyses that include multivariate regression of operational variables on fuel consumption  the impacts of an eco driving training campaign were measured by comparing ex ante and ex post data  operational variables are grouped into driving errors  trip conditions  driver behavior  driver profile  and vehicle attributes  the methodology is applied in a freight fleet with nationwide transport operations located in colombia  where the steepness of its roads plays an important role in fuel consumption  the fleet  composed of 18 trucks  is equipped with state of the art real time data logger systems  during four months  517 trips traveling a total distance of 292 512 km and carrying a total of 10 034 tons were analyzed  the results show a baseline average fuel consumption  fc  of 1 716 liters per ton 100 km  a different logistics performance indicator  which measures fc in liters per ton transported each 100 km  shows an average of 3 115  after the eco driving campaign  reductions of 6 8  and 5 5  were obtained  drivers  experience  driving errors  average speed  and weight capacity ratio  among others  were found to be highly relevant to fc  in particular  driving errors such as acceleration  braking and speed excesses are the most sensitive to eco driving training  showing reductions of up to 96  on the average number of events per trip  
 economic and statistical perspectives on traffic safety in louisiana  2005 2015 introduction  this study examine and applies recent empirical evidence from mississippi and alabama on fatal crashes and its relationship with gasoline prices and alcohol consumptions using the louisiana crash data reports between january 2005 and december 2015  method  the negative binomial models is the preferred specification for the louisiana crash data  the marginal effects and related elasticities were calculated to facilitate the interpretation of the results  results  findings suggest that higher gasoline prices reduce fatalities among young drivers  a fewer number of young drivers on the roads are believed to reduce the likelihood of fatal crashes  underage drinking is still prominent in louisiana  extreme temperatures are positively associated with youth and other types of fatal crashes  practical applications  this study highlights a huge toll on society in terms of social and economic costs  wealth destruction  and unfulfilled potential of the deceased or incapacitated   c  2017 national safety council and elsevier ltd  all rights reserved  
 effect of integration of bicyclists and pedestrians with transit in new delhi traditionally  transportation mode shares in cities have been calculated separately for walking  bicycling and transit  however  it is well known that all transit trips have an access and egress component which is mostly executed through walking or bicycling  hence  the choice of whether to choose transit for a particular trip depends as much on the walking or bicycling component of the trip as the transit component itself  a major source of inaccuracy in traditional mode share estimation models is the failure to identify this inherent dependence of transit trips on bicycling and walking  in new delhi  where almost all access and egress trips for buses are made by bicycle walking  the inaccuracies in mode share estimation could be more significant  this research aims to study behavioral effects of integrating bicycling and walking infrastructure with transit and provide predictions for outcomes of policy implementations modifying bicycle to transit or walk to transit environment in new delhi  four policy variables each are selected that affect pedestrian access to transit  sidewalk width  lighting  crossings and surrounding hygiene  and bicycle access to transit  bicycle lane  bicycle parking  bicycle sharing and on board vehicle capacity  respectively  to gauge user behavior for hypothetical situations  stated preference survey data is collected through intercept surveys  90 respondents were interviewed with upto 10 choice scenarios per individual with a total of 897 scenario responses  461 pedestrian infrastructure scenarios  436 bicycle infrastructure scenarios   choice modelling is performed through a simple multinomial logit  mnl  model  in case there is no significant heterogeneity among individual preferences  and random taste mixed logit model  to incorporate significant heterogeneity among various types of individual preferences   modelling results showed that among pedestrian infrastructure  only presence of crossings could affect transit use and there is possibly significant heterogeneity in the population regarding use of sidewalks  among bicycle infrastructure variables  presence of bicycle lanes and bicycle sharing is expected to positively impact transit use with no significant heterogeneity among the population  finally  based on modelling results  three policy implementation scenarios are tested presence of pedestrian crossings near all transit stops  introduction of bicycle lanes throughout the city and introduction of bicycle sharing system throughout the city  the scenario analysis shows possibility of considerable rise in transit mode share and ghg emission savings  this motivates further research to corroborate these findings with a larger sample  evaluation of viability of the ideas and possibly investigating implementation details  
 effect of personality traits  age and sex on aggressive driving  psychometric adaptation of the driver aggression indicators scale in china this study aimed to assess the reliability and validity of the chinese version of the driver aggression indicators scale  dais   which measures aggressive driving behaviors  besides  demographic variables  sex and age  and the big five personality traits were examined as potential impact factors of aggressive driving  a total of 422 participants completed the dais  big five personality inventory  bfpi   and the socio demographic scale  first  psychometric results confirmed that the dais had a stable two factor structure and acceptable internal consistency  then  agreeableness and conscientiousness were negatively correlated with hostile aggression and revenge committed by the drivers themselves  while neuroticism was positively correlated with aggressive driving committed by the drivers themselves  meanwhile  more agreeable drivers may perceive less hostile aggression and revenge  more neurotic drivers may perceive more aggressive warning  finally  the effects of age and sex on aggressive driving were not same as most studies  we found that older age group perceived and committed more hostile acts of aggression and revenge than younger age groups  female drivers of 49 60 years perceived more aggressive warnings committed by other drivers  
 effect of physical effort on mental workload of cyclists in real traffic in relation to age and use of pedelecs to improve cycling safety  insight is required into the factors that contribute to road safety of older cyclists  from the wide range of possible factors  this paper addresses the role of physical effort on mental workload of cyclists with the aim to investigate whether physical effort affects mental workload of cyclists in real traffic in a field experiment  two instrumented bicycles  a conventional bicycle and a pedelec  were used  mental workload of cyclists in two age groups   30 45 years and 65 years and over   was measured by means of a secondary cognitive task requiring the detection and reaction to visual stimuli on a cycle route that varied in physical effort and task complexity  we expected physical effort to impair performance on the secondary task in complex traffic sections and not in simple sections  and that this impairment would be greater for older cyclists because of age related reduced muscle strength than for younger cyclists  we expected this impairment to be smaller if a pedelec was used  if such would be the case  this would indicate pedelecs to be beneficial for this older age group  because of a lower mental workload  our study confirmed that increased physical effort in complex traffic sections deteriorated the detection of relevant stimuli in both age groups  overall  older cyclists had longer reaction times and lower hit rates than younger cyclists  mental workloads of cyclists are basically the same when cycling on a conventional bicycle or on a pedelec  in theory  pedelecs may be beneficial to reduce physical effort in cycling in order to maintain enough mental capacity to handle complex traffic situations  however  this study did not demonstrate these benefits  as pedelecs are often used for longer trips  by elderly with low muscle strength  future studies should also explore the effect of higher physical effort over longer periods of time  and also specifically in elderly with low muscle strength   c  2016 elsevier ltd  all rights reserved  
 effectiveness and acceptability of milled rumble strips on rural two lane roads in sweden purpose the study sought to estimate the effects of centreline milled rumble strips on rural two lane roads in sweden in a wide perspective  traffic safety effects  i e   fewer crashes and injuries   driver experience  and driver opinions of centreline milled rumble strip usage on rural roads are investigated  methods to evaluate the traffic safety effects  an empirical bayes study comparing the outcome before and after the introduction of rumble strips was conducted  this study is based on data from 2003 2012 from the swedish national traffic accident database  strada  to capture driver experience and opinions about milled centreline rumble strips  focus groups and road side interviews were performed  results the results indicate a significant decrease in all types of severe injury crashes  a 20       13   reduction in the number of fatalities and seriously injured people  all crash types  and a 27       18   reduction in the number of fatalities and severely injured people in single vehicle crashes  participants in focus groups and road side interviews generally favoured centreline rumble strips on rural roads  and up to 90  of the interviewed motorcyclists and commuters stated that the rumble strips would help improve traffic safety  conclusions rumble strips in the centre of two lane rural roads are a countermeasure to help drivers who are unintentionally about to leave the lane  for example  due to sleepiness or inattention  based on the results of this study  installing centreline milled rumble strips on two lane rural roads 8 10 meters wide is a measure to consider to increase safety  
 effectiveness of policy incentives on electric vehicle acceptance in china  a discrete choice analysis the chinese government has introduced numerous policy incentives to promote the development and adoption of electric vehicles  evs   especially aggressive subsidization policies  stimulated by such policies  sales of evs exceeded 500 000 in 2016  however  the subsidies for evs will be abrogated after 2020  in order to maintain market stability  the ev related policy system needs innovation  nonetheless  it is still unclear how effective different policy incentives are  by conducting a discrete choice experiment involving 247 respondents and using a mixed logit model  this paper investigates the effectiveness of several potential policy incentives except subsidization policies  as well as the influence of socio psychologist determinants  the results help to offer suggestions for the ev related policy reformation  as expected  the probability of stated ev acceptance increases if policy incentives are provided in the choice experiment  evs are exempted from purchase restrictions  license plate control policy  and driving restrictions in china  and these two transport policy incentives have the most significant positive effects on the ev acceptance  discounted free electric charging also has great contribution  preferential bus lane access gains increasing attention  vehicle purchase tax exemption should be resumed because of its positive influence  comparatively speaking  the financial incentives  e g   reduced parking fees  in the ev using stage play a weaker role  
 effects of acute alcohol consumption on measures of simulated driving  a systematic review and meta analysis driving simulators are used in a wide range of research settings to help develop an understanding of driver behavior in complex environments  acute alcohol impairment is an important research topic for traffic safety and a large number of studies have indicated levels of simulated driving impairment imposed by alcohol across a range of performance outcome variables  the aim of the present study was to examine the impact of acute alcohol consumption on simulated driving performance by conducting a systematic review and meta analysis of the available evidence  the online databases pubmed  medline   web of science  via thomas reuters  and scopus were searched to identify studies that measured simulated car driving performance under control   no alcohol  or  placebo alcohol  ingestion  and intervention  acute alcohol ingestion  conditions  using repeated measures experimental designs  primary research outcomes were standard deviation of lane position  sdlp  and standard deviation of speed  sdsp    total number of lane crossings  lc  and average speed  speed  were secondary research outcomes   meta analytic procedures were used to quantify the effect of acute alcohol consumption on vehicle control  and to determine the influence of methodological variables  i e  the duration of the simulated driving task  the limb of the bac curve  ascending vs  descending  and the type of driving simulator employed  i e  car vs  pc based   on the magnitude of the performance change due to alcohol consumption  423 records were screened  and 50 repeated measures trials  n  962 participants  62  male  derived from 17 original publications were reviewed  37 trials  n   721 participants  used a  placebo alcohol  comparator to determine the effect of alcohol consumption on sdlp  32 37  and sdsp  22 37   alcohol consumption significantly increased sdlp by 4 0     0 5 cm  95  ci  3 0  5 1  and sdsp by 0 38     0 10 km h  1   95  ci  0 19  0 57   regression analyses indicate bac  p   0 004  and driving simulator platform  p  0 001  influence the magnitude of the sdlp change  such that higher bac levels and the use of pc based driving simulators were associated with larger performance decrements  r 2   0 80   the limb of the bac curve and the duration of the driving task did not significantly alter the magnitude of the performance change  eleven trials  n   205 participants  used a  no alcohol  comparator to measure the effect of alcohol consumption on sdlp  10 11   few trials assessed sdsp  3 11   alcohol consumption resulted in a small significant increase in sdlp under these conditions  standardized difference in means   0 23  95  ci  0 06  039   these results demonstrate that lateral  sdlp and lc  and longitudinal  sdsp  vehicle control measures in a driving simulator are impaired with acute alcohol consumption  however  sdlp appears to be a more sensitive indicator of driving impairment than other driving performance variables and the results of the present study support its use as a performance outcome when examining alcohol induced simulated driving impairment   c  2017 elsevier ltd  all rights reserved  
 effects of altruism and burnout on driving behavior of bus drivers personality traits predict driving behaviors  however  the mechanism underlying this relationship has not been adequately investigated in professional drivers  the current study investigated the relationship between altruistic personality and aberrant driving behaviors  and the potential role of burnout  a total of 194 bus drivers completed questionnaires including measures of altruism  burnout and aberrant driving behaviors  aggressive violations  ordinary violations  errors  and lapses   the results showed that altruism was negatively correlated with burnout  and with all the four subcategories of aberrant driving behavior  burnout fully mediated the relationship between altruism and aggressive violations  and partially mediated the relationship between altruism and lapses  these findings can be applied in the bus drivers  selection and interventions for burnout in order to improve the safety of public transport   c  2017 elsevier ltd  all rights reserved  
 effects of an integrated collision warning system on teenage driver behavior introduction  crash warning systems have been shown to provide safety benefits  but no studies have examined how teenagers respond  this study sought to find out whether young  inexperienced drivers change behavior in response to warnings  methods  forty 16 17 year olds drove an instrumented vehicle equipped with a system that warned for lane departures and potential rear end and lane change merge crashes  participants were randomly assigned to experimental or control groups  and their driving was monitored for 14 weeks during 2011 12  for the experimental group  this included a treatment period  when crash alerts were received by drivers  and baseline and post treatment periods  when warnings were recorded but not received  the control group never received warnings  data were analyzed to determine whether warnings were associated with changes in driving behavior  results  a total of 15 039 trips were analyzed  lane drifts accounted for 73  of warnings  forward collision warning rates doubled for all drivers during the treatment period and continued at an increased rate post treatment  this was likely a result of the fact that  as time went on  all drivers spent more time following vehicles at close distances  receiving alerts was associated with effects on following and lane changing behavior  including more time spent following at close distances  17    fewer lateral drifts  37   and fewer unsignaled lane changes  80    receiving warnings wasn t associated with an increased likelihood of engaging in secondary tasks  conclusions  warning systems may result in improved lane keeping and turn signal behaviors by novice drivers  but there is some indication they may result in more close following behaviors  practical applications  there is some evidence that lane departure warning may improve turn signal use for young drivers  while there is no evidence of safety benefits from the other types of warnings  there is some evidence of an increase in close following behavior but no increase in secondary tasks due to the presence of those capabilities   c  2017 national safety council and elsevier ltd  all rights reserved  
 effects of cargo types and load efficiency on airline cargo revenues numerous factors affect air cargo revenue management  air cargo companies base their cargo charges on whichever is the greater of gross weight or volumetric weight  we developed a cargo consolidation model based on air cargo characteristics  and investigated the effect of cargo density  the density ratio of heavy cargo to light cargo  drhl   and the percentage of small cargo on the chargeable weights and revenues of airlines  the empirical results show that a higher drhl indicates greater chargeable weight  and that as the drhl climbs to a certain level  the extent of chargeable cargo weights tends to stabilize gradually  the closer the cargo density approaches the most suitable loading density for a flight  the greater the chargeable weight is  a higher proportion of small cargo loaded on an aircraft means higher airline revenue  our results can effectively combine types of air cargo to increase loading rates and revenues for airlines   c  2015 elsevier ltd  all rights reserved  
 effects of directional auditory and visual warnings at intersections on reaction times and speed reduction times intersection collision warning systems  icwss  have an important impact on driving safety because making the potential collision at intersection predictable  allow reducing the probability and severity of accidents  among the several types of alarms to alert the driver of an imminent collision  those most used concerning the auditory and the visual stimulus  however  it is unclear whether is more effective an audio or a visual warning  in addition  no study compared the effects on drivers  behavior induced by an acoustic and a visual directional warning  the main objective of the present study was to assess  in response to a potential conflict event at the intersections  the effects of directional auditory and visual warnings on driving performance  a driving simulator experiment was carried out to collect drivers  behavior in response to a vehicle that failed to stop at the intersection  the parameters reaction time and speed reduction time were used for the evaluation of the effects on driving performance  these duration variables were modeled following the survival analysis  by the use of the accelerated failure time duration model with a weibull distribution  results showed that when the directional warning system  auditory or visual  was present  the drivers were able to detect earlier the violator vehicle  this effect led to a more comfortable braking maneuver and  thus  less possibilities of an unexpected maneuver for the following vehicle  avoiding the car following collisions  the effectiveness of icwss was more evident for the directional auditory speech message  for this condition  in fact  the lower reaction time and the longer speed reduction time were obtained  the outcomes of the present study provide useful suggestions about the most effective collision warning systems that the automotive industry should develop and equip on vehicles   c  2017 elsevier ltd  all rights reserved  
 effects of linear holding for reducing additional flight delays without extra fuel consumption this paper presents an approach to implement linear holding  lh  for flights initially subject to ground holding  in the context of trajectory based operations  the aim is to neutralize additional delays raised from the lack of coordination between various traffic management initiatives  tmis  and without incurring extra fuel consumption  firstly  motivated from previous works on the features of lh to absorb delays airborne  a potential applicability of lh to compensate part of the fixed ground holding is proposed  then  the dynamic adjustment of lh in response to tmis associated tactical delays is formulated as a multi stage aircraft trajectory optimization problem  addressing both pre  and post departure additional delays  results suggest that additional delays of 25 mins in a typical case study can be totally recovered at no extra fuel cost  a notable extent of delay reduction observed from the computational experiments further supports the benefits of lh for reducing different combinations of additional delays without consuming extra fuel   c  2017 elsevier ltd  all rights reserved  
 effects of local roads and car traffic on the occurrence pattern and foraging behaviour of bats the most negative impacts of roads on bats are increased mortality caused by collisions with vehicles  noise pollution reducing both communication and foraging  and barriers to movement  to test the effect of roads and traffic on the occurrence and foraging habits of bats in forested landscapes in western poland we compared 53 sites located along local asphalt roads of low to medium traffic volume with paired reference sites on unsurfaced forest roads  acoustical monitoring systems with anabat detectors were used at night to detect bats at all sites  overall  we found a strongly significant preference of bats for local asphalt roads  640 bat passes were recorded at asphalt roads but only 271 at reference sites  furthermore  significantly more bat taxa  longer activity and a greater frequency of feeding buzzes  calls used during foraging  were also recorded at asphalt roads  however  significant benefits were not shown for all species  this study clearly shows that local asphalt roads in forested landscapes are important foraging areas for several bat species  
 effects of metro transit on the ownership of mobility instruments in xi an  china most studies regarding the effects of rail transit on auto ownership have yet to disentangle the influences of the built environment surrounding stations and residential self selection from the impact of rail transit itself  there is also limited knowledge on the effects of rail investments in developing countries on ownership of mobility instruments  which has recently proliferated because of economic growth  using the 2014 data from xi an  this study explores the joint influences of metro transit on the ownership of autos  bikes  ebikes  and motorcycles  the cross sectional analysis shows that metro is negatively associated with auto ownership and ebike ownership whereas it has a positive association with bike ownership  the quasi longitudinal analysis indicates that moving into metro neighborhoods is negatively associated with the changes of auto and ebike ownerships  these results suggest that metro development helps curb the growth of autos and fight against the negative consequences of ebikes  and has the potential to achieve sustainable travel   c  2016 elsevier ltd  all rights reserved  
 effects of organizational complexity and resources on construction site risk introduction  our research is aimed at studying the relationship between risk level and organizational complexity and resources on constructions sites  our general hypothesis is that site complexity increases risk  whereas more resources of the structure decrease risk  a structural equation model  sem  approach was adopted to validate our theoretical model  method  to develop our study  957 building sites in spain were visited and assessed in 2003 2009  all needed data were obtained using a specific tool developed by the authors to assess site risk  structure and resources  construction sites risk assessment tool  or consrat   this tool operationalizes the variables to fit our model  specifically  via a site risk index  sri  and 10 organizational variables  our random sample is composed largely of small building sites with general high levels of risk  moderate complexity  and low resources on site  conclusions  the model obtained adequate fit  and results showed empirical evidence that the factors of complexity and resources can be considered predictors of site risk level  practical applications  consequently  these results can help companies  managers of construction and regulators to identify which organizational aspects should be improved to prevent risks on sites and consequently accidents   c  2017 national safety council and elsevier ltd  all rights reserved  
 effects of red light running camera systems installation and then deactivation on intersection safety introduction  the primary objective of this paper is to evaluate the safety impacts of red light running camera  rlc  system installation and then deactivation at 48 intersections in houston  texas  the second objective is to evaluate the spillover effect at nearby non treated intersections in houston after the deactivation  methods  to accomplish study objectives  an empirical bayes  eb  before after analysis was used  results  the results indicate statistically significant collision reductions on all red light running  rlr  crash types  37 percent  as well as right angle rlr crashes  47 percent  at the treated intersections after rlc activation  by way of comparison  the rlc deactivation analysis indicated that crashes increased by 20 percent for all rlr crash types and by 23 percent in right angle rlr crashes at the formerly treated intersections  after deactivation  all severity rlr crashes increased more than expected at nearby non treated intersections  which indicates the possibility of an adverse spillover effect  however  fatal injury crashes associated with rear end decreased after deactivation at both formerly treated and non treated intersections  although those rear end crashes account for smaller proportions when compared to all crash types right angle crashes  practical applications  overall  removing rlc treatments results in a negative reaction to the safety benefits that the treatment provides when it is in place and actively working and to the nearby intersections where the treatment has not been implemented  this study helps define the effects that rlcs have on safety at signalized intersections after installation and deactivation   c  2017 national safety council and elsevier ltd  all rights reserved  
 effects of risk aversion on competing shipping lines  pricing strategies with uncertain demands container shipping is facing severe overcapacity  fierce price based competition and high demand uncertainty  it is natural that some shipping lines may adopt a risk aversion attitude in their pricing strategies  this paper considers the pricing strategies of two competing ocean carriers facing uncertain demand  the first carrier is risk neutral with sufficient capacity  whereas the second carrier is risk averse with limited capacity  the conditional value at risk  cvar  is used to measure the risk averse attitude of the second carrier  a nash game model is formulated to model the pricing decisions and the equilibrium solution is obtained  we find that the pricing solution takes two forms  which can be determined by a threshold value of carrier 2 s capacity  under uniformly distributed demand  we show that as the second carrier becomes more risk averse  both carriers  optimal prices are decreasing  and the threshold value that determines the pricing strategy is also decreasing  we also analyze the impact of price sensitivity and competition intensity parameters on two carriers  price decisions under more specific conditions  a necessary and sufficient condition is established to determine whether two carriers  optimal prices would be positively or negatively affected by the competition intensity parameter  a range of numerical experiments are provided to illustrate the analytical results and explore their validity in more general cases  moreover  it is shown that the main analytical results in this paper can carry over to the cases when both carriers are risk averse   c  2017 elsevier ltd  all rights reserved

 effects of turning on and off red light cameras on fatal crashes in large us cities introduction  this study updates estimates of effects of activating red light cameras and offers a first look at effects of turning them off  method  among 117 large u s  cities with more than 200 000 residents in 2014  trends in city wide per capita rates of fatal red light running crashes and of all fatal crashes at signalized intersections were compared between 57 cities that initiated camera programs during 1992 2014 and 33 cities without cameras to examine effects of activating camera programs  trends also were compared between 19 cities that removed cameras and 31 regionally matched cities with continuous camera programs to evaluate effects of terminating camera programs  because several cities removed cameras during 2005 2008 and estimated effects might have been confounded by the subsequent economic downturn  primary analyses were limited to the 14 cities that removed cameras during 2010 2014 and 29 regionally matched cities with continuous camera programs  poisson regression examined the relationship of activating and deactivating cameras with fatal crash rates  results  after controlling for temporal trends in annual fatal crash rates  population density  and unemployment rates  rates of fatal red light running crashes and of all fatal crashes at signalized intersections were 21  and 14  lower  respectively  in cities with cameras after cameras were turned on than would have been expected without cameras  30  and 16  higher  respectively  in 14 cities that terminated cameras during 2010 2014 after cameras were terminated than expected had cameras remained  and 18  and 8  higher  respectively  in all 19 cities that removed cameras  but not significantly  conclusions  this study adds to the body of evidence that red light cameras can reduce the most serious crashes at signalized intersections  and is the first to demonstrate that removing cameras increases fatal crashes  practical applications  communities thinking about removing cameras should consider impacts to safety   c  2017 national safety council and elsevier ltd  all rights reserved  
 effects of upgrading to cycle highways   an analysis of demand induction  use patterns and satisfaction before and after objective  the objective of the present study is to investigate the effects of improvements made to two large  interconnected bicycle infrastructure in the western suburbs of copenhagen  denmark  on bicycle volumes and mode share  and cyclists  behaviour  perceptions  and experiences  methods  effects are assessed by analysing data from automatic counting stations during 35 months to measure the changes in bicycle volumes on the investigated routes  furthermore  a questionnaire survey repeated three times   before  and one and two years after opening the improved routes   is used  findings are supported by a control survey at a nearby facility  which was not influenced by the infrastructure improvements  results  the investments related to the two investigated cases of infrastructure improvements resulted in a significant increase in the volume of bicyclist two years after the improvements  on one of the routes  the  albertslund route   on weekdays during the rush hour in daylight  an increase from 126 to 203 bicyclists h was recorded  whereas an increase from 24 to 32 bicyclists h was recorded at  vestvolden  for the same period  most of the increase could be attributed to relocation of bicyclists from other routes  induced cycling trips   trips that were not previously made by bicycle   were estimated to account for only 4 5  of the bicyclists two years after improvements  bicyclists using the improved route express an increase in satisfaction with the quality of the facilities  which is significantly higher than at the control site  conclusion  data from the counting stations provides useful information if measured over a long period  this is necessary to correct for factors such as climate effects and temporal variation  investments in cycle infrastructure in the investigated case led to a higher number of bicyclists who were mainly relocated from other routes  a minor increase in the modal share of cyclists was observed two years after the infrastructure improvements  furthermore  the investments resulted in a higher degree of satisfaction among active bicyclists  if measured over a longer period  this could lead to a higher modal share due to a potential social advertising effect  
 efficient and fair system states in dynamic transportation networks this paper sets out to model an efficient and fair transportation system accounting for both departure time choice and route choice of a general multi od network within a dynamic traffic assignment environment  firstly  a bi level optimization formulation is introduced based on the link based traffic flow model  the upper level of the formulation minimizes the total system travel time  whereas the lower level captures traffic flow propagation and the user equilibrium constraints  then the bi level formulation is relaxed to a linear programming formulation that produces a lower bound of an efficient and fair system state  an efficient iterative algorithm is proposed to obtain the exact solution  it only requires solving one linear program in one iteration  further  it is shown that the number of iterations is bounded  and the output traffic flow pattern is efficient and fair  finally  two numerical cases  including a single od network and a multi od network  are conducted to demonstrate the performance of the algorithm  the results consistently show that the departure rate pattern generated from the algorithm leads to an efficient and fair system state  and the algorithm converges within two iterations across all test scenarios   c  2017 elsevier ltd  all rights reserved  
 elderly travel frequencies and transport mode choices in greater rotterdam  the netherlands demographic ageing is a key societal challenge in europe as well as in many other western and non western societies  a crucial dimension concerns elderly daily mobility patterns  while still partaking fewer and shorter trips than younger generations  today s elderly have been found increasingly  auto mobile  although the elderly benefit from the independence  freedom of movement  and social inclusion  concerns may rise regarding the environmental and accessibility impacts of this induced mobility  the present study adds to the expanding literature on elderly mobility  an integrated analysis of the effects of socio demographic  health  trip  spatial and weather attributes on elderly mobility  utilizing travel diary data for greater rotterdam  the netherlands  trip frequencies and transport mode choices of the elderly are analysed by means of zero inflated negative binomial models as well as multinomial logit regression models  and contrasted to the non elderly subpopulation to explore  dis similarities  while the results show common determinants  the models also highlight important differences in the magnitude of the estimated coefficients and factors only influencing transport patterns for the elderly  embedded in the context of an aging population  the empirical findings assist policy makers and planners in several respects  for transportation plans and programs it is critical to recognize mobility needs of the elderly  as the seniors are becoming increasingly automobile  the results call for strategies to encourage older people to use more physically active and environmentally friendly transport modes such as public transport  walking and cycling  
 elderly s heterogeneous responses to topographical factors in travel mode choice within a hilly neighborhood  an analysis based on combined gps and paper based surveys because of the decline of physical abilities of the elderly  their mobility is more vulnerable to topographical factors than younger population groups  however  topographical factors have been neglected in studies on travel behavior  and elderly people s heterogeneous responses to topographical factors remain unknown  to fill this research gap  this study focuses on a hilly neighborhood called koyo newtown in hiroshima city  japan  where a multi period  two waves  and multi day  two weeks  panel survey was conducted in 2010 and 2011  the survey consisted of a gps survey and a paper based travel diary survey  in addition  a travel mode choice model is developed based on a panel mixed logit model  heterogeneities are captured by introducing random effects to parameters of topographical factors  which are measured in terms of altitude difference  intensity of up down movement  maximum slope  and changing slope  furthermore  effects of introducing personal mobility vehicles  pm  to mitigate negative impacts of topographical factors are also evaluated  as a result  it is found that the altitude difference and maximum slope factors have significant impacts on mode choice decisions  the effectiveness of pm to support the mobility of elderly residents is also confirmed  
 electric vehicle charging choices  modelling and implications for smart charging services the rollout of electric vehicles  ev  occurring in parallel with the decarbonisation of the power sector can bring uncontested environmental benefits  in terms of co2 emission reduction and air quality  this roll out  however  poses challenges to power systems  as additional power demand is injected in context of increasingly volatile supply from renewable energy sources  smart ev charging services can provide a solution to such challenges  the development of effective smart charging services requires evaluating pre emptively ev drivers  response  the current practice in the appraisal of smart charging strategies largely relies on simplistic or theoretical representation of drivers  charging and travel behaviour  we propose a random utility model for joint ev drivers  activity travel scheduling and charging choices  our model easily integrates in activity  based demand modelling systems for the analyses of integrated transport and energy systems  however  unlike previous charging behaviour models used in integrated transport and energy system analyses  our model empirically captures the behavioural nuances of tactical charging choices in smart grid context  using empirically estimated charging preferences  we present model estimation results that provide insights into the value placed by individuals on the main attributes of the charging choice and draw implications charging service providers   c  2017 the authors  published by elsevier ltd  
 electric vehicle users and their travel patterns in greater stockholm electric vehicles  evs  show promise for improving the environmental sustainability of the transport system since  as opposed to conventional vehicles  they have no tailpipe exhaust gas emissions  the use of evs can also decrease the amount of greenhouse gas emissions  especially if the electricity has been generated with renewable energy sources  however  the scale of projected benefits can be questioned since the travel patterns of car drivers may not stay the same after changing to evs  due to various factors such as higher investment costs  lower operation costs and general perceptions associated with electric vehicles  in this study  the travel patterns of both electric vehicle users and conventional vehicle users in greater stockholm are compared with regard to the number of trips made and the modal share of the car in the total travel distance  for this purpose  a one day travel diary carried out in autumn 2014 has been used  the main findings are the following  firstly  the ev is generally perceived by respondents to be more environmentally friendly than public transport modes  secondly  ev users make significantly more trips than their non ev using counterparts  according to their one day travel diaries and controlling for socio economic and situational variables  thirdly  ev users choose the car for a significantly larger percentage of their total travel distance than conventional vehicle users  those observations would suggest a rebound effect  as evs still consume a considerable amount of energy and contribute to other external effects such as congestion   c  2017 elsevier ltd  all rights reserved

 electric vehicles for greenhouse gas reduction in china  a cost effectiveness analysis there have been ongoing debates over whether battery electric vehicles contribute to reducing greenhouse gas emissions in china s context  and if yes  whether the greenhouse gas emissions reduction compensates the cost increment  this study informs such debate by examining the life cycle cost and greenhouse gas emissions of conventional vehicles  hybrid electric vehicles and battery electric vehicles  and comparing their cost effectiveness for reducing greenhouse gas emissions  the results indicate that under a wide range of vehicle and driving configurations  range capacity  vehicle use intensity  etc    battery electric vehicles contribute to reducing greenhouse gas emissions compared with conventional vehicles  although their current cost effectiveness is not comparable with hybrid electric vehicles  driven by grid mix optimization  power generation efficiency improvement  and battery cost reduction  the cost effectiveness of battery electric vehicles is expected to improve significantly over the coming decade and surpass hybrid electric vehicles  however  considerable uncertainty exists due to the potential impacts from factors such as gasoline price  based on the analysis  it is recommended that the deployment of battery electric vehicles should be prioritized in intensively used fleets such as taxis to realize high cost effectiveness  technology improvements both in terms of power generation and vehicle electrification are essential in improving the cost effectiveness of battery electric vehicles  
 electrically assisted bikes  potential impacts on travel behaviour this paper reports on a review of the european literature about the impacts of having an electrically assisted bike available to use  together with results from a trial in the uk city of brighton  where 80 employees were loaned an electrically assisted bike for a 6 8 week period  in the brighton trial  three quarters of those who were loaned an e bike used them at least once a week  across the sample as a whole  average usage was in the order of 1520 miles per week  and was accompanied by an overall reduction in car mileage of 20   at the end of the trial  38  participants expected to cycle more in the future  and at least 70  said that they would like to have an e bike available for use in the future  and would cycle more if this was the case  this is consistent with the results of the european literature which shows that when e bikes are made available  they get used  that a proportion of e bike trips typically substitutes for car use  and that many people who take part in trials become interested in future e bike use  or cycling more generally   c  2017 trl limited  university of brighton and other collaborating authors  published by elsevier ltd  all rights reserved  
 electronic ticketing systems as a mechanism for travel behaviour change  evidence from sydney s opal card smartcard and other forms of electronic ticketing have become integral to modern public transport systems  while aggregate ridership figures have generally been positive  little is known about the drivers behind these changes because of a lack of travel information on individuals before and after implementation of such systems  the current paper presents analysis from a naturalistic travel behaviour study of inner city sydney residents that coincided with the phased introduction of the opal smartcard system  using a differences indifferences methodology  results indicate significant reductions in car use of around 10 min day with commensurate increases in train use and incidental walking  this trend holds across income groups and is more pronounced for older residents  results add further weight to the merits of simplifying ticket purchasing as part of a package of policy measures designed to increase public transport usage   c  2017 elsevier ltd  all rights reserved  
 emergency department visits by pediatric patients sustained as a passenger on a motorcycle objective  currently only 5 out of the 50 states in the united states have laws restricting the age of passengers permitted to ride on a motorcycle  this study sought to characterize the visits by patients under the age of 16 to u s  emergency departments  eds  for injuries sustained as a passenger on a motorcycle methods  in this retrospective cohort study  data were obtained from the nationwide emergency department sample  neds  for the years 2006 to 2011  pediatric patients who were passengers on a motorcycle that was involved in a crash were identified using international classification of diseases  ninth revision  icd 9  external cause of injury codes  we also examined gender  age  disposition  regional differences  common injuries  and charges results  between 2006 and 2011 there were an estimated 9 689 visits to u s  eds by patients under the age of 16 who were passengers on a motorcycle involved in a crash  the overall average patient age was 9 4years  and they were predominately male  54 5    the majority  85   of these patients were treated and released  the average charges for discharged patients were  2 116 50 and amounted to roughly  17 500 000 during the 6years  the average cost for admission was  51 446 per patient and totaled over  54 million  the most common primary injuries included superficial contusions  sprains and strains  upper limb fractures  open wounds of head  neck  and trunk  and intracranial injuries conclusion  although there were only about 9 700 visits to u s  eds for motorcycle crashes involving passengers less than 16years old for 2006 to 2011  the total cost of visits that resulted in either ed discharge or hospital admission amounted to over  71 million  
 emission factors of inorganic ions from road traffic  a case study from the city of naples  italy  pm10 samples were collected in the urban tunnel of naples  southern italy  during a monitoring campaign on march 2015  two sets of samples were collected at both sides of the tunnel  each set representing the daily cycle at a 1 h time resolution  distance based mass per kilometer emission factors  efs  were calculated using mass concentrations  traffic flow rates and wind speed as a function of fleet composition  samples were analysed for mass and water soluble inorganic ions  na  nh4  k  ca2  mg2  cl  no3  and so42   with the aim of investigating the influence of road traffic on the contribution of these species to pm levels  road traffic directly emits inorganic ions  both from the exhaust and non exhaust components  analysis of ionic composition highlighted the increase in calcium concentration  which may derive from non exhaust sources  road dust  wear of brake pads  clutches  tires  and calcium sulfonates  phenates or salicylates  often added to motor oils  sulphate  added to lubricant oils  is also directly emitted at a rate higher than the gaseous sulphur dioxide emission  according to our analysis  nearly 10  of pm mass is composed by water soluble inorganic ions  most of which directly emitted by automobiles  this suggests that an important contribution to pm emissions may derive from the inorganic component and more efforts should be devoted to constrain these emissions if pm concentration had to effectively comply with air quality standards

 emotional intelligence and risky driving behaviour in adults background  risky driving is considered a key predictive factor in road traffic accidents resulting in morbidity and mortality  intra individual emotional and personality factors have been shown to influence risk taking behaviours among drivers  despite this  there is limited research investigating the individual dimensions of these constructs and their relationship to risky driving behaviour  rdb   the current study therefore aimed to assess whether the individual dimensions of emotional intelligence  el  were implicated in rdb  methods  the sample comprised 179 adults  55  male  aged between 18 and 64 years  m   29 85  sd   11 46  and who currently held a valid driver s licence completed an online survey  emotional intelligence was assessed via self report using the swinburne university emotional intelligence test  sueit   and rdb was measured using both the brief distracted driving scale  bdds  and the dula dangerous driving index  dddi   results  regression analyses revealed that  risky driving  was related to greater levels of emotional recognition and expression and lesser age  f  6 f  172    2 27  p   0 05  r 2   7 3    and the negative emotions sub scale of dddi  was significantly predicted by emotional control and age  f  6 f  172    6 41  p   0 05  r 2   18 3    a mediation model incorporating age  emotional control scores and the negative emotions driving behaviour score indicated that a significant indirect effect of age through emotional control  k 2   0 08  95  ci   0 02   0 03     h  3    10 98  p   0 012   conclusions  lower scores on specific indices of ei are associated with increased rates of rdb  suggesting that poor emotional control may impede an individuals  ability to make safe behavioural decisions when driving  the effect sizes for these models were small  however  and further research is needed to explore the contributory components in this association  greater awareness of the role of emotional regulation and driving behaviours may be useful in preventing rdb in adults   c  2017 elsevier ltd  all rights reserved  
 emotions  behaviour  and the adolescent driver  a literature review background  the intractable global road safety problem of the overrepresentation of young drivers in road crashes  despite a plethora of intervention  suggests that innovative approaches to understanding and thus intervening in road crash risks is required  the current research recognises that young drivers frequently are adolescents  and that adolescence is characterised by rapid physical  psychological  cognitive  and social development  each of which interacts with  contributes to  and is impacted upon by a wealth of negative  neutral and positive moods and emotions  the literature regarding relevant to adolescent drivers and emotions between 1 january 2005 and 30 september 2015 will be synthesise  in addition to posing future research questions regarding adolescents  emotions  and driving behaviour  results  one hundred and three peer reviewed articles were identified  and these were summarised within emotions and the adolescent  44 papers   emotions  the adolescent  and driving risks  23 papers   emotions  the adolescent  and risky driving behaviour  30 papers   and emotions  the adolescent  and road safety interventions  6 papers   the findings were synthesised within the context of the characteristics of the adolescent driver  their emotions  the driving context and their driving behaviour  including a pictorial representation of two temporal models depicting the sequence via which emotions can impact upon adolescent driving behaviour  path a in which the adolescent driver experiences emotions after entering the car  path b in which the adolescent experiences emotions before entering the car   discussion and implications  the relatively recent proliferation of literature pertaining to adolescents  emotions  and their driving behaviour suggests that the breadth of research questions posed in relation to the domains of the adolescent driver  their emotions  the driving context  and their driving behaviour are timely  indeed  recent applications of systems thinking within road safety  including young driver road safety specifically  maintain that a holistic approach to the understanding of who plays what role in this system that currently contributes to crash risks  and conversely can play a role in effective and efficient intervention  is essential before the real world realisation of a safe road system  addressing these research questions are fundamental to sustaining progress on the path to young driver road crash prevention through a safe young driver road safety system   c  2017 elsevier ltd  all rights reserved  
 empirically quantifying city scale transportation system resilience to extreme events this article proposes a method to quantitatively measure the resilience of transportation systems using gps data from probe vehicles such as taxis  the granularity of the gps data necessary for the method is relatively coarse  it only requires coordinates for the beginning and end of trips  the metered distance  and the total travel time  the method works by computing the historical distribution of pace  normalized travel times  between various regions of a city and measuring the pace deviations during an unusual event  periods of time containing extreme deviations are identified as events  the method is applied to a dataset of nearly 700 million taxi trips in new york city  which is used to analyze the city transportation infrastructure resilience to hurricane sandy  the analysis indicates that hurricane sandy impacted traffic conditions for more than five days  and caused a peak delay of two minutes per mile  practically  it identifies that the evacuation announcements coincided with only minor disruptions  but significant delays were encountered during the post disaster response period  since the implementation of this method is very efficient  it could potentially be used as an online monitoring tool  representing a first step toward quantifying city scale resilience with coarse gps data   c  2017 published by elsevier ltd  
 empirics of multi modal traffic networks   using the 3d macroscopic fundamental diagram traffic is multi modal in most cities  however  the impacts of different transport modes on traffic performance and on each other are unclear   especially at the network level  the recent extension of the macroscopic fundamental diagram  mfd  into the 3d mfd offers a novel framework to address this gap at the urban scale  the 3d mfd relates the network accumulation of cars and public transport vehicles to the network travel production  for either vehicles or passengers  no empirical 3d mfd has been reported so far  in this paper  we present the first empirical estimate of a 3d mfd at the urban scale  to this end  we use data from loop detectors and automatic vehicle location devices  avl  of the public transport vehicles in the city of zurich  switzerland  we compare two different areas within the city  that differ in their topology and share of dedicated lanes for public transport  we propose a statistical model of the 3d mfd  which estimates the effects of the vehicle accumulation on car and public transport speeds under multi modal traffic conditions  the results quantify the effects of both  vehicles and passengers  and confirm that a greater share of dedicated lanes reduces the marginal effects of public transport vehicles on car speeds  lastly  we derive a new application of the 3d mfd by identifying the share of public transport users that maximizes the journey speeds in an urban network accounting for all motorized transport modes   c  2017 the authors  published by elsevier ltd

 energy consumption effects of speed and acceleration in electric vehicles  laboratory case studies and implications for drivers and policymakers the number of electric vehicles in service throughout the world has increased from a few thousand in 2009 to some 740 000 in december 2014  these vehicles are often seen as a means of reducing climate and health damaging emissions  and their development is directly supported by some countries and endorsed by the eu  aside from questions of rebound effects  embedded emissions and cleanness of electricity generation  there are unanswered questions about the energy performance of such cars under a range of driving conditions  and the results of existing studies are not easily interpretable by policymakers and drivers  this study uses the results of extensive dynamometer tests on eight commonly sold electric vehicles  it develops a multivariate model  with regression coefficients around 0 97  to map power demand and energy consumption for all likely combinations of speed and acceleration  producing accessible  easily interpretable displays  while electric vehicles are frequently marketed on the basis of their high acceleration  an important finding is that episodes of modest to high acceleration severely compromise their range and energy efficiency  regardless of speed  this also raises questions as to how well such vehicles perform in the erratic driving conditions of urban traffic   c  2017 elsevier ltd  all rights reserved

 equity and social acceptability in multiple hazardous materials routing through urban areas in this article we study the problem of routing hazardous materials  hazmat  form an origin to a destination on an urban transportation network in which the arcs lay on irregular zones with different population densities  hazmat are transported on a regular basis instead of a single shipment  in addition  different types of hazmat  posing different levels of risk  must be transported at the same time  we developed a methodology to incorporate the concept of equity in the spatial distribution of risk when multiple types of hazmat must be distributed along various simultaneous routes including not only the risk added by the transportation process but also other baseline risks from exogenous sources  the article describes the development of a multi product multi shipment hazmat routing model with equity constraints  departing from a theoretically rich single product single shipment hazmat routing model found in the literature  aimed to minimize the conditional expectation of the consequence of a catastrophic accident  the resultant modeling approach is a linear fractional programming model that incorporates a flexible set of linear constraints that allow a fair distribution of risk among populated zones  restricting the total level of risk below a socially acceptable threshold  we applied this modeling framework to two hypothetical examples and to an actual case in santiago  chile  a large capital city with over 6 million inhabitants  showing to be both mathematically tractable and useful for decision makers in practice   c  2016 elsevier ltd  all rights reserved  
 ergonomics assessment of locally fabricated passenger seats in trotro vehicles in accra  ghana trotro vehicles constitute one of the major means of transportation in ghana by way of ferrying people and goods  most trotros are originally brought into the country as load carrying vehicles  which are then converted into passenger vehicles  locally designed seats are then fabricated and secured into the vehicles  the study explored the ergonomic evaluation of the locally fabricated passenger seats with anthropometric measures of passengers and also compared the seat dimensions to required standards  the study was undertaken at seven selected bus stations in accra  the capital city of ghana  the study composed of 307 volunteer passengers comprising 175 females and 132 males with ages spanning from 18 to 60 years  the dimensions of ninety locally fabricated seats were collected from ninety randomly selected trotro vehicles  ergonomic assessment was performed to determine match or mismatch between the anthropometric measures and vehicle seating dimensions  in addition  the fabricated seat dimensions were compared to both local and international vehicle seat standards  high mismatches indicating that the passenger seats were probably too deep or too high were observed for seat height popliteal height  seat depth buttock popliteal length  and seat breadth hip breadth  a low mismatch was observed between the sitting height and backrest height for 99 4  of participants  only four and ten out of the ninety seats complied with specified standard seat length and backrest to backrest distance  respectively  the high prevalence of mismatch is a possible indication that most locally fabricated seats do not adequately accommodate majority of passengers  furthermore  it appears that anthropometric measures and standard vehicle seat dimensions are not considered during seat design  with potential health ramifications pertaining to the safety  comfort and sitting posture of passengers  
 estimating fuel burn impacts of taxi out delay with implications for gate hold benefits the aviation community is actively investigating initiatives to reduce aircraft fuel consumption from surface operations  as surface management strategies may face fewer implementation barriers compared with en route strategies  one fuel saving initiative for the air transportation system is the possibility of holding aircraft at the gate  or the spot  until the point at which they can taxi unimpeded to the departure runway  the extent to which gate holding strategies have financial and environmental benefits hinges on the quantity of fuel that is consumed during surface operations  a pilot of an aircraft may execute the taxi procedure on a single engine or utilize different engine thrust rates during taxi because of a delay  in the following study  we use airline fuel consumption data to estimate aircraft taxi fuel consumption rates during the  unimpeded  and  delayed  portions of taxi time  we find that the fuel consumption attributed to a minute of taxi out delay is less than that attributed to minute of unimpeded taxi time  for some aircraft types  the fuel consumption rate for a minute of taxi delay is half of that for unimpeded taxi  it is therefore not appropriate  even for rough calculations  to apply nominal taxi fuel consumption rates to convert delayed taxi out time into fuel burn  on average we find that eliminating taxi delay would reduce overall flight fuel consumption by about 1   when we consider the savings on an airport by airport basis  we find that for some airports the potential reduction from reducing taxi delay is as much as 2    c  2016 elsevier ltd  all rights reserved  
 estimating level of service of mid block bicycle lanes considering mixed traffic flow the primary objective of the study was to identify the factors that influenced the comfort perception of e bike  e scooter and bicycle riders in mid block bicycle lanes on urban streets and to estimate the bicycle level of service  blos  of a mid block bicycle lane with mixed two wheeled traffic  data were collected at thirty locations on thirty different streets in nanjing area in china  pearson s chi square tests were conducted to make comparisons of the comfort perception among different cyclist groups  the factors that significantly affected the comfort perception of the cyclists included the age of the cyclists  the type of two wheeled vehicles  the volume of two wheeled vehicles  the width of mid block bicycle lanes  the proportions of e bikes and e scooters in two wheeled vehicles  the physical separation between motorized  bicycle and pedestrian lanes  the slope of bicycle lanes  the roadside access points and the roadside land use  ordered probit models were developed to quantitatively evaluate the impacts of different contributing factors on the comfort perception of the riders of e bikes  e scooters and bicycles  the results showed that compared to the riders of bicycles  the riders of e bikes and e scooters were more likely to perceive a poor comfort level  the comfort perception of the cyclists increased with an increase in the width of the mid block bicycle lane  whereas it decreased with an increase in the volume of two wheeled vehicles  the proportions of e bikes and e scooters in two wheeled vehicles negatively affected the comfort perception of the cyclists  in addition  the presence of physical separation between the motorized  bicycle and pedestrian lanes significantly increased the comfort perception of the cyclists  with the comfort perception models  a procedure was developed and insights were gained to help transportation professionals estimate the blos of a mid block bicycle lane with mixed two wheeled traffic   c  2017 elsevier ltd  all rights reserved  
 estimating pedestrian demand for active transport evaluation and planning this article presents a recently developed walkability based approach to evaluating the built environment s relationship to pedestrian activity  as well as the application of this evaluation in generating a model of pedestrian demand across london derived from built environment indicators  the approach is novel in its integration of space syntax measures to evaluate network accessibility and the use of volume area ratios to measure land use intensity  it utilises high resolution geographic data surfaces for the generation of the built environment variables  the advantage of using this method is that it allows greater analytical flexibility in transport policy and practice  where the ability to compare the analytical results to other social and spatial indicators is vital for decision making  pedestrian density data covering the whole of greater london are used to test the performance of the variables  the best performing variables are then analysed to determine their weighting in a model of pedestrian demand for london based on the selected built environment indicators  randomised testing shows that the model is capable of reliably predicting pedestrian demand  it can be used to estimate pedestrian demand both currently and for future scenarios by quantify future changes to the built environment  and thus enabling walking to be quantitatively assessed in the same way as motorised modes  the model can be applied to active travel infrastructure planning and policy evaluation  from the scale of the street or intersection  to larger administrative units  the model also has wider theoretical and policy implications that relate to the spatial structuring of london   c  2017 elsevier ltd  all rights reserved  
 estimating railway rail service life  a rail grid based approach precise estimation of railway rail service life is of great significance for the efficient use of maintenance and replacement resources and the effective prevention of broken rails  here  an innovative model for railway rail service life estimation is proposed  a railway line is divided into adjacent segments of the same specific length  each segment is termed a  rail grid   employing the theory of markov stochastic processes and hazard models  the service life of each rail grid is estimated and the degradation law of each rail grid is customized  the proposed model is verified using five year rail inspection data for the longhai railway  our evaluation demonstrates that the estimated rail service life is very close to the real rail service life and meets railway management requirements  
 estimating the effect of mobility and food choice on obesity in a rural  northern environment the literature suggests that energy balance is shaped by where food is accessed  mobility behaviors  beliefs  preferences  socioeconomic characteristics  and attributes of the built environment  however  the relationship of these factors with energy balance has not been simultaneously considered on a regional scale  utilizing a social ecological framework  this study incorporated individual level and geospatial data to estimate a structural equation model  sem  to examine the complex association of these variables with being overweight or obese  results indicate that food choice  mobility  demographic characteristics  and normative beliefs are related to energy imbalance  further  accounting for the endogeneity of food access and mobility changes both the significance and magnitude of factors associated with obesity as compared to treating them as exogenous  
 estimating the mean waiting time in airports through cooperative disaster response operations airport use rises in response to the need to transport people and deliver aid following a disaster episode  however  owing to unexpected demand and the availability of multiple aircraft operators and organizations  the fluctuating waiting time in airports has become an operational bottleneck  this requires airports to carry out cooperative disaster response operations in the region to relieve congestion and reduce response time  this study develops a model to estimate the mean waiting time in airports through cooperative disaster response operations  using an open jackson network model  it presents a numerical example to understand the different operational schemes  the result shows that assignment by adjusting the transition probability to meet the airport s service rate is the optimal case through cooperative operations  the policy implication for airport operators is that airports must be prepared to handle a balanced role assignment during disaster responses   c  2017 elsevier ltd  all rights reserved  
 estimating the price elasticity of fuel demand with stated preferences derived from a situational approach an evidence based policy debate about future fuel demand requires reliable estimates for fuel price elasticities  such predictions are often based on revealed preference  rp  data  however  this procedure will only yield reliable results in the absence of severe structural discontinuities  in order to overcome this potential limitation we used a situational stated preference  sp  survey to estimate the response to hypothetical fuel price changes beyond the scope of previous observations  we elicit fuel price elasticities for price increases up to four euros per liter and find that the situational approach predicts the actual responses to previously observed fuel price changes very well  we conclude that applying a situational approach is particularly useful  if behavioral predictions for unprecedented  non monetary  policy interventions or supply side shocks are of interest that go beyond the reach of standard rp approaches   c  2017 the authors  published by elsevier ltd  
 estimating the safety benefit of separated cycling infrastructure adjusted for behavioral adaptation among drivers  an application of agent based modelling separated cycling infrastructure is a key strategy employed by urban and transport planners to reduce car vs cyclist crashes  we constructed an agent based model  abm  to explore the potential effects of introducing progressively greater levels of saturation  e g   more kms  of separated cycling infrastructure into a transport network in which drivers also demonstrated behavioral adaptation in response to increased exposure to cyclists as suggested by the safety in numbers  sin  theory  the findings highlight that if behavioral adaptation among drivers is assumed to be a strong mechanism underpinning cyclist safety  the introduction of low levels of separated cycling infrastructure across a network  e g   few kms  may provide little or no reduction in car vs cyclist crashes  this is due to the countervailing effects that separated infrastructure may have on drivers  exposure to cyclists  a fundamental contributor to the concept of behavioral adaptation  this study demonstrates the utility of abms to explicitly define and model candidate behavioral mechanisms associated with cyclist and vehicle interaction when estimating the interaction of infrastructure and behavioral mechanisms proposed to underlie cyclist safety  practically  it suggests that greater saturation of separated cycling infrastructure across transport networks may be required to reduce overall car vs cyclist crashes in circumstances where behavioral adaptation is also a strong mechanism contributing to cyclist safety   c  2017 elsevier ltd  all rights reserved  
 estimating the trip generation impacts of autonomous vehicles on car travel in victoria  australia autonomous vehicles  avs  potentially increase vehicle travel by reducing travel and parking costs and by providing improved mobility to those who are too young to drive or older people  the increase in vehicle travel could be generated by both trip diversion from other modes and entirely new trips  existing studies however tend to overlook avs  impacts on entirely new trips  there is a need to develop a methodology for estimating possible impacts of avs on entirely new trips across all age groups  this paper explores the impacts of avs on car trips using a case study of victoria  australia  a new methodology for estimating entirely new trips associated with avs is proposed by measuring gaps in travel need at different life stages  results show that avs would increase daily trips by 4 14  on average  the 76  age group would have the largest increase of 18 5   followed by the 18 24 age group and the 12 17 age group with 14 6 and 11 1  respectively  if car occupancy remains constant in av scenarios  entirely new trips and trip diversions from public transport and active modes would lead to a 7 31  increase in car trips  however increases in car travel are substantially magnified by reduced car occupancy rates  a trend evidenced throughout the world  car occupancy would need to increase by at least 5 3 7 3  to keep car trips unchanged in av scenarios  
 estimating the value of life and injury for pedestrians using a stated preference framework introduction  the incidence of pedestrian death over the period 2010 to 2014 per 1000 000 in north cyprus is about 2 5 times that of the eu  with 10 5 times more pedestrian road injuries than deaths  with the prospect of north cyprus entering the eu  many investments need to be undertaken to improve road safety in order to reach eu benchmarks  method  we conducted a stated choice experiment to identify the preferences and tradeoffs of pedestrians in north cyprus for improved walking times  pedestrian costs  and safety  the choice of route was examined using mixed logit models to obtain the marginal utilities associated with each attribute of the routes that consumers chose  these were used to estimate the individuals  willingness to pay  wtp  to save walking time and to avoid pedestrian fatalities and injuries  we then used the results to obtain community wide estimates of the value of a statistical life  vsl  saved  the value of an injury  vi  prevented  and the value per hour of walking time saved  results  the estimate of the vsl was 699 434 and the estimate of vi was 20 077  these values are consistent  after adjusting for differences in incomes  with the median results of similar studies done for eu countries  the estimated value of time to pedestrians is 720 per person hour  conclusions  the ratio of deaths to injuries is much higher for pedestrians than for road accidents  and this is completely consistent with the higher estimated wtp to avoid a pedestrian accident than to avoid a car accident the value of time of 7 20 is quite high relative to the wages earned  practical applications  findings provide a set of information on the vrr for fatalities and injuries and the value of pedestrian time that is critical for conducing ex ante appraisals of investments to improve pedestrian safety   c  2017 national safety council elsevier ltd  all rights reserved

 evaluating health outcomes from vehicle emissions exposure in the long range regional transportation planning process the air quality impacts of a metropolitan region s long range transportation plans are generally evaluated by estimating the change in a region s vehicle emission inventory  a change in the overall quantity of vehicle emissions in a region is generally associated with lower concentrations of vehicle related air pollutants and therefore a reduction in public health risks from exposure to vehicle emissions  a major limitation of this common approach is that aggregate emission inventories provide no information about localized impacts  while some areas experience air quality improvements  air quality can become worse in others  such aggregate analyses are ill suited for addressing contemporary transportation planning questions such as identifying vehicle emission exposure hotspots  quantifying health risks  and evaluating environmental justice concerns  in this paper we describe a computationally efficient analysis framework for evaluating a regional transportation plan with spatially detailed estimates of vehicle emission exposures and related health outcomes  we then apply our framework in a case study of fine particulate matter exposure in the atlanta  georgia metropolitan area and the changes expected to occur through the year 2040 under the region s long range transportation plan  we find that exposure and health risks decline from current levels by 2020 but then begin to slowly increase in some areas by 2040  we also find that low income and minority populations have the greatest health risks  confirming environmental justice concerns that have been noted in other regions  
 evaluating impacts of different longitudinal driver assistance systems on reducing multi vehicle rear end crashes during small scale inclement weather multi vehicle rear end  mvre  crashes during small scale inclement  ssi  weather cause high fatality rates on freeways  which cannot be solved by traditional speed limit strategies  this study aimed to reduce mvre crash risks during ssi weather using different longitudinal driver assistance systems  ldas   the impact factors on mvre crashes during ssi weather were firstly analyzed  then  four ldas  including forward collision warning  fcw   autonomous emergency braking  aeb   adaptive cruise control  acc  and cooperative acc  cacc   were modeled based on a unified platform  the intelligent driver model  idm   simulation experiments were designed and a large number of simulations were then conducted to evaluate safety effects of different ldas  results indicate that the fcw and acc system have poor performance on reducing wire crashes during ssi weather  the slight improvement of sight distance of fcw and the limitation of perception reaction time of acc lead the failure of avoiding mvre crashes in most scenarios  the aeb system has the better effect due to automatic perception and reaction  as well as performing the full brake when encountering ssi weather  the cacc system has the best performance because wireless communication provides a larger sight distance and a shorter time delay at the sub second level  sensitivity analyses also indicated that the larger number of vehicles and speed changes after encountering ssi weather have negative impacts on safety performances  results of this study provide useful information for accident prevention during ssi weather  
 evaluating lane reservation problems by carbon emission approach the lane reservation strategy is an efficient way for traffic control and management  design of reserved lanes on existing network is called lane reservation problem  this paper examines the lane reservation problem from a new perspective of carbon emission in real urban transportation network  which incorporates the environmental impact and the traffic state of a city into design of reserved lanes  a carbon emission index is constructed to measure the impact of the reservation strategy  an integer linear programming model is used to improve the efficiency of special transports with the objective of minimizing the carbon emission index  real urban traffic state is considered when the lane reservation strategy is implemented  the gird approximation method is developed to estimate the traffic state of a city using 30 day trajectory data of 14 000 vehicles in shenzhen  china  extensive computational analyses have been presented by several experiments based on real traffic data  the results indicate that lane reservation strategy can bring not only efficient transportation on reserved lanes  but also air pollution  the growth trend of the increased emissions becomes smooth after a sharp rise during the onset of the introduction of the reserved lane  with same improvement  fewer reserved lanes are required  but more emissions are produced under congested traffic than smooth traffic   c  2017 elsevier ltd  all rights reserved

 evaluating the environmental performance of the high speed rail project in the basque country  spain this paper analyses the contribution of the high speed rail project in the basque country  spain  to energy consumption reduction and to climate change mitigation by means of a simplified life cycle assessment  the calculation of co2 emissions and energy consumption reductions over the service lifetime of the infrastructure  60 years  shows that  even in the most optimistic scenarios considered  it would neither compensate the co2 emissions linked to its construction and maintenance  2 71 mtco 2    nor would it contribute to net energy savings before 55 years of service  robustness of these results leads us to conclude that ghg emissions reduction and energy savings should not be used as a general argument in favour of investing in high speed rail infrastructure   c  2017 elsevier ltd  all rights reserved  
 evaluating the impact of a workplace parking levy on local traffic congestion  the case of nottingham uk a workplace parking levy  wpl  scheme raises a levy on private non domestic off street parking provided by employers  in april 2012 nottingham became the first uk city to implement such a scheme with the revenue generated hypothecated for funding transport improvements  the lag between the introduction of the wpl and the opening of related public transport improvements represents an opportunity to study the impact of a wpl on congestion as a standalone measure  in order to achieve this it is necessary to consider changes to variables external to the wpl  which also impact on congestion  which may obscure any beneficial impact of the scheme  an autoregressive time series model which accounts for the impact of these exogenous variables is used to evaluate the impact of the introduction of the wpl on congestion  delay per vehicle mile is used as the dependent variable to represent congestion while the number of liable workplace parking places  lwpp  is used as a continuous intervention variable representing the introduction of the wpl  the model also contains a number of economic  transportation and climatic control variables  the results indicate that the introduction of the wpl as measured by the number of lwpp has a statistically significant impact on traffic congestion in nottingham  additionally  external explanatory variables are also shown to impact on congestion  suggesting that these may be masking the true impact of the scheme  this research represents the first statistical analysis of the link between the introduction of a wpl and a reduction in congestion  
 evaluating the impact of connectivity  continuity  and topography of sidewalk network on pedestrian safety with the increasing demand for sustainability  walking is being encouraged as one of the main active modes of transportation  however  pedestrians are vulnerable to severe injuries when involved in crashes which can discourage road users from walking  therefore  studying factors that affect the safety of pedestrians is important  this paper investigates the relationship between pedestrian motorist crashes and various sidewalk network indicators in the city of vancouver  the goal is to assess the impact of network connectivity  directness  and topography on pedestrian safety using macro level collision prediction models  the models were developed using generalized linear regression and full bayesian techniques  both walking trips and vehicle kilometers travelled were used as the main traffic exposure variables in the models  the safety models supported the safety in numbers hypothesis showing a non linear positive association between pedestrian motorist crashes and the increase in walking trips and vehicle traffic  the model results also suggested that higher continuity  linearity  coverage  and slope of sidewalk networks were associated with lower crash occurrence  however  network connectivity was associated with higher crash occurrence  the spatial effects were accounted for in the full bayes models and were found significant  the models provide insights about the factors that influence pedestrian safety and the spatial variability of pedestrian crashes within a city  which can be useful for the planning of pedestrian networks  
 evaluating the impacts of using cargo cycles on urban logistics  integrating traffic  environmental and operational boundaries introduction european commission has promoted actions and policies with the aim of reducing the negative impacts on traffic and environment caused by city logistics  one increasingly popular measure is the use of cargo bikes in city logistics due to their improved energy efficiency  lower emissions and lower traffic disturbance  the paper assess the impacts of electric cargo bikes  from a public policy perspective and  simultaneously  taking into account variables that cover the urban logistics operators  interests  under a public policy perspective  the considered variables evaluate mobility  environmental impacts and indirectly  the quality of life  in terms of private interests  the studied variables cover costs levels  operation and driving  and efficiency  this evaluation aims at clarifying if electric cargo bikes can indeed represent a sustainable mobility policy under specific boundaries  by leading to better environmental and social impacts and not hindering the operational efficiency of urban logistics activities  methods for that purpose  the measurement of the traffic key performance indicators  as well as of well to wheel energy and co2 emission savings is performed allowing to quantify mobility  reliability and operational efficiency indicators  several scenarios related with the introduction of electric cargo bikes replacing conventional vans were assessed and evaluated in order to compare the effects of different market shares in the mobility of the studied area located in porto  portugal   acknowledging the short distance range of cargo bikes  the simulation is carried out and an estimation of the total transportation cost is performed  which includes transport and emission cost when the vehicle is driving  emission cost while idling and labor cost  results the main conclusion is that cargo bikes can replace up to 10  of the conventional vans in areas with maximum linear distances of about 2 km  without changing the overall network efficiency  additionally  urban logistics wtw co2 emission impacts can be reduced by up to 73   which represents 746 kg of co2 avoided emissions  furthermore  the introduction of electric cargo bikes in urban logistics activities has positive effects for all the vehicle categories and all the scenarios  reaching up to 25  of reductions in external costs  conclusions as a result  cargo bikes implemented at the appropriate spatial scale within the city can be a sustainable solution for urban logistics  depending on a prior delimitation of the conditions and adequate implementation strategy  to guarantee that it actually leads to improvements in terms of mobility  environment  energy  running costs and externalities  
 evaluating the robustness effects of infrastructure projects based on their topological and geometrical roadway designs when infrastructures projects are evaluated  it is not only important to evaluate them with models that represent the average daily situation  but also to evaluate them in case of irregular situations like incidents  this becomes especially relevant when various project alternatives are expected to show significantly different scores in case of incidents  project alternatives and their road sections have different topological and geometrical characteristics  the focus of this paper is on the following characteristics  hard shoulders  the number of lanes  parallel road structures and weaving sections  the main question that this paper addresses is how these network characteristics affect both the risk of different types of incidents occurring and the effects of those incidents on the network performance  robustness   in order to answer this question  analytical examples are presented for small theoretical networks that give insight into how the selected characteristics affect the total delay caused by incidents and its dependence on the traffic volume  capacity  severity and duration of incidents  a marginal simulation based method is presented that can be used to compute the robustness effects of project alternatives  given their geometrical and topological characteristics  on a network level  a case study for an infrastructure project in the netherlands is presented that illustrates how the robustness effects of infrastructure projects can be computed given their topological and geometrical characteristics  
 evaluating the roles and powers of rail regulatory bodies in europe  a survey based approach european railways have been shaped by multiple reforms since the mid 1990s  covering industry structure  market opening and economic regulation  however  the literature has given little attention to the latter  namely the evolution and impacts of regulatory reforms amongst europe s railways  this paper fills this gap by providing an up to date  bottom up assessment of current rail regulatory practice in europe  we develop a survey of economic regulators across europe  thus complementing top down studies of the impact of economic regulation by enabling a richer insight into regulatory activity and its impacts  the questionnaire is based on a review of the literature on ideal regulatory characteristics across multiple industries  our results show that european rail regulators  in general  exhibit many of the features of ideal regulation  in particular around key features such as independence  resourcing  longevity and expertise  transparency and in turn stability and predictability  however  we find that rail regulatory bodies could take a more proactive role in shaping track access charges  given their importance in respect of efficient use of the network and maintaining non discriminatory access  importantly  there is also scope for regulators to play a greater role in regulating the efficiency and quality of infrastructure managers  and potentially becoming more involved in the designing stages of passenger market opening as it emerges  and these changes could deliver substantial beneficial impacts for rail users and funders across europe  
 evaluating the safety impact of adaptive cruise control in traffic oscillations on freeways adaptive cruise control  acc  has been considered one of the critical components of automated driving  acc adjusts vehicle speeds automatically by measuring the status of the ego vehicle and leading vehicle  current commercial accs are designed to be comfortable and convenient driving systems  little attention is paid to the safety impacts of acc  especially in traffic oscillations when crash risks are the highest  the primary objective of this study was to evaluate the impacts of acc parameter settings on rear end collisions on freeways  first  the occurrence of a rear end collision in a stop and go wave was analyzed  a car following model in an integrated acc was developed for a simulation analysis  the time to collision based factors were calculated as surrogate safety measures of the collision risk  we also evaluated different market penetration rates considering that the application of acc will be a gradual process  the results showed that the safety impacts of acc were largely affected by the parameters  smaller time delays and larger time gaps improved safety performance  but inappropriate parameter settings increased the collision risks and caused traffic disturbances  a higher reduction of the collision risk was achieved as the acc vehicle penetration rate increased  especially in the initial stage with penetration rates of less than 30   this study also showed that in the initial stage  the combination of acc and a variable speed limit achieved better safety improvements on congested freeways than each single technique  
 evaluating the safety in numbers effect for pedestrians at urban intersections assessment of collision risk between pedestrians and automobiles offers a powerful and informative tool in urban planning applications  and can be leveraged to inform proper placement of improvements and treatment projects to improve pedestrian safety  such assessment can be performed using existing datasets of crashes  pedestrian counts  and automobile traffic flows to identify intersections or corridors characterized by elevated collision risks to pedestrians  the safety in numbers phenomenon  which refers to the observable effect that pedestrian safety is positively correlated with increased pedestrian traffic in a given area  i e  that the individual per pedestrian risk of a collision decreases with additional pedestrians   is a readily observed phenomenon that has been studied previously  though its directional causality is not yet known  a sample of 488 intersections in minneapolis were analyzed  and statistically significant log linear relationships between pedestrian traffic flows and the per pedestrian crash risk were found  indicating the safety in numbers effect  potential planning applications of this analysis framework towards improving pedestrian safety in urban environments are discussed  
 evaluating the stability of a freestanding mast climbing work platform mast climbing work platforms  mcwps  are becoming more common at construction sites and are being used as an alternative to traditional scaffolding  although their use is increasing  little to no published information exists on the potential safety hazards they could pose for workers  as a last line of defense  a personal fall arrest system can be used to save a worker in a fall incident from the platform  there has been no published information on whether it is safe to use such a personal fall arrest system with mcwps  in this study  the issues of concern for occupational safety included   a  the overall stability of the freestanding mast climber during a fall arrest condition and  b  whether that fall arrest system could potentially present safety hazards to other workers on the platform during a fall arrest condition  this research project investigated those safety concerns with respect to the mast climber stability and the workers using it by creating fall arrest impact forces that are transmitted to the equipment and by subsequently observing the movement of the mast climber and the working deck used by the workers  this study found that when the equipment was erected and used according to the manufacturer s recommendations during a fall arrest condition  destabilizing forces were very small and there were no signs of potential of mcwp collapse  however  potential fall hazards could be presented to other workers on the platform during a fall arrest  workers near an open platform are advised to wear a personal fall arrest system to reduce the risk of being ejected  due to the increasing use of mcwps at construction sites  there is a corresponding need for evidence and science based safety guidelines or regulations and further research should be conducted to continue to fill the knowledge gap with mcwp equipment  published by elsevier ltd  
 evaluating the usefulness of the structural accessibility layer for planning practice   planning practitioners  perception there has been a growing attention on accessibility concepts from both planning practice and research recognising their relevance in understanding the evolution of urban areas  however  despite the large number of accessibility measures available in the literature  they are not widely used to support urban planning practices  much has been said about the implementation gap of planning support systems with a significant attention paid to usability and more recently to the usefulness of accessibility instruments  the paper aims to assess the usefulness of a specific accessibility instrument the structural accessibility layer  sal  and by doing so exploring the strengths of accessibility instruments holding similar characteristics  to this end  we follow a multidimensional assessment framework under development in the planning support system literature  this paper explores the main findings of a workshop bringing together local planning practitioners and the developers of the sal in an experiment using the sal  the assessment of usefulness of sal identified the instrument s strengths with regard to insight into participants  assumptions  communication  commitment and development of shared language  regardless  the low fit between planning concerns of participants  in this case study context  and of the sal seemed to limit its potential use in practice and as such undermines the strengths identified in the usefulness assessment  the assessment developed here only partially confirmed objectives and purposes defined for the sal  results confirm the usefulness of the sal as diagnosis tool  however  the ability of the sal to contribute to a joint thinking of land use and transport constraints on mobility was not confirmed  finally  this research raises questions on the role of pss in changing strategic thinking in planning and how this might conflict with the current pss research concern in improving usefulness of tools   c  2017 elsevier ltd  all rights reserved  
 evaluation of countermeasures for red light running by traffic simulator based surrogate safety measures objective  the conflicts among motorists entering a signalized intersection with the red light indication have become a national safety issue  because of its sensitivity  efforts have been made to investigate the possible causes and effectiveness of countermeasures using comparison sites and or before and after studies  nevertheless  these approaches are ineffective when comparison sites cannot be found  or crash data sets are not readily available or not reliable for statistical analysis  considering the random nature of red light running  rlr  crashes  an inventive approach regardless of data availability is necessary to evaluate the effectiveness of each countermeasure face to face method  the aims of this research are to  1  review erstwhile literature related to red light running and traffic safety models   2  propose a practical methodology for evaluation of rlr countermeasures with a microscopic traffic simulation model and surrogate safety assessment model  ssam    3  apply the proposed methodology to actual signalized intersection in virginia  with the most prevalent scenariosincreasing the yellow signal interval duration  installing an advance warning sign  and an rlr camera  and  4  analyze the relative effectiveness by rlr frequency and the number of conflicts  rear end and crossing  results  all scenarios show a reduction in rlr frequency   7 8   45 5  and  52 4   respectively   but only increasing the yellow signal interval duration results in a reduced total number of conflicts   11 3   a surrogate safety measure of possible rlr related crashes   an rlr camera makes the greatest reduction   60 9   in crossing conflicts  a surrogate safety measure of possible angle crashes   whereas increasing the yellow signal interval duration results in only a 12 8  reduction of rear end conflicts  a surrogate safety measure of possible rear end crash  conclusions  although increasing the yellow signal interval duration is advantageous because this reduces the total conflicts  a possibility of total rlr related crashes   each countermeasure shows different effects by rlr related conflict types that can be referred to when making a decision  given that each intersection has different rlr crash issues  evaluated countermeasures are directly applicable to enhance the cost and time effectiveness  according to the situation of the target intersection  in addition  the proposed methodology is replicable at any site that has a dearth of crash data and or comparison sites in order to test any other countermeasures  both engineering and enforcement countermeasures  for rlr crashes

 ex ante impact evaluation of corporate average fuel economy standards on energy consumption and the environment in south korea to address the global concerns about climate change  south korea adopted the corporate average fuel economy  cafe  standards to reduce energy consumption and co2 emissions in the transport sector  however  the effectiveness of cafe standards in south korea remains controversial because no significant reductions in energy consumption and co2 emissions have been reported since these standards were introduced  this study aims to analyze the effectiveness of cafe standards in south korea  by developing a two stage model to describe the automobile purchase and usage behavior of consumers sequentially  this study also simulates the effectiveness of cafe standards in south korea under short and long term scenarios  according to the results  when automobile manufacturers reduce the relative prices of economy and subcompact automobiles by 20  in the short term  the total fuel consumption and co2 emissions will decrease by 0 381  and 0 408   respectively  compared with the conditions in 2012  in the long term  when manufacturers improve the fuel efficiency of diesel and gasoline automobiles by 20   the corresponding reductions will be by approximately 2 83  for each  in addition  this study verifies that the rebound effect is a crucial aspect when evaluating energy demand management policy  failing to consider such an effect could lead to overestimating the amount of energy conservation  such ex ante analysis provides significant implications for policymakers to enhance policy effectiveness in this domain   c  2017 elsevier ltd  all rights reserved  
 exact and approximate route set generation for resilient partial observability in sensor location problems sensor positioning is a fundamental problem in transportation networks  as the location of sensors strongly determines how traffic flows are observable and hence manageable  this paper aims to develop a methodology to determine sensor locations on a network such that an optimal trade off solution is found between the amount of sensors installed and the resilience of the sensor set  in particular  we propose exact and heuristic solutions for identifying the optimal route sets such that no other route would include any additional information for finding optimal full and partial observability solutions  this is an important contribution to sensor location problems  as route based link flow inference problems have non unique solutions  strongly depending on the used link route information  the properties of the new methodology are analyzed and illustrated through different case studies  and the advantages of the algorithms are quantified both for full and for partial observability solutions  due to the route sets found by our approach  we are able to find full observability solutions characterized by a small number of sensors  while yet being efficient also in terms of partial observability  we perform validation tests on both small and real life sized network instances   c  2017 elsevier ltd  all rights reserved  
 exact and heuristic algorithms for rapid and station arrival time guaranteed bus transportation via lane reservation this paper addresses a new lane reservation problem called bus lane reservation problem  blrp   the focus of the problem is on optimally selecting lanes to be reserved from an existing transport network and designing reserved lane based bus paths  such that the rapid and station arrival time guaranteed bus transit can be ensured  thereby achieving rapid and reliable bus transportation  however  once lanes are reserved  negative impact  such as an increase in travel time on adjacent non reserved lanes may be caused  for this problem  an improved integer linear program is first formulated to minimize such negative impact  as the existing commercial solvers  e g   cplex  can only solve small size problems  we develop an exact enhanced cut and solve algorithm and an improved kernel search heuristic for solving medium  and large size problems  results of extensive numerical experiments confirm the effectiveness and efficiency of the proposed algorithms  in addition  a bi objective robust brlp is investigated to study the tradeoff between the negative impact of reserved lanes and the robustness of solution against the uncertainties in the link travel time and the bus dwell time  
 examination of adult and child bicyclist safety relevant events using naturalistic bicycling methodology among roadway users  bicyclists are considered vulnerable due to their high risk for injury when involved in a crash  little is known about the circumstances leading to near crashes  crashes  and related injuries or how these vary by age and gender  the purpose of this study was to examine the rates and characteristics of safety relevant events  crashes  near crashes  errors  and traffic violations  among adult and child bicyclists  bicyclist trips were captured using pedal portal  a data acquisition and coding system which includes a gps enabled video camera and graphical user interface  a total of 179 safety relevant events were manually coded from trip videos  overall  child errors and traffic violations occurred at a rate of 1 9 per 100 min of riding  compared to 6 3 for adults  however  children rode on the sidewalk 56 4  of the time  compared with 12 7  for adults  for both adults and children  the highest safety relevant event rates occurred on paved roadways with no bicycle facilities present  adults   8 6 and children   7 2  per 100 min of riding   our study  the first naturalistic study to compare safety  relevant events among adults and children  indicates large variation in riding behavior and exposure between child and adult bicyclists  the majority of identified events were traffic violations and we were not able to code all risk relevant data  e g   subtle avoidance behaviors  failure to check for traffic  probability of collision   future naturalistic cycling studies would benefit from enhanced instrumentation  e g   additional camera views  and coding protocols able to fill these gaps   c  2017 elsevier ltd  all rights reserved  
 examination of the reliability of the crash modification factors using empirical bayes method with resampling technique there have been plenty of studies intended to use different methods  for example  empirical bayes before after methods  to get accurate estimation of cmfs  all of them have different assumptions toward crash count if there was no treatment  additionally  another major assumption is that multiple sites share the same true cmf  under this assumption  the cmf at an individual intersection is randomly drawn from a normally distributed population of cmfs at all intersections  since cmfs are non zero values  the population of all cmfs might not follow normal distributions  and even if it does  the true mean of cmfs at some intersections may be different from that at others  therefore  a bootstrap method based on before after empirical bayes theory was proposed to estimate cmfs  but it did not make distributional assumptions  this bootstrap procedure has the added benefit of producing a measure of cmf stability  furthermore  based on the bootstrapped cmf  a new cmf precision rating method was proposed to evaluate the reliability of cmfs  this study chose 29 urban four legged intersections as treated sites  and their controls were changed from stop controlled to signal controlled  meanwhile  124 urban four legged stop controlled intersections were selected as reference sites  at first  different safety performance functions  spfs  were applied to five crash categories  and it was found that each crash category had different optimal spf form  then  the cmfs of these five crash categories were estimated using the bootstrap empirical bayes method  the results of the bootstrapped method showed that signalization significantly decreased angle   left turn crashes  and its cmf had the highest precision  while  the cmf for rear end crashes was unreliable  for kabco  kabc  and kab crashes  their cmfs were proved to be reliable for the majority of intersections  but the estimated effect of signalization may be not accurate at some sites  
 examining associations between urban design attributes and transport mode choice for walking  cycling  public transport and private motor vehicle trips objective  many research papers examine the relationship of the built environment on transport behaviour using only one mode of transport  yet to inform policy makers  a broader examination of transport mode choice across different transport modes is required  here  associations between urban design attributes and transport mode choices including transport walking  transport cycling  public transport and private motor vehicle use were explored  methods  secondary analysis was conducted on 16 890 participants aged 18 years or older who participated in the victorian integrated survey of travel activity 2009 2010  vista09  in metropolitan melbourne  australia  adjusted multilevel logistic regression models were used to explore the relationship between urban design attributes and transport walking  cycling  public transport and private motor vehicle use  results  taking transport walking  cycling or public transport trips was positively associated with the housing diversity score and gross dwelling density  taking private motor vehicle trips was negatively associated with street connectivity  land use mix  local living score  housing diversity score  gross dwelling density and proximity to supermarkets  conclusion  the study found that environments that neighbourhoods with gross residential densities exceeding 20 dwellings per hectare  a well connected street network  access to 9 or more local living destinations and short distances to public transport services  i e   400 m for bus and 5 800 m for train  encourage walking  cycling and public transport use  while discouraging driving  comprehensive integrated urban planning of transport infrastructure  land use development and service provision is required to create neighbourhoods that support active and sustainable living that allow for a flexible mix of land uses and transport options  
 examining how different measurement approaches impact safety outcomes in child pedestrian research  implications for research and prevention there has been a great deal of research aimed at understanding the causes of child pedestrian injury  many different methods have been employed with the goal of designing simulations that produce rigorous assessment of children s behaviors without putting children at risk of actual pedestrian injury  most research has assessed children s pre crossing decision making and extrapolated crossing outcome measures from estimates of mean walking speed  this study explores the nature and extent of measurement bias that is introduced when average walking speed is used to produce estimates of outcomes versus measuring actual in road behavior directly  using a within subjects design and a fully immersive virtual reality pedestrian simulator  both measures were taken  comparisons based on regression models revealed the extent of differences in results produced by measurement bias  results indicated that measurement bias is produced when average walking speed is used such that hits and high risk crossings are overestimated and missed opportunities are underestimated  resulting in an overall overestimate of children s risk for pedestrian injury  the discussion highlights how these two measurement approaches emphasize different underlying processes as determinants of child pedestrian injury risk  
 examining pedestrian evasive actions as a potential indicator for traffic conflicts the use of traffic conflicts is gaining acceptance as a proactive approach to studying road safety  a traffic conflict involves a chain of events in which at least one of the involved road users performs some sort of evasive actions to avoid a potential collision  pedestrian evasive actions are normally manifested by changes in the walking behaviour which is expressed through variations in their speed profile  this paper investigates the automatic detection of pedestrian evasive actions in a computer vision framework  the study proposes a new measure for detecting pedestrians undertaking evasive actions based on permutation entropy  pe   pe is a robust approach for discovering dynamic characteristics of a time series  in the current context  it reveals the degree of abnormality in the walking pattern by identifying the deviations from the normal free walking  the methodology is applied and validated using video data from an intersection in shanghai  china  results show that the pe based indicator has a high potential to identify and measure the severity of conflicts that involve pedestrian evasive actions compared to traditional time proximity measures  e g  time to collision and post encroachment time   this research finds many applications in the modern transportation infrastructure monitoring  studying pedestrian crossing behaviour and developing safety programs for vulnerable road users  
 examining the effects of the built environment and residential self selection on commuting trips and the related co2 emissions  an empirical study in guangzhou  china numerous studies have established the link between the built environment and travel behavior  however  fewer studies have focused on environmental costs of travel  such as co2 emissions  with respect to residential self selection  combined with the application of tiqs  travel intelligent query system   this study develops a structural equations model  sem  to examine the effects of the built environment and residential self selection on commuting trips and their related co2 emissions using data from 2015 in guangzhou  china  the results demonstrate that the effect of residential self selection also exists in chinese cities  influencing residents  choice of living environments and ultimately affecting their commute trip co2 emissions  after controlling for the effect of residential self selection  built environment variables still have significant effects on co2 emissions from commuting although some are indirect effects that work through mediating variables  car ownership and commuting trip distance   specifically  co2 emissions are negatively affected by land use mix  residential density  metro station density and road network density  conversely  bus stop density  distance to city centers and parking availability near the workplace have positive effects on co2 emissions  to promote low carbon travel  intervention on the built environment would be effective and necessary   c  2017 elsevier ltd  all rights reserved  
 examining the influence of link function misspecification in conventional regression models for developing crash modification factors this study further examined the use of regression models for developing crash modification factors  cmfs   specifically focusing on the misspecification in the link function  the primary objectives were to validate the accuracy of cmfs derived from the commonly used regression models  i e   generalized linear models or glms with additive linear link functions  when some of the variables have nonlinear relationships and quantify the amount of bias as a function of the nonlinearity  using the concept of artificial realistic data  various linear and nonlinear crash modification functions  cm functions  were assumed for three variables  crash counts were randomly generated based on these cm functions  cmfs were then derived from regression models for three different scenarios  the results were compared with the assumed true values  the main findings are summarized as follows   1  when some variables have nonlinear relationships with crash risk  the cmfs for these variables derived from the commonly used glms are all biased  especially around areas away from the baseline conditions  e g   boundary areas    2  with the increase in nonlinearity  i e   nonlinear relationship becomes stronger   the bias becomes more significant   3  the quality of cmfs for other variables having linear relationships can be influenced when mixed with those having nonlinear relationships  but the accuracy may still be acceptable  and  4  the misuse of the link function for one or more variables can also lead to biased estimates for other parameters  this study raised the importance of the link function when using regression models for developing cmfs   c  2017 elsevier ltd  all rights reserved  
 examining the relationships between individual s time use and activity participations with their health indicators purpose using a three week household activity travel survey  this paper explores the relationship between individuals  self reported physical  mental and social health conditions and their time allocation for different types of in home and out of home time activities  methods a path model is developed to investigate the roles of activity travel time use on the self reported health conditions  while the socio demographics and residential environment characteristics are also considered  results the model results reveal heterogeneous impacts of different types of activities and intensities on individual s self reported health conditions  this study  however  did not find evidence of positive relationship between cycling and walking and self reported physical health condition  which has been found in many developed countries  presumably this is because in developing countries like indonesia the individuals who walk and cycle are likely to be a part of economically disadvantaged groups who have less awareness to their own health conditions  conclusion beside activity and travel time use factors  age and working status were found significantly affecting the self reported health conditions  regardless of respondents  gender and income  neighbourhood characteristics  such as population density  are also found positively correlated to self reported respondents  physical  social and mental health conditions  
 examining usage patterns of a bike sharing scheme in a medium sized city bike sharing is one of the fastest growing new modes of transport in the world  with more and more schemes opening every year  this paper examines the trends in a bike sharing scheme that has been in operation in cork since 2014  while many studies exist on how bike sharing schemes are changing mobility in cities across the globe  few studies have looked at the dynamics of these schemes in smaller cities  one of the motivations in looking at a small city like cork is to determine if smaller cites derive benefits from bike sharing schemes and can bike sharing schemes provide a prominent role in these cities  this research found that in a small  compact city like cork  average trip times recorded are short with regular uses displaying habitual trip patterns  this includes using the same bike stations and following similar routes on a daily or weekly basis  the findings also suggest weather has an impact upon usage  with longer trips more likely during better weather conditions  the findings of the paper provide insights to the dynamics of usage of a smaller bike sharing scheme and results on how bike sharing is offering citizens a new transport alternative   c  2017 elsevier ltd  all rights reserved  
 exhaust emissions of biodiesel binary and multi blends from cotton  jatropha and neem oil from stationary multi cylinder ci engine biodiesel considerably decrease the co and co2 emissions and its blends reduce nox emissions  in this work  binary blends of biodiesel from cotton  jatropha and neem with diesel were prepared in form of b5c  b10c  b15c  b20c  b25c and b30c for cotton at 5   10   15   20   25  and 30  respectively  this was similarly done for jatropha and neem biodiesel designated as b5j and mon  etc  a set of multi blends of all the 3biodiesel with diesel were also prepared  the fuel samples were used to run a cusson s 4 cylinder  stationary diesel engine with data logger system  the exhaust emissions of fuel during the combustion process were measured using imr 1400 gas analyser to detect the composition of flue gases at 1500 rpm  2000 rpm  and 2500 rpm engine speeds  it was found that  b2oc has the lowest exhaust temperature  lowest percentage losses  highest combustion efficiency  and lowest nox and co2 emissions  but highest so2 emissions although with negligible percentage  the binary biodiesel blends are better than the multi blends in terms of exhaust emissions reduction   c  2017 elsevier ltd  all rights reserved  
 exogenous priority rules for the capacitated passenger assignment problem we propose a novel algorithm for the capacitated passenger assignment problem in public transportation where exogenous priority lists define the order in which passengers are assigned  separating explicitly theses rules from the assignment procedure allows for a great deal of flexibility to model various priority rules  when the actual rules are endogenous  the framework can easily be embedded in a fixed point specification  computational experiments are performed on a realistic case study based on the morning rush hours of the timetable of canton vaud  switzerland  the algorithm is able to assign the demand in very low computational times  the results provide evidences that the ordering of the passengers does not have a significant impact on aggregate performance indicators  such as average delay and level of unsatisfied demand   but that the variability at the individual passenger level is substantial  thanks to its flexibility  our framework can easily be implemented by a railway operator who wishes to evaluate the effects of different policies in terms of passenger priorities   c  2017 elsevier ltd  all rights reserved  
 experience sampling in and around airports  momentary subjective wellbeing  airports  and aviation noise in england we explore the wellbeing of people in and around english airports using real time data from a large spatial positioning experience sampling dataset  mappiness   we analyze the association between subjective wellbeing reported in the moment and aviation  in terms of airport location  aircraft noise  and activities within airports  this is the first time that a large experience sample method  esm  of momentary wellbeing measurements has been used to quantify the associations between aviation and subjective wellbeing  being within areas of high levels of aircraft noise is associated with lower levels of happiness and relaxation  those surveyed in proximity to airports report significantly lower levels of relaxation  these findings have important implications to policy  exploiting the panel nature of the esm data provides the strongest causal claims to date of the negative association between aviation activities and subjective wellbeing  the mappiness application also allows us to assess the association between airports and wellbeing on those inside them  and divide activities within airports between those who work there and those who are passing through for travel purposes  as well as the effects of aircraft noise beyond airports  this gives us a broader insight into the range of impacts  both positive and negative  that aviation has on peoples  momentary wellbeing  which may be used to inform aviation noise mitigation and compensation policies in the future  
 experiences of past school travel modes by university students and their intention of future car purchase we studied the relationship between experiences of past school travel mode choice by university students and their intention to purchase a car in future by using the life oriented approach  we conducted a retrospective questionnaire survey whose respondents were university students of two universities located in the center of the tokyo metropolitan area  tma   two in the suburbs of the tma  and three in major local cities outside of it  we asked them to consider their experience of past travel mode for going to upper level elementary  middle  and high school as well as general purpose travels from their mobility biography  we also asked about possible factors affecting their future intentions  such as their degree of concern about the environmental damage that car use might entail and their daily use of information and communication technology  ict  tools  responses from 351 university students were successfully collected  we found that experience of past bicycle use for going to high school affected the intention of future car purchase positively  while rail use for attending high school showed a statistically significant negative correlation  we also modeled the degree of young university students  intention to purchase a car in future by estimating ordered probit model  as a result  we found that experiences of past school travel by bicycle as high school students showed a positive relation  and of general purpose travel by rail showed negative relation to intentions of purchasing a car in future  the latter implies that the policy measures for promoting a less car dependent lifestyle by locating schools in the areas that are easily accessible by rail and conducting mobility management programs for molding school students  experiences of rail travel   c  2017 elsevier ltd  all rights reserved  
 experiences with transportation models  an international survey of planning practices transport planning practice is experiencing rapid transitions  this shifting professional environment is prompting lively and sometimes bitter debates about how transportation models should be used  while these models and their outputs play an increasingly more important function in transport related decision making processes  growing concerns emerge about their limitations  assumptions  biases  and usability  this paper addresses the question of how different professionals involved in transportation planning perceive and experience these tensions  for that purpose  we developed an online survey which was completed by 229 european transport planning practitioners  primarily working in the netherlands  denmark and germany  our findings support the following key conclusions  first  and contrary to popular notions on the matter  practitioners are relatively satisfied with the models they use  second  most respondents are confident that they understand the assumptions and uncertainties associated with transport models  but that other important stakeholders do not  however  third  the larger the distance that respondents have to hands on working experience with transportation models  the lower is their trust on model outputs  respondents who are not directly involved in the operation of the models a  report more negative experiences associated with model use in decision making processes and b  identify more usability barriers  the overall picture revealed a lack of trust amongst transport planning professionals  which is a problem needing to be addressed  we propose bringing models closer to those who use their outputs as a constructive solution to this trust deficit  
 experiential exposure to texting and walking in virtual reality  a randomized trial to reduce distracted pedestrian behavior background  distracted pedestrian behavior is a significant public health concern  as research suggests distracted pedestrians have significantly higher risk of injury compared to fully attentive pedestrians  despite this  efforts to reduce distracted pedestrian behavior are scant  objective  using a repeated measures experimental research design  we implemented a behavioral intervention to reduce distracted pedestrian behavior in the high risk environment of an urban college campus and simultaneously monitored behavior on a control urban college campus not exposed to the intervention  we had two primary aims  reduce perceived vulnerability to injury among individual pedestrians and reduce distracted pedestrian behavior in the environment through a change in community based norms  methods  the hallmark of the behavioral intervention was a week long opportunity for community members to experience personally the risks of distracted pedestrian behavior by attempting to cross a virtual pedestrian environment street while text messaging  this was supplemented by traditional and social marketing and publicity through various campus partners  a sample of 219 individuals completed self report surveys about perceived vulnerability to distracted pedestrian injury before experiencing the distracted virtual street crossing and again after 2 weeks and 5 months  observational assessment of distracted pedestrian behavior was conducted at a busy intersection on the campus as well as at a control campus not exposed to the intervention at baseline  post intervention  10 weeks  and 6 months  results  the intervention achieved mixed results  individuals exposed to texting within a simulated pedestrian environment reported changes in their intentions to cross streets while distracted and in perceived vulnerability to risk while crossing streets  but we did not witness evidence of changed community norms based on observed rates of distracted pedestrian behavior before and after the intervention compared to a control campus not exposed to the intervention  discussion  the intervention created some change in self reported intentions and thoughts but did not create significant behavior change on the campus exposed to it  further efforts to develop interventions that will yield a reduction in distracted pedestrian behavior are needed   c  2017 elsevier ltd  all rights reserved  
 experimental study on di diesel engine with acetylene in dual fuel mode with dee as an ignition enhancer fossils fuels are currently the dominant global source for air pollution and their combustion is posing a serious threat to clean environment  the economic cost of the effect of this pollution has been estimated at 0 4  of gdp for a developing country  the limits for reduction in the emissions levels have been agreed by various nations in concordance with the kyoto protocol  as far as low emission fuels are concerned  gaseous fuels appear to be capable of performing a prominent role in reducing emissions  various gaseous fuels such as biogas  producer gas  hydrogen  acetylene  lpg and cng are suitable for ic engines  in the present research  a genuine effort is made to establish that acetylene can be taken as a substitute fuel for diesel in dual fuel mode  a 4 4 kw single cylinder  air cooled diesel engine has been taken up for the present study  as the gaseous fuel suffers poor combustion in diesel engines  especially at part loads  dee which is considered as a most renewable fuel was injected into the port as a combustion enhancer at the rate of 100 g h  150 g h and 200 g h adopting carburetion technique at the maximum gas flow rate of 390 g h of acetylene gas  finally  the experiment yielded the maximum diesel energy substitution of 49  along with dee  in this study  the performance  combustion and emission characteristics of acetylene dee have been analysed   c  2017 elsevier ltd  all rights reserved  
 expert knowledge elicitation to generate human factors guidance for future european rail traffic management system  ertms  train driving models the european rail traffic management system  ertms  will have an impact on the train driving task and the behaviour of the train drivers  this paper presents a part of the final study of the series of studies that have been conducted as part of a three year research project  which investigated the effects of ertms on the behaviour of the train drivers  in recent times  a number of models of train driving have been developed in order to inform the design of the train driving technology and understand the implications of the design of the train driving task on the performance of the drivers and their behaviour  an expert knowledge elicitation study was conducted to evaluate the existing train driving models and to generate a guidance on human factors for the future ertms train driving models  the study consisted of a workshop  which was conducted using the rail human factor experts who have been directly involved with the projects examining ertms  the current train driving models were evaluated and ideas were generated as to how these should be shaped in the future to include systems such as ertms  the findings of the study contributed to bridging the gap between the theoretical understanding of the cognitive strategies of the train drivers and the practical implementation of novel technologies by the rail industry  
 exploiting crowdsourced geographic information and gis for assessment of air pollution exposure during active travel improvement on assessment of air pollution exposure will enhance assessment of health risk benefit when active travel  cycling and walking   earlier studies assessed air pollution exposure according to travel time and city level air pollution  the lack of spatially fine grained travel data is a barrier to an accurate assessment of air pollution exposure  due to a high level spatial granularity  strava metro provides an opportunity to assessing air pollution exposure in combination with spatially varying air pollution concentrations  strava metro anonymized and aggregated a large volume of users  traces to streets for each city  in this study  to explore the potential of crowdsourced geographic information in research of active travel and health  we used strava metro data and gis technologies to assess air pollution exposure in glasgow  uk  particularly  we incorporated time of the trip to assess average inhaled dose of pollutant during a single cycling or pedestrian trip  empirical results demonstrate that strava metro data provides an opportunity to an assessment of average air pollution exposure during active travel  additionally  to demonstrate the potential of strava metro data in policy making  we explored the spatial association of air pollution concentration and active travel  as a result  we identified areas that require investment priority  and fmally offered implications for policies  
 exploring built environment correlates of walking distance of transit egress in the twin cities most studies on walking distance to transit stops either emphasize transit access or do not distinguish transit access and egress  furthermore  environmental correlates of walking distance may differ by stop location  using the 2010 transit onboard survey in the minneapolis and st  paul metropolitan area  this study develops four models to compare the effects of the built environment around transit stops on walking distance of transit egress  job density is negatively correlated with walking distance  consistent in all four models  other built environment variables exhibit different impacts by stop location  particularly  land use mix has positive impacts on walking distance for stops outside of downtown and suburban employment centers whereas job density is more important for suburban centers  job accessibility and the number of intersections have significant effects on stops within downtown areas but have no significant impacts on stops outside of downtown areas  the number of transit stops has opposite impacts on walking distance for stops within and outside of downtown  moreover  the built environment tends to have a larger impact on walking distance in downtown areas than non downtown areas  we then discuss the implications for stop area land use planning and transit stop location choice  
 exploring car ownership and car use in neighborhoods near metro stations in beijing  does the neighborhood built environment matter  public transport services are believed to play an important role in constraining car use  however  it has been found that cars are still used at high rates near many metro stations  this paper aims to explore car ownership and car use in people living close to metro stations  taking beijing  china  as a case study  this study shows that the likelihood of owning a car  and the number of work and non work vehicle kilometers traveled  vkt   is lower in areas with higher mixed land use  residents  income and family structure both affect vkt  people with an awareness of sustainable land use and transportation modes use fewer vkt  the study also has some interesting new findings in the chinese context  it found that residential density was not significantly related to vkt  interestingly  neighborhood type was firmly associated with car ownership and use  those who live in danwei neighborhoods generated more work vkt  and those living in indemnificatory neighborhoods used more non work vkt  additionally  renters were less likely to own cars than house owners  and people with beijing hukou generated more vkt  people preferring to live in close proximity to the metro system and travel by foot were more likely to own cars in the future than other people  the results suggest that increasing land use diversity and the accessibility of living amenities in neighborhoods near metro stations could enhance the performance of transport systems by reducing dependence on cars  housing and transport policies  along with behavior education programs  could strengthen this effect  
 exploring stability and change in transport systems  combining delphi and system dynamics approaches transport is a vast and complex socio technical system  and despite a clear need to reduce dependence on fossil fuels due to undesirable environmental impacts  it is largely locked into business as usual  systems approaches are a useful way to help make sense of multiple competing influences which may be simultaneously driving change and supporting the status quo  this paper applies qualitative system dynamics modelling to help interpret the results of a delphi study into global transport transitions  involving 22 international experts in various aspects of transport  the main contribution of the paper is its exploration of the use of system dynamics  sd  modelling to interpret the delphi findings  sd modelling was used to reveal and elucidate the causal arguments put forward by the expert panel about the factors driving business as usual  the factors creating barriers to more sustainable transport systems  and the drivers of change  the sd model is used to explore and expose the key causal patterns at play  and how these interact to both support and hinder change  the resulting model shows the complex  interdependent dynamics involved in supporting the status quo  even at the relatively high level of analysis reported here  the model is useful in revealing interdependencies between parts of the system  where change in one part may well have knock on effects elsewhere in the system  in particular the model reveals the strong reinforcing loops that act to minimise the impact of change drivers and thus retain the dominance of automobility  the result is a system that is highly dependent on the continued existence of key reinforcements such as policies that subsidise fossil fuels  from a methodological perspective  the outcomes of the delphi study provided a rich source of qualitative material which was highly suitable for developing a system dynamics model  
 exploring the determinants for airport profitability  traffic characteristics  low cost carriers  seasonality and cost efficiency given the growing pressure on aeronautical revenues  the increasing focus on airports  financial performance and the sharpened state aid guidelines in europe  it is valuable to have detailed insight in the determinants for airport profitability  this paper fills in a gap in scientific research by presenting the most important traffic and financial determinants for airport profitability  since the majority of scientific literature on airport  financial  performance focuses on efficiency rather than on profitability  comprehensive airport traffic and financial data for 125 airports in europe  the united states  us   canada  australia and new zealand for the period 2010 2016 have been used to estimate several fixed effects panel data regression on profit margin  among others  the results show evidence for the fact that an increasing share of transfer passengers affects an airport s profit margin  in addition  there is no sign of a general lcc effect and just limited evidence for the fact that the market share of specific lccs affect airport profitability  only an increase in the market share of southwest airlines at major airports leads to lower profit margins  moreover  a quadratic relationship between seasonality and profitability has been identified  it points at the existence of a certain optimal seasonality score  below that tipping point  a decrease in seasonality leads to higher profit margins  on the contrary  a further reduction of seasonality after the tipping point leads to lower profit margins  this might indicate that no or limited seasonality is a result of capacity constraints and  in turn  leads to increasing operating costs related to congestion  regarding financial variables  the results especially show significant positive effects of capital cost efficiencies on profitability  those effects are especially large for airports in the us and for small regional airports  labour productivity only plays a important role in the profitability of us airports  finally  the results show that regional o d airports largely depend on regional economic development and population growth  while the major airports rather depend on global economic development than on an increase in local demand   c  2017 elsevier ltd  all rights reserved  
 exploring the impact of residential relocation on modal shift in commute trips  evidence from a quasi longitudinal analysis a growing number of studies have been devoted to the effects of residential relocation on travel behavior  however  most of these studies only focus on the direct effects of personal and system characteristics  while  residential relocation may trigger several interrelated changes in activity travel behavior and mobility resources  this paper studies the mode choice of commuters who used active transport before relocating  results from a bayesian network  bn  analysis  trained on retrospective data collected in nanjing  china  are presented  the constructed bn identifies significant statistical associations between modal shift and selected explanatory variables  which include movers  socio demographic characteristics  relocation related attributes  and changes in built environment  specifically  car ownership  income  additional car purchase  specific housing type and size  relocation type  change in commute distance  convenience of subway bus for commuting  and distance to subway station are found to be important factors when deciding to switch from private car to public transit  
 exploring the influence of built environment on travel mode choice considering the mediating effects of car ownership and travel distance though there is a growing literature on the connection between the built environment and travel behavior  limited efforts have been made to consider the intermediary nature of car ownership and travel distance simultaneously while modeling the relationship between the built environment and travel mode choice behavior  the mediating effects from car ownership and travel distance  as an important piece  are not sufficiently investigated  to fill this gap  in this study the relationships among travel mode choice  car ownership and travel distance were described using a framework of integrated structural equation model  sem  and discrete choice model  dcm   drawing on a rich dataset of national household travel survey  nhts  and numerous built environment measurements in baltimore metropolitan area  this research applied the integrated sem and dcm approach to investigate how the built environment affects travel mode choice through influencing car ownership and travel distance  therefore  the direct and indirect effects of built environment on travel mode choice were revealed  this study hopes to give transportation planners a better understanding on how the built environment influences travel mode choice  and consequently develop effective and targeted countermeasures to reduce car use   c  2017 elsevier ltd  all rights reserved  
 exploring the mechanisms of vehicle front end shape on pedestrian head injuries caused by ground impact in pedestrian vehicle accidents  pedestrians typically suffer from secondary impact with the ground after the primary contact with vehicles  however  information about the fundamental mechanism of pedestrian head injury from ground impact remains minimal  thereby hindering further improvement in pedestrian safety  this study addresses this issue by using multi body modeling and computation to investigate the influence of vehicle front end shape on pedestrian safety  accordingly  a simulation matrix is constructed to vary bonnet leading edge height  bonnet length  bonnet angle  and windshield angle  subsequently  a set of 315 pedestrian vehicle crash simulations are conducted using the multi body simulation software madymo  three vehicle velocities  i e   20  30  and 40 km h  are set as the scenarios  results show that the top governing factor is bonnet leading edge height  the posture and head injury at the instant of head ground impact vary dramatically with increasing height because of the significant rise of the body bending point and the movement of the collision point  the bonnet angle is the second dominant factor that affects head ground injury  followed by bonnet length and windshield angle  the results may elucidate one of the critical barriers to understanding head injury caused by ground impact and provide a solid theoretical guideline for considering pedestrian safety in vehicle design  
 exploring the psychosocial factors associated with public transportation usage and examining the  gendered  difference understanding the psychosocial factors that influence public transportation usage behavior can provide important implications for transport policies aimed at managing travelers  mobility behavior  in the current study  a four step analysis approach is developed to investigate the psychosocial determinants of public transportation usage behavior within the background of a small sized chinese city  the results suggest that public transportation specific factors including attitude  subjective norm  satisfaction  habit  and behavioral intention  as well as perceived car control  all contribute to explaining the target choice behavior  behavioral intention is confirmed to be the most critical factor that influences public transportation usage behavior  while habit and satisfaction are important mediators in the process defined by the theory of planned behavior  moreover  an examination upon  gendered  difference reflects that effects of both perceived car control and satisfaction vary distinctively across men and women groups  which demonstrates the necessity of demand management differentiation   c  2017 elsevier ltd  all rights reserved  
 exploring the safety in numbers effect for vulnerable road users on a macroscopic scale a  safety in numbers  effect for a certain group of road users is present if the number of crashes increases at a lower rate than the number of road users  the existence of this effect has been invoked to justify investments in multimodal transportation improvements in order to create more sustainable urban transportation systems by encouraging walking  biking  and transit ridership  the goal of this paper is to explore safety in numbers effect for cyclists and pedestrians in areas with different levels of access to multimodal infrastructure  data from chicago served to estimate the expected number of crashes on the census tract level by applying generalized additive models  gam  to capture spatial dependence in crash data  measures of trip generation  multimodal infrastructure  network connectivity and completeness  and accessibility were used to model travel exposure in terms of activity  number of trips  trip length  travel opportunities  and conflicts  the results show that a safety in numbers effect exists on a macroscopic level for motor vehicles  pedestrians  and bicyclists  
 exploring the uncertainty in capacity estimation at roundabouts purpose in gap acceptance theory the critical and the follow up headways have a significant role in determining roundabout entry capacities which in turn depend on circulating flow rates under a specified arrival headway distribution  calculation considers single mean values of the gap acceptance parameters  neglecting the inherent variations in these random variables and providing a single value of entry capacity  the purpose of this paper is to derive the entry capacity distribution which accounts for the variations of the contributing  random  variables and suggest how to consider this issue in the operational analysis of the roundabouts  methods we performed a monte carlo simulation to get the distribution of entry capacity and found crystal ball software effective for performing the random sampling from the probability density functions of each contributing parameter  a steady state model of capacity was used for performing many runs  in each run  the values of each contributing parameter were randomly drawn from the corresponding distributions  results the paper presents the first simulations and the entry capacity distributions at roundabouts  once the probability distributions of the headways were assumed  the results of the analysis were expressed probabilistically  meaning that the probability distributions of capacity rather than the simple point estimates were obtained  conclusions comparing the capacity values based on a meta analytic estimation of critical and follow up headways and the capacity functions based on the probability distributions of the model parameters  more insights in developing an appropriate approach to capacity estimation at roundabouts can be gained

 factors contributing to commercial vehicle rear end conflicts in china  a study using on board event data recorders introduction  in the last 30 years  china has undergone a dramatic increase in vehicle ownership and a resulting escalation in the number of road crashes  although crash figures are decreasing today  they remain high  it is therefore important to investigate crash causation mechanisms to further improve road safety in china  method  to shed more light on the topic  naturalistic driving data was collected in shanghai as part of the evaluation of a behavior based safety service  the data collection included instrumenting 47 vehicles belonging to a commercial fleet with data acquisition systems  from the overall sample  91 rear end crash or near crash  cnc  events  triggered by 24 drivers  were used in the analysis  the cnc were annotated by three researchers  through an expert assessment methodology based on videos and kinematic variables  results  the results show that the main factor behind the rear end cnc was the adoption of very small safety margins  in contrast to results from previous studies in the us  the following vehicles  drivers typically had their eyes on the road and reacted quickly in response to the evolving conflict in most events  when delayed reactions occurred  they were mainly due to driving related visual scanning mismatches  e g   mirror checks  rather than visual distraction  finally  the study identified four main conflict scenarios that represent the typical development of rear end conflicts in this data  conclusions  the findings of this study have several practical applications  such as informing the specifications of in vehicle safety measures and automated driving and providing input into the design of coaching training procedures to improve the driving habits of drivers   c  2017 the authors  published by elsevier ltd  
 fare evasion in public transport  a time series approach an econometric model is presented that identifies the main variables explaining evasion of fare payment on a public transport system  the model uses a cointegration approach  the model parameters are estimated using data from the santiago  chile  bus system  where evasion has been measured at approximately 28   the main results of the model are that  i  a 10  increase in the fare raises evasion by 2 percentage points and  ii  a 10  increase in inspections lowers evasion by 0 8 percentage points  an increase in unemployment  the third explanatory variable in the model  tends to induce a decrease in evasion  and vice versa  this counterintuitive finding may be explained by the fact that those most vulnerable to job loss  and more likely to evade than the average user due to economic necessity  tend to reduce their use of the bus system when unemployment rises and increase it when unemployment falls  our results suggest a revision of the evasion control policy in santiago to improve its effectiveness  and to link inspection efforts to fare increases or to decreases in unemployment   c  2017 elsevier ltd  all rights reserved  
 fatal falls and pfas use in the construction industry  findings from the niosh face reports this study analyzed the construction face database  cfd   a quantitative database developed from reports of the fatality assessment and control evaluation  face  program conducted by the national institute for occupational safety and health  niosh   the cfd contains detailed data on 768 fatalities in the construction industry reported by niosh and individual states from 1982 through june 30  2015  the results show that falls accounted for 42   325  of the 768 fatalities included in the cfd  personal fall arrest systems  pfas  were not available to more than half of the fall decedents  54    nearly one in four fall decedents  23   had access to pfas  but were not using it at the time of the fall  lack of access to pfas was particularly high among residential building contractors as well as roofing  siding  and sheet metal industry sectors  similar to 70    although the findings may not represent the entire construction industry today  they do provide strong evidence in favor of fall protection requirements by the occupational safety and health administration  osha   in addition to stronger enforcement  educating employers and workers about the importance and effectiveness of fall protection is crucial for compliance and fall prevention   c  2017 elsevier ltd  all rights reserved  
 feasibility assessment of various tl 5 safety noise barrier  snb  designs major high speed roads are prevalent in urban areas  and thus there are space constraints in roadside design  particularly when the roadside needs to accommodate both road safety barriers and road noise barriers  a combined road safety barrier and road noise barrier structure is termed a safety noise barrier  snb   this study was established to better understand the issues surrounding structural design of snbs  with a particular emphasis on crashworthy snbs that are capable of achieving a crash test level rating of test level 5  tl 5   a theoretical impact loading model was created after reviewing crash test literature and conducting an indicative vehicle snb crash simulation  a design load of 500 kn was established  incorporating some design scope limitations  nine snb options were developed  and these were priced and analysed through an eight variable multi criteria analysis process  a cost analysis found that snb options based on a standard slip formed tl 5 concrete barrier were cheaper than the systems based on discrete posts with longitudinal rails  also  the use of the tl 5 single slope barrier as a safety barrier element was preferred to the discrete post arrangements  rigid snb systems were also clearly favoured over flexible and partially flexible systems  
 features of fatal injuries in older cyclists in vehicle bicycle accidents in japan objective  the purpose of this study was to identify and better understand the features of fatal injuries in cyclists aged 75years and over involved in collisions with either hood  or van type vehicles methods  this study investigated the fatal injuries of cyclists aged 75years old and over by analyzing accident data  we focused on the body regions to which the fatal injury occurred using vehicle bicycle accident data from the institute for traffic accident research and data analysis  itarda  in japan  using data from 2009 to 2013  we examined the frequency of fatally injured body region by gender  age  and actual vehicle travel speed  we investigated any significant differences in distributions of fatal injuries by body region for cyclists aged 75years and over using chi square tests to compare with cyclists in other age groups  we also investigated the cause of fatal head injuries  such as impact with a road surface or vehicle results  the results indicated that head injuries were the most common cause of fatalities among the study group  at low vehicle travel speeds for both hood  and van type vehicles  fatalities were most likely to be the result of head impacts against the road surface the percentage of fatalities following hip injuries was significantly higher for cyclists aged 75years and over than for those aged 65 74 or 13 59 in impacts with hood type vehicles  it was also higher for women than men in the over 75 age group in impacts with these vehicles conclusions  for cyclists aged 75years and over  wearing a helmet may be helpful to prevent head injuries in vehicle to cyclist accidents  it may also be helpful to introduce some safety measures to prevent hip injuries  given the higher level of fatalities following hip injury among all cyclists aged 75 and over  particularly women  
 feedback control speed harmonization algorithm  methodology and preliminary testing the capacity drop phenomenon  which reduces the maximum bottleneck discharge rate following the onset of congestion  is a critical restriction in transportation networks that produces additional traffic congestion  consequently  preventing or reducing the occurrence of the capacity drop not only mitigates traffic congestion  but can also produce environmental and traffic safety benefits  in addressing this problem  the paper develops a novel bang bang feedback control speed harmonization  sh  or variable speed limit  vsl  algorithm  that attempts to prevent or delay the breakdown of a bottleneck and thus reduce traffic congestion  the novelty of the system lies in the fact that it is both proactive and reactive in responding to the dynamic stochastic nature of traffic  the system is proactive because it uses a calibrated fundamental diagram to initially identify the optimum throughput to maintain within the sh zone  furthermore  the system is reactive  dynamic  because it monitors the traffic stream directly upstream of the bottleneck to adjustment the metering rate to capture the dynamic and stochastic nature of traffic  the steady state traffic states in the vicinity of a lane drop bottleneck before and after applying the sh algorithm is analyzed to demonstrate the effectiveness of the algorithm in alleviating the capacity drop  we demonstrate theoretically that the sh algorithm is effective in enhancing the bottleneck discharge rate  a microscopic simulation of the network using the integration software further demonstrates the benefits of the algorithm in increasing the bottleneck discharge rate  decreasing vehicle delay  and reducing vehicle fuel consumption and co2 emission levels  specifically  compared with the base case without the sh algorithm  the advisory speed limit increases the bottleneck discharge rate by approximately 7   reduces the overall system delay by approximately 20   and reduces the system wide fuel consumption and co2 emission levels by 5    c  2017 elsevier ltd  all rights reserved  
 finding the  faster  path in vehicle routing in this study  the authors improve the faster criterion in vehicle routing by extending the bi delta distribution to the bi normal distribution  which is a reasonable assumption for travel time on each road link  based on this assumption  theoretical models are built for an arbitrary path and subsequently adopted to evaluate two candidate paths through probabilistic comparison  experimental results demonstrate the bi normal behaviour of link travel time in practice  and verify the faster criterion s superiority in determining the optimal path either on an artificial network with bi normal distribution modelling link travel time or on a real road network with real traffic data  this study also validates that when the link number of one path is large  the probability density function of the whole path can be simplified by a normal distribution which approximates the sum of bi normal distributions for each link  
 finding the most reliable strategy on stochastic and time dependent transportation networks  a hypergraph based formulation this study addresses the problem of determining the most reliable time adaptive strategy on a stochastic and time dependent transportation network  the reliability is measured as a conic combination of the mean and standard deviation of travel time and is termed robust cost  the stochastic time dependent network is represented as a directed acyclic hypergraph  where the time adaptive strategies correspond to the hyperpaths  this representation transforms the problem to that of determining the hyperpath with the least robust cost on the constructed hypergraph  the minimum robust cost strategy problem is difficult to solve because of the non linear objective function  consequently  the solution procedures commonly adopted in the literature  that are based on substrategy optimality and substrategy non dominance  are not applicable to this problem  in this light  we propose a novel bounds based iterative algorithm that determines the minimum robust cost strategy on the stochastic and time dependent networks  this algorithm needs to determine the least and k best strategies in the second moment of travel time  for which an efficient procedure is also proposed  the algorithm is shown to be exact and exhibit parameterically polynomial behavior  computational tests were performed to demonstrate its efficiency  further  tests showed that the minimum robust cost strategy compromises little in terms of the mean travel time  0 2  2 9    compared to least expected travel time strategy  with significant reduction in travel time variability  6 2  29 8    
 findings from measuring door to door travellers  travel satisfaction with traditional and smartphone app survey methods in eight european cities this study investigates how different travel satisfaction survey methods influence the reported level of door to door travel satisfaction among travellers  the travel satisfaction measurement survey tools tested consisted of two types of smartphone applications  a satellite navigation app and a game app   an on line survey  a paper based semi structured questionnaire and a focus group  each of the measurement tools comprised of a similar set of questions  but in different formats  aimed at exploring the pros and cons of each tool among different group of travellers  in total  5 275 valid responses were collected during the survey period from eight european cities and five fia  federation internationale de i automobile  national motorist networks  the analysis results  with ordered logit model of travellers  reported overall satisfaction  showed that the travel satisfaction reported by different survey methods and different travel modes and user groups  correlated with distinct groups of key determinants  the relationship between and within these key determinants  however  was far from straight forward  some were more complex than others  some issues  such as parking availability and security  that are mostly discussed by policy makers and users may not be the ones that directly correlate with the users  overall travel satisfactions  consistent with previous studies  the travellers  mood and previous experience influenced the reported overall journey satisfaction  
 fine particle emission characteristics of a light duty diesel vehicle according to vehicle acceleration and road grade the characteristics of fine particle emission from a light duty diesel vehicle operated on a chassis dynamometer were investigated according to vehicle acceleration and road grade  particle number  pn  concentration and particle mass  pm  concentration were measured using a solid particle counting system  spcs   an engine exhaust particle sizer  eeps   and a dekati low pressure impactor  dlpi   in this study  actual mass distribution of particles emitted from the tested diesel vehicle was determined by sampling the particles on 25 mm teflon coated filters installed at 13 impactor stages of the dlpi and then compared with the particle mass distribution converted from the particle number distribution measured by the eeps  in order to evaluate the characteristics of fine particle emission under various conditions of vehicle acceleration and road grade  testing was conducted with or without installing a diesel particulate filter  dpf   in general  pn and pm concentrations increased with both increasing vehicle acceleration and increasing road grade   c  2017 elsevier ltd  all rights reserved  
 first last mile transit access as an equity planning issue previous studies have established that residents of low income neighborhoods in major metropolitan areas have access to many more jobs by car than by transit  in this paper  we revisit this question and present evidence on how the mode of transit station access  egress  by walking  bicycling  or driving  can importantly influence the gap between car and transit accessibility in the san diego region  we construct two accessibility measures to analyze low wage job access by transit   1  the number of low wage jobs accessible within a 30 min commute and  2  the number of low wage jobs within a 30 min commute adjusted by the number of potentially competing workers who live within 30 min  we then simulate several policy changes that could reduce the difference in transit vs car accessibility  examples include using faster station access egress modes such as bicycling and driving to or from transit stations and reducing transit service wait time  our results demonstrate that in the san diego region  if transit riders walk to from transit stops  low wage job accessibility by car is almost 30 times larger than low wage job accessibility by public transit  we find that changing the mode of access and egress to and from stations is more effective at improving transit access to low wage jobs than policies that reduce transit wait time or improve service headway  given the transition of transportation to a  service  or  sharing  economy  these results have important implications for how to improve access to employment in low income neighborhoods   c  2017 elsevier ltd  all rights reserved

 gate violation behavior at highway rail grade crossings and the consequences  using geo spatial modeling integrated with path analysis drivers undertaking risky behaviors at highway rail grade crossings are often severely injured in collisions with trains  among these behaviors  gate violation  referring to driving around or through the gates that were activated and lowered by an approaching train  seems to be one of the most dangerous actions a driver might take at a gated crossing  it may compromise the intended safety improvement made by adding gates at crossings  this study develops a nuanced conceptual framework that uses path analysis to explore the contributing factors to gate violation behaviors and the correlation between gate violation behaviors and the crash consequence the driver injury severity  further  using geo spatial modeling techniques  this study explores whether the correlates of gate violation behaviors and their associations with injury severity are stationary across diverse geographic contexts of the united states  geo spatial modeling shows that the correlates of gate violation and its associations with injury severity vary substantially across the united states  spatial variations in correlates of gate violation and injury severity are mapped by estimating geographically weighted regressions  the maps can serve as an instrument for screening safety improvements and help identify regions that need safety improvements  for example  the results show that two quadrant gates are more likely to have gate violation crashes than four quadrant gates in iowa  illinois  wisconsin and minnesota  these states may need to receive more attentions on the enforcement of inhibiting gate violation at crossings with two quadrant gates or have the priority over other states to upgrade these crossings to four quadrant gates if financially feasible  
 gender differences in attitudes towards driving and demand for private insurance  evidence from middle class drivers this article examines the existence of associations between the gender of the driver  their risk behavior when driving motor vehicles and their inclination to acquire automobile insurance  to conduct this investigation a random survey was carried out with 566 middle class adults in 66 brazilian towns and cities  by using non parametric tests and logit models  the results suggest that even when controlling for other variables  women feel a greater need to have automobile insurance to protect themselves in the event of possible accidents under rainy conditions and also to have access to driver support services  women also tend to have more respect for speed limits in various situations  such as during the rush hour  on local roads and on highways  the results also showed that men feel safer than women driving in more precarious situations  at night  in unfamiliar areas  after drinking  or even when they are tired  these results  in addition to contributing to the theoretical development of road traffic and transportation safety  are of special relevance to the financial industry and the regulatory agency  the insurance industry may find these results particularly helpful in designing future policies and setting premiums   c  2017 elsevier ltd  all rights reserved  
 gender inequality in mobility and mode choice in pakistan using the nationally representative dataset of the 2007 pakistan time use survey  this paper examines gender differences in daily trip rate  mode choice  travel duration  and purpose of travel  which are previously unreported because of limited data availability  wide gender mobility gaps are observed in the country  where women are less likely to travel  are half as mobile as men and may rely heavily on walking  the particular social and cultural context of the country  that renders women as private  secluded and family honor  seems influential in shaping their mobility and choice of activities  demographic factors such as age  household income  and marital status significantly decrease female mobility levels  hence  these findings call for a gender based culturally responsive transportation policy in the country  
 gender roles  sex and the expression of driving anger the present study investigated the validity of the 25 item driving anger expression inventory  dax  as well as the role of sex and gender roles in relation to the expression of driving anger in a sample of 378 french drivers  males   38   m   32 9 years old   confirmatory factor analysis supported the four factor structure of the 25 item dax  adaptive constructive expression  use of the vehicle to express anger  verbal aggressive expression and personal physical aggressive expression  and two of the three aggressive factors were found to have significant positive relationships with driving anger  while adaptive constructive expression was negatively related to driving anger  use of the vehicle to express anger was not significantly related to crash involvement  but was significantly related to all other crash related conditions  traffic tickets  loss of concentration  loss of control of the vehicle  near crash   the presence of feminine traits  but not sex  was predictive of adaptive constructive behaviours  while masculine traits predicted more frequent verbal aggressive expression  use of the vehicle to express anger  personal physical aggressive expression and total aggressive expression  this finding may account for the inconsistent relationship found between driving anger and sex in previous research  this research also found that the 25 item dax is a valid tool to measure the expression of driving anger and that the endorsement of masculine traits are related to more aggressive forms of driving anger expression  
 geographically weighted negative binomial regression applied to zonal level safety performance models generalized linear models  glm  with negative binomial distribution for errors  have been widely used to estimate safety at the level of transportation planning  the limited ability of this technique to take spatial effects into account can be overcome through the use of local models from spatial regression techniques  such as geographically weighted poisson regression  gwpr   although gwpr is a system that deals with spatial dependency and heterogeneity and has already been used in some road safety studies at the planning level  it fails to account for the possible overdispersion that can be found in the observations on road traffic crashes  two approaches were adopted for the geographically weighted negative binomial regression  gwnbr  model to allow discrete data to be modeled in a non stationary form and to take note of the overdispersion of the data  the first examines the constant overdispersion for all the traffic zones and the second includes the variable for each spatial unit  this research conducts a comparative analysis between non spatial global crash prediction models and spatial local gwpr and gwnbr at the level of traffic zones in fortaleza brazil  a geographic database of 126 traffic zones was compiled from the available data on exposdre  network characteristics  socioeconomic factors and land use  the models were calibrated by using the frequency of injury crashes as a dependent variable and the results showed that gwpr and gwnbr achieved a better performance than glm for the average residuals and likelihood as well as reducing the spatial autocorrelation of the residuals  and the gwnbr model was more able to capture the spatial heterogeneity of the crash frequency  
 get on board  assessing an all door boarding pilot project in montreal  canada transit agencies often focus on developing strategies aimed at reducing travel time to increase passengers  satisfaction  one strategy used by transit agencies to reduce passenger activity time  and accordingly travel times  is the implementation of all door boarding  a service allowing transit users to board and alight vehicles through any door  the present study uses data collected in montreal  canada  to assess the impacts of an all door boarding pilot project from two points of view   1  operationally through passenger activity time  and  2  by assessing passenger satisfaction  operationally  the results reveal that when compared to a similar bus route that does not allow all door boarding  the all door boarding strategy shows a savings of five percent in passenger activity time at regular stops  while time savings at high passenger activity stops such as metro stations experienced time savings of around 19 percent  thus  savings are maximized at stops with high passenger demand  additionally  with regard to user perceptions  the results reveal that passengers who use the all door boarding service are more satisfied with bus service  particularly with on time performance  overall  the results of this study demonstrate that all door boarding is an effective strategy to improve the quality of service due to the associated time savings and increased customer satisfaction  finally  the study offers important recommendations to transit planners and policy makers to effectively implement and maximize the benefits of an all door boarding policy based on statistical analysis and on site observations   c  2017 elsevier ltd  all rights reserved  
 getting around a license plate ban  behavioral responses to mexico city s driving restriction license plate based driving restrictions are among the highest profile policies for local governments to address congestion and air pollution  cities as varied as sao paulo  paris  tianjin  and new delhi have enacted temporary or permanent restrictions to improve local air quality  using household travel survey data and a research design based on the abrupt shift in how the policy applies to 10 year old vs  9 year old vehicles  we evaluate the impact of hoy no circula  one of the earliest and most studied driving restrictions  in mexico city  in line with previous studies  we find that hoy no circula has done little to reduce overall vehicle travel  but we reject the prevailing theory that its lack of success is due to perverse incentives for households to buy second cars  instead  we highlight the range of other  less costly ways that people adjust behavior to avoid the restrictions  although no single behavior dominates  most households   particularly those that own older  higher polluting vehicles   do not use their car every weekday regardless of the restriction  as a result  it is relatively easy to shuffle travel from restricted days to unrestricted days and thus avoid the ban  shuffling travel days is less costly  more immediately available  and far simpler for most households than buying a second car   c  2017 elsevier ltd  all rights reserved  
 glass half full  on road glance metrics differentiate crashes from near crashes in the 100 car data background  much of the driver distraction and inattention work to date has focused on concerns over drivers removing their eyes from the forward roadway to perform non driving related tasks  and its demonstrable link to safety consequences when these glances are timed at inopportune moments  this extensive literature has established  through the analyses of glance from naturalistic datasets  a clear relationship between eyes off road  lead vehicle closing kinematics  and near crash crash involvement  objective  this paper looks at the role of driver expectation in influencing drivers  decisions about when and for how long to remove their eyes from the forward roadway in an analysis that consider the combined role of on and off road glances  method  using glance data collected in the 100 car naturalistic driving study  nds   near crashes were examined separately from crashes to examine how momentary differences in glance allocation over the 25 s prior to a precipitating event can differentiate between these two distinct outcomes  individual glance metrics of mean single glance duration  msgd   total glance time  tgt   and glance count for off road and on road glance locations were analyzed  output from the attend algorithm  kircher and ahlstrom  2009  was also analyzed as a hybrid measure  in threading together on and off road glances over time  its output produces a pattern of glance behavior meaningful for examining attentional effects  results  individual glance metrics calculated at the epoch level and binned by 10 s units of time across the available epoch lengths revealed that drivers in near crashes have significantly longer on road glances  and look less frequently between on and off road locations in the moments preceding a precipitating event as compared to crashes  during on road glances  drivers in near crashes were found to more frequently sample peripheral regions of the roadway than drivers in crashes  output from the attend algorithm affirmed the cumulative net benefit of longer on road glances and of improved attention management between on and off road locations  conclusion the finding of longer on road glances differentiating between safety critical outcomes in the 100 car nds data underscores the importance of attention management in how drivers look both on and off the road  it is in the pattern of glances to and from the forward roadway that drivers obtained critical information necessary to inform their expectation of hazard potential to avoid a crash  application  this work may have important implications for attention management in the context of the increasing prevalence of in vehicle demands as well as of vehicle automation  
 global airline alliances and profitability  a difference in difference analysis alliances and partnerships between airlines are entered into to create competitive advantage  reduce costs  and expand network reach  three global alliance clusters emerged  with founding partners located in the major geographic regions  and often already involved in bilateral partnerships with other founders  this study examines whether the formation of global airline alliances  with its related expansion of network reach  resulted in an increase in profitability for the founding members  employing difference in difference regressions  this study has found no evidence that the formation of global alliances improved the profitability of founding member airlines  or conferred an economic advantage over airlines that were not founding members  this result is robust across geographic regions  individual global alliances  and alternative event dates  the results of this research suggest that regulators should be less anxious that by sanctioning these closer relationships they are providing major carriers with opportunities for excessive profits   c  2017 elsevier ltd  all rights reserved  
 goal based models for discrete choice analysis goals direct decision making  from the most abstract levels of motivation to the multitudinous details of evaluation of options available for choice  however  the pervasive influence of goals in decision processes is generally not explicitly recognized at the level of demand model formulation and specification  in applied economics generally  and transportation specifically  demand models relate product service attributes directly to behavior  using utility  or value  as a shorthand representation for the impact of goals  in this paper we argue that this is a limiting view that restricts our thinking about decision making and  hence  our representation and inference making about that behavior  we support this argument by reinterpreting and or extending various applications of hybrid models in transportation to a goal based framework and formulating goal based choice models which recognize that goals  1  are drivers of choice   2  explain the choice of strategy   3  are part of the constraint set and  4  contribute to explaining impacts of the decision context on the allocation of cognitive resources by the decision maker   c  2017 elsevier ltd  all rights reserved  
 green accessibility  estimating the environmental costs of network time prisms for sustainable transportation planning accessibility  or the ease to participate in activities and obtain resources in a given environment  is crucial for evaluating transportation systems  greater accessibility is often achieved by increasing individuals  potential mobility  however  potential mobility  if realized by motorized modes  can also generate negative environmental impacts such as fossil fuel consumption and greenhouse gas  ghg  emissions  while the negative environmental impacts of greater mobility are acknowledged  there has been a lack of research to validate those impacts using empirical data  especially considering variations in individuals  mobility levels  this paper presents a method for estimating the expected environmental costs of accessibility represented by a network time prism  ntp   a ntp delimits all accessible locations within a network and the available time for an individual to present at each location given a scheduled trip origin and destination  a time budget and the maximum achievable speeds along network edges  estimating the expected environmental costs of a ntp involves three steps   1  semi markov techniques to simulate the probabilities to move along network edges at given times   2  the speed profiles for reachable edges  and  3  a cost function that translates speeds into environmental impacts  we focus on air quality and employ the motor vehicle emission simulator moveslite to estimate the co2 emissions at both the edge and prism levels  we calibrate and validate the methods for experimental ntps defined within the phoenix  az  usa road and highway network using vehicles instrumented with gps enabled onboard diagnostic devices  obd   we demonstrate the effectiveness of our method through two scenarios and investigate the impact of changes in mobility levels on the expected co2 emissions associated with the experimental ntps  
 greenhouse gas and air quality effects of auto first last mile use with transit with potential for automobiles to cause increased greenhouse gas emissions and air pollution relative to other modes  there is concern that using automobiles to access or egress public transportation may significantly increase the environmental impacts from door to door transit trips  yet little rigorous work has been developed that quantitatively assesses the effects of transit access or egress by automobiles  this research evaluates the life cycle impacts of first and last mile trips on multimodal transit  an environmental life cycle assessment of transit and automobile travel in the greater los angeles region is developed to evaluate the impacts of multimodal transit trips by utilizing existing transportation life cycle assessment methods  first last mile automobile trips with transit may increase multimodal trip emissions significantly  mitigating potential impact reductions from transit usage  in some cases  multimodal transit trips with first last mile automobile use may have higher emissions than competing automobile trips  in the near term  first last mile automobile trips in some los angeles transit services may account for up to 66  of multimodal greenhouse gas emissions  and as much as 75  of multimodal air quality impacts  fossil fuel energy generation and combustion  low vehicle occupancies  and longer trip distances contribute most to increased multimodal impacts  supply chain analysis indicates that life cycle air quality impacts may occur largely locally  in los angeles  or largely remotely depending on the propulsion method and location of upstream life cycle processes  reducing 10  of transit system greenhouse emissions requires a shift of 23 50  of automobile first last mile trips to a neutral emissions mode   c  2017 elsevier ltd  all rights reserved

 hardware trojan detection game  a prospect theoretic approach outsourcing integrated circuit  ic  manufacturing to offshore foundries has grown exponentially in recent years  given the critical role of ics in the control and operation of vehicular systems and other modern engineering designs  such offshore outsourcing has led to serious security threats due to the potential of insertion of hardware trojans malicious designs that  when activated  can lead to highly detrimental consequences  in this paper  a novel game theoretic framework is proposed to analyze the interactions between a hardware manufacturer  acting as an attacker  and an ic testing facility  acting as a defender  the problem is formulated as a noncooperative game in which the attacker must decide on the type of trojan that it inserts while taking into account the detection penalty as well as the damage caused by the trojan  meanwhile  the resource constrained defender must decide on the best testing strategy that allows optimizing its overall utility which accounts for both damages and the fines  the proposed game is based on the robust behavioral framework of prospect theory  pt  which allows capturing the potential uncertainty  risk  and irrational behavior in the decision making of both the attacker and defender  for both the standard rational expected utility  eut  case and the pt case  a novel algorithm based on fictitious play is proposed and shown to converge to a mixed strategy nash equilibrium  for an illustrative case study  thorough analytical results are derived for both eut and pt to study the properties of the reached equilibrium as well as the impact of key system parameters such as the defender set fine  simulation results assess the performance of the proposed framework under both eut and pt and show that the use of pt will provide invaluable insights on the outcomes of the proposed hardware trojan game  in particular  and system security  in general  
 harnessing big data for estimating the energy consumption and driving range of electric vehicles analyzing the factors that affect the energy efficiency of vehicles is crucial to the overall improvement of the environmental efficiency of the transport sector  one of the top polluting sectors at the global level  this study analyses the energy consumption rate  ecr  and driving range of battery electric vehicles  bevs  and provides insight into the factors that affect their energy consumption by harnessing big data from real world driving  the analysis relied on four data sources   i  driving patterns collected from 741 drivers over a two year period   ii  drivers  characteristics   iii  road type   iv  weather conditions  the results of the analysis measure the mean ecr of bevs at 0 183 kw h km  underline a 34  increase in ecr and a 25  decrease in driving range in the winter with respect to the summer  and suggest the electricity tariff for bevs to be cost efficient with respect to conventional ones  moreover  the results of the analysis show that driving speed  acceleration and temperature have non linear effects on the ecr  while season and precipitation level have a strong linear effect  the econometric model of the ecr of bevs suggests that the optimal driving speed is between 45 and 56 km h and the ideal temperature from an energy efficiency perspective is 14 degrees c  clearly  the performance of bevs highly depends on the driving environment  the driving patterns  and the weather conditions  and the findings from this study enlighten the consumers to be more informed and manufacturers to be more aware about the actual utilization of bevs   c  2017 published by elsevier ltd  
 hazard perception in young cyclists and adult cyclists child bicyclists are at greater risk to get involved in a traffic accident  although hazard perception tests between inexperienced and experienced car drivers revealed significant differences in perceptual cognitive skills  a similar test for bicyclists is not yet existent  therefore this study aimed to compare visual search patterns and reaction times of child bicyclists and adult bicyclists utilizing a hazard perception test for cyclists  seventy five children and forty one adults were presented with eleven video clips filmed from the perspective of the bicyclist  the participants were required to press a response button whenever they detected a hazardous situation  children were found to have significantly delayed reaction times and time until the first fixation on the latent covert hazards compared to adults  the inefficient visual search patterns in children may be attributed to an immature visual system  however  the finding that children fixated later on the hazards and only responded to the covert latent hazards when they became salient indicate difficulties with identifying possible hazards  altogether  the findings of this study suggest that children s situation awareness is dependent upon experience too  and not just maturation  therefore  implications for training young bicyclists will be discussed   c  2016 elsevier ltd  all rights reserved

 hazard perception training in young bicyclists improves early detection of risk  a cluster randomized controlled trial introduction  since child bicyclists are more likely to get involved in a traffic crash  there is a stringent need to provide child bicyclists with tailored interventions in order to enhance their capabilities to deal with the complexity of traffic situations  the current study therefore aimed to test the effectiveness of a hazard anticipation training in young bicyclists by means of eye tracking technology  methods  a cluster randomized controlled design was used in which participating schools were randomly assigned to the intervention or the control group  at first  a baseline hazard anticipation test was carried out in the intervention group  78 children  9 56     0 38 years of age  and the control group  46 children  9 58     0 41 years of age   child bicyclists who participated in the intervention followed the training that consisted of two classroom sessions  in each session children were presented with video clips from the perspective of a bicyclist encountering various  potentially  dangerous traffic situations  following the intervention  a post test directly after the training and a retention test three weeks later were completed  the control group received the intervention after the retention test  results  trained child bicyclists were found to detect more hazards and reacted quicker compared to the control group that did not receive the training  however  the training did not result in improvements in anticipatory visual search behaviour  conclusion  trained child bicyclists seemed to have developed a better processing regarding potential dangerous situations but were not able to  see  the hazard sooner  the potential of a brief hazard anticipation training is discussed  
 health and greenhouse gas mitigation benefits of ambitious expansion of cycling  walking  and transit in california the purpose of this research was to quantify health co benefits and carbon reductions of preferred scenarios of california regional transportation plans and alternatives with ambitious levels of active transport  the alternatives were designed to examine the efficacy of independent contributions of walking  bicycling  and transit at levels consistent with the u s  surgeon general recommendation for physical activity  using data from travel and health surveys  vital statistics  collision databases  and outputs from regional and statewide travel models  the integrated transport and health impacts model estimated the change in the population disease burden  as measured by deaths and disability adjusted life years  dalys   due to a shift from a 2010 baseline travel pattern to an alternative  health pathways modeled were physical activity and road traffic injuries  the preferred scenarios increased statewide active transport from 40 5 to 53 4 min person  1  w  1   which was associated with an annual decrease of 909 deaths and 16 089 dalys  sensitivity analyses that accounted for 2040 projected age  and sex specific population characteristics and cause specific mortality rates did not appreciably alter the annual change in deaths and dalys on a population basis  the ambitious  maximal alternatives increased population mean travel duration to 283 min person  1  w  1  for walking  bicycling  or transit and were associated a reduction in deaths and dalys from 2 5 to 12 times greater than the california preferred scenarios  the alternative with the largest health impact was bicycling 283 min person  1  w  1  which led to 8 543 fewer annual deaths and 194 003 fewer dalys  despite an increase in bicyclist injuries  with anticipated population growth  no alternative achieved decreases in carbon emissions but bicycling had the greatest potential for slowing their growth  alternatives that included transit similarly reduced carbon emissions  but with less health benefit  aggressive expansion of active transport is an efficacious  but underutilized policy option with significant health co benefits for mitigating greenhouse gases  
 health impacts of cycling in dublin on individual cyclists and on the local population there is an emerging consensus that personal and societal health benefits in cycling largely outweigh the risks  however  there exists limited research into the health impacts experienced by individuals who take up cycling or the marginal societal benefits resulting from incremental uptake of cycling  this paper models and estimates the health impacts of individuals in dublin taking up cycling  the paper utilizes the 2011 census data of ireland and a burden of disease  bod  approach is used to estimate health impacts on the individuals taking up cycling for their regular commute and on the rest of the local population separately  the health impact to an individual changing from private car to cycling ranged from a benefit of 0 033 disability adjusted life years  dalys  year to a loss of 0 003 dalys year  the marginal health impact to the local population ranged from no change to a benefit of 0 006 dalys year  increases in cycling have a consistently positive impact on the health of the local population  regardless of the current modal split  the net expected health impacts to the individual cyclists are also positive in most cases  however  for some individuals in the 20 29 age group  the expected health impact may be small to negative  mainly due to a higher traffic collision risk  where total impacts of scenarios are modelled the potential negative health impacts to some individuals may be masked by the overall positive health benefits of cycling to the local population  when promoting cycling as an alternative to driving to improve population health impacts  the risks to some cyclists should be managed and mitigated through safe road systems approaches  
 health impacts of urban transport policy measures  a guidance note for practice background urban transport related exposures and practices are associated with a significant burden of morbidity and premature mortality  which could be prevented by changing current practices  cities now have access to an increasingly wide range of transport policy measures which continue to expand  however  the health impacts of these measures are not always explicitly defined or well understood and therefore may not be sufficiently considered when selecting policy measures  aims  the aim of this paper is to qualitatively review 64 different transport policy measures indexed in the knowledgebase on sustainable urban land use and transport  konsult   and provide an indication of their potential health impacts  based on expert judgment  results  we report that key health impacts of transport occur via pathways of motor vehicle crashes  traffic related air pollution  noise  heat islands  lack of green space  physical inactivity  climate change and social exclusion and community severance  we systematically describe the expected health impacts of transport policy measures sourced from konsult and fmd that many  but not all  can have a positive impact on health  the magnitude of both the positive and negative impacts remains largely unknown and warrants further research and synthesis  conclusions  uiban transport is responsible for a large mortality and morbidity burden and policy measures that are beneficial to health need to be implemented to reduce this burden  there are considerable differences between these policy measures in terms of potential health impacts and this should be considered in any transport planning  it is important to monitor the health impacts of all policy measures to provide further evidence on whether they work as expected or not  to ensure that the most cost effective solutions  with the largest benefits and the smallest health risks  are being adopted

 hedonic value of high speed rail services  quantitative analysis of the students  domestic tourist attractiveness of the main italian cities high speed rail  hsr  is a transport mode that operates significantly faster than traditional services  using integrated and specialized rolling stock  and often dedicated tracks  these rapid transit services have profoundly impacted mobility habits on medium long range journeys  and have also brought about social  economic  and environmental changes in the geographical areas involved  hsr has become a successful  brand   including not only faster trains  but also a number of other on board services that increase rail attractiveness  e g  restaurants  wi fi connection  free newspapers  cinema  business areas and relaxation lounges   starting from these considerations  in this research we investigated the conjecture according to which a traveler  in choosing an hsr service to reach a destination  against a traditional rail service  or other competing transport modes   is not only influenced by its original peculiarity as a  faster train  service  but also takes into account the presence of all the  hedonic  characteristics of the service  that said  the literature in transportation modeling has yet to analyze the impact of hedonic quality on travelers  behavior by quantifying whether and to what extent it increases their propensity to use hsr services  aim of this research was twofold  i  to quantify  for the first time in the literature  the hedonic value of an hsr service related to a domestic tourist trip  as compared to more conventional levels of service and attractiveness attributes  ii  investigate the domestic tourist attractiveness of the main italian cities  evaluating which attributes influence the perception of a city as a domestic tourist destination  the application case study consists in the supply of current rail services  hsr vs  traditional  between the 11 main italian cities in terms of tourist destination  on the basis of an rp sp survey  carried out among university students at national scale  a binomial logit model was specified with serial correlation in residuals  estimating whether or not the cities in the panel were perceived as possible destinations for a domestic tourist trips made by train  the estimation results show that city specific attractiveness attributes  entertainment and restaurant rate  number of sites of interests  crime rate   and level of services variables  e g  travel time and cost  hsr brand  significantly influence the perception of a city as a possible destination for a domestic tourist trip by train  furthermore  the average monetary value for the  pure preference  for the hsr brand  faster trains  high frequency  and on board services  is about 22 euros trip  while the hedonic value relative only to on board services is about 12 euros trip  underlining that the  faster train  is only one of the perceived attributes of hsr services  overall  the willingness to pay for an hsr ticket is up to 40  greater than that for a traditional one  furthermore  tourists are willing to spend 2 2 h more travelling on an hsr train to reach their destinations  the estimation results show that there is also a  distance traveled effect   the pure preference for hsr services increases in value from 9 euros trip to 13 euros trip   44   for distances traveled greater than 400 km  if confirmed  these results allow the conclusion to be drawn that the  catchment area  of cities on hsr networks is larger than that served by traditional rail   c  2017 elsevier ltd  all rights reserved  
 herd behavior in the drybulk market  an empirical analysis of the decision to invest in new and retire existing fleet capacity we examine whether investors herd in their decision to order or scrap vessels in the dry bulk market  we decompose herding into unintentional and intentional  and test for herd behavior under asymmetric effects with respect to freight market states  cycle phases  risk return and valuation profiles  and ownership of the vessel  we detect unintentional herd behavior during down freight markets and contractions  furthermore  we find evidence of spill over unintentional herding effects from the newbuilding to the scrap market  finally  asymmetric herd effects are evident between traditional and liberal philosophy towards the ownership of the vessel  and during extreme risk return and valuation periods   c  2017 elsevier ltd  all rights reserved  
 heterogeneity within and across households in hurricane evacuation response a survey of houston area households reveals responses to hurricane ike in 2008 were as diverse as the households themselves  review of evacuation literature shows this remains a fundamental problem  in our analysis no clear correlations between household attributes and evacuation motivators emerge unless the respondents are organized into subpopulations based on household attributes and the stated concerns of survey respondents  these subpopulations overlap so that most households fall within multiple classifications  evidence that heterogeneity across households is also present within them  to address heterogeneity within households  an information content metric  information entropy  is considered a proxy for issue saliency  focusing on the most salient responses to survey questions makes it possible to isolate some of the factors important in the decision to evacuate and the characteristics of the households for which those factors are most important  regression analysis of the most salient issues of the most concerned respondents informs the creation of behavioral rules for an agent based model populated with the survey data  the relative strengths of the risk averting behavior rules are tuned through monte carlo simulations using the actual evacuation time of each household as the fitness metric  
 heterogeneous hazard model of pev users charging intervals  analysis of four year charging transactions data public charging infrastructure represents a key success factor in the promotion of plug in electric vehicles  pev   given that a large initial investment is required for the widespread adoption of pev  many studies have addressed the location choice problem for charging infrastructure using a priori simple assumptions  ideally  however  identifying optimal locations of charging stations necessitates an understanding of charging behavior  limited market penetration of pev makes it difficult to grasp any regularities in charging behavior  using a dutch data set about four years of charging transactions  this study presents a detailed analysis of inter charging times  recognizing that pev users may exhibit different charging behavior  this study estimates a latent class hazard duration model  which accommodates duration dependence  unobserved heterogeneity and the effects of time varying covariates  pev users are endogenously classified into regular and random users by treating charging regularity as a latent variable  the paper provides valuable insights into the dynamics of charging behavior at public charging stations  and which strategies can be successfully used to improve the performance of public charging infrastructure   c  2017 elsevier ltd  all rights reserved  
 hierarchical ordered model for injury severity of pedestrian crashes in south korea introduction  the high percentage of fatalities in pedestrian involved crashes is a critical social problem  the purpose of this study is to investigate factors influencing injury severity in pedestrian crashes by examining the demographic and socioeconomic characteristics of the regions where crashes occurred  method  to understand the correlation between the unobserved characteristics of pedestrian crashes in a defined region  we apply a hierarchical ordered model  in which we set crash characteristics as lower level variables and municipality characteristics as upper level  pedestrian crash data were collected and analyzed for a three year period from 2011 to 2013  the estimation results show the statistically significant factors that increase injury severity of pedestrian crashes  results  at the crash level  the factors associated with increased severity of pedestrian injury include intoxicated drivers  road crossing pedestrians  elderly pedestrians  heavy vehicles  wide roads  darkness  and fog  at the municipality level  municipalities with low population density  lower level of financial independence  fewer doctors  and a higher percentage of elderly residents experience more severe pedestrian crashes  municipalities ranked as having the top 10  pedestrian fatality rate  fatalities per 100 000 residents  have rates 7 4 times higher than municipalities with the lowest 10  rate of fatalities  their demographic and socioeconomic characteristics also have significant differences  the proposed model accounts for a 7  unexplained variation in injury severity outcomes between the municipalities where crashes occurred  conclusion  to enhance the safety of vulnerable pedestrians  considerable investments of time and effort in pedestrian safety facilities and zones should be made  more certain and severe punishments should be also given for the traffic violations that increase injury severity of pedestrian crashes  furthermore  central and local governments should play a cooperative role to reduce pedestrian fatalities  practical applications  based on our study results  we suggest policy directions to enhance pedestrian safety   c  2017 the authors  published by elsevier ltd on behalf of national safety council  
 high resolution multi scale air quality modelling for all streets in denmark the annual concentrations of no2  pm2 5 and pk in 2012 have for the first time been modelled for all 2 4 million addresses in denmark based on a multi scale air quality modelling approach  all addresses include residential  industrial  institutional  shop  school  restaurant addresses etc  the approach is based on a suite of chemistry transport models all developed at aarhus university and includes regional modelling  urban background modelling and street modelling  information about traffic volumes is based on a newly developed national danish transport model  and national travel speed data have been obtained from a recent dataset based on gps readings of vehicles  air quality model results are validated by comparisons with measurements obtained from the fixed site monitoring stations under the danish air quality monitoring programme  the validation showed that calculated street concentrations of no2 for the five available street monitoring stations are within 27  to  12   the model results were also verified with comparisons with previous model results for no2 at 98 selected streets in copenhagen and 31 streets in aalborg  the verification showed good correlation in copenhagen  r 2    0 70  and fairly good agreement in aalborg  r 2    0 60   the target groups for the air quality mapping of all danish addresses are the general public for information and awareness about air quality  and local and national authorities whom may use the information as a screening tool for air quality assessment  the air quality map has been provided on a webgis platform on the internet in september 2016  http   luftenpaadinvej au dk   the air quality map is named airstreet for air quality at your street   c  2017 the authors  published by elsevier ltd  
 high speed rail and urban service industry agglomeration  evidence from china s yangtze river delta region high speed rail  hsr  services shorten space time distances between cities and induce the reallocation of production resources between regions  cities   based on the data of 25 cities in china s yangtze river delta region during 1995 2014  this paper uses the  continuous  difference in differences model to investigate the influence of hsr on urban service industry agglomeration  the results show that hsr has a positive effect on the urban service industry agglomeration of the cities located along the rail lines  compared with cities not located along the rail lines  hsr does not weaken the service industry agglomeration of the medium and small sized cities that are also situated along the rail lines and around the core city  the service intensity of hsr  which is measured by train service frequency  also exhibits a significant effect on the service industry agglomeration of those cities located along the rail lines  higher levels of hsr service intensity have a greater effect on urban service industry agglomeration  in addition  we further subdivide the category of service industry into producer service  consumer service  and public service industries  we find that hsr has a significant impact on producer service industry agglomeration  but hsr s influences on consumer service industry and public service industry are insignificant  
 hitting the sweet spot  variability in commute lengths and vehicle emissions across a diverse state in this paper we consider travel across virginia and identify sustainability  sweet spots  where commute lengths and vehicle emissions per mile combine to maximize green travel in terms of total co2 emissions associated with commuting  the analysis is conducted across local voter precincts  n   2373 in the state  because they are a useful proxy for neighborhoods and well sized for implementing policy designed to encourage sustainable travel behavior  virginia is especially appropriate for an examination of variability in sustainable travel behavior and technologies because the state s transportation  demographic  and political patterns are particularly diverse and have been changing rapidly  we identify four virginia precinct based sustainability clusters  sweet spots  emerging sweet spots  neutral and non sustaining  a model of demographic differences among the clusters shows that sustainability outcomes  understood in terms of both local commute behavior and vehicle emissions  are significantly associated with the diverse demography and politics of the state  we also look at changes in transportation sustainability and socio demographic trends within the clusters over the past half decade  showing that differences in sustainability and demographic metrics are actually accelerating within the state over time  we conclude with a discussion of the implications of the differences among the clusters for developing and implementing effective transportation sustainability policies across the state   c  2017 elsevier ltd  all rights reserved  
 home telework and household commuting patterns in great britain this study provides new evidence on the relationship between household and intra household commuting travel and home telework for great britain using data from the national travel survey for the period between 2005 and 2012  the results from the empirical models of individual and household commuting travel suggest there is some evidence of longer weekly commuting distances travelled  but shorter total travel times  for more frequent home teleworkers  the findings also suggest that there is no intra household compensation effect between partners  that is  the home teleworking status of one of the household s members does not appear to influence his her partner s commuting travel  we also find that some of the observed differences relate to the definition of home teleworker status  particularly with respect to the level of home telework frequency  despite the increase in the share of workers using home telework at least once a week  from 4  in 2005 to 6  in 2012  the magnitude of the relationship between home teleworking and weekly commuting length and duration does not seem to have changed over the period studied  although the findings suggest that home telework tends to increase weekly commuting distances travelled  but not travel times   data related limitations did not allow us to address issues of selection and or simultaneity bias  consequently we cannot make causal inference conclusions about the nature and size of the relationship between home telework and commuting patterns  and in turn its policy implications   c  2017 elsevier ltd  all rights reserved  
 how bicycle level of traffic stress correlate with reported cyclist accidents injury severities  a geospatial and mixed logit analysis transportation agencies need efficient methods to determine how to reduce bicycle accidents while promoting cycling activities and prioritizing safety improvement investments  many studies have used standalone methods  such as level of traffic stress  lts  and bicycle level of service  blos   to better understand bicycle mode share and network connectivity for a region  however  in most cases  other studies rely on crash severity models to explain what variables contribute to the severity of bicycle related crashes  this research uniquely correlates bicycle lts with reported bicycle crash locations for four cities in new hampshire through geospatial mapping  lts measurements and crash locations are compared visually using a gis framework  next  a bicycle injury severity model  that incorporates lts measurements  is created through a mixed logit modeling framework  results of the visual analysis show some geospatial correlation between higher lts roads and  injury  type bicycle crashes  it was determined  statistically  that lts has an effect on the severity level of bicycle crashes and high lts can have varying effects on severity outcome  however  it is recommended that further analyses be conducted to better understand the statistical significance and effect of lts on injury severity  as such  this research will validate the use of lts as a proxy for safety risk regardless of the recorded bicycle crash history  this research will help identify the clustering patterns of bicycle crashes on high risk corridors and  therefore  assist with bicycle route planning and policy making  this paper also suggests low cost countermeasures or treatments that can be implemented to address high risk areas  specifically  with the goal of providing safer routes for cyclists  such countermeasures or treatments have the potential to substantially reduce the number of fatalities and severe injuries  
 how bicycling sharing system usage is affected by land use and urban form  analysis from system and user perspectives there is a rapid growth of bicycle sharing systems  bss  around the world  cities are supporting these systems as a more sustainable transport mode for short trips  given the relatively recent adoption of bss  there is substantial interest in understanding how these systems impact urban transportation  in this paper  we examine the functioning of the hugely successful new york city citibike system  we focus on the interaction of bss with land use and built environment attributes and the influence of weather condition and temporal characteristics on bss usage  towards this end  citibike system is analyzed along two dimensions   1  at the system level  we examine the hourly station level arrival and departure rates using a linear mixed model and  2  at the trip level  we investigate users  destination station choice preferences after they pick up a bicycle from a station employing a random utility maximization approach  the results highlight clear spatial and temporal differences in the usage of citibike by users with annual membership and users with temporary passes  overall  our analysis provides a framework and useful insights for cities that are planning to install a new bicycle sharing system or to expand an existing system  
 how can cyclist injuries be included in health impact economic assessments  this paper discusses how injuries sustained while cycling can be included as a component of health impact economic assessment of increased cycling  to include injuries as a component of a health impact assessment  their expected frequency of occurrence and impacts on health must well known  in this respect  incomplete reporting of cyclist injuries in official accident statistics is an obstacle for good health impact assessment  it is convenient to represent injuries in terms of an expected loss of health per cyclist or kilometre cycled  which can be converted to monetary terms to make it comparable with the health benefits  it is suggested that stating health loss in terms of dalys  disability adjusted life years  is suitable for this purpose  examples are given of how to estimate the health loss associated with bicycle injuries  it is more difficult to model the probability of injury  two approaches are compared  one approach relies on the relationship between distance cycled per year and risk of injury  the other approach is based on the concept of safety in numbers  the number of injuries is modelled as a function of the number of cyclists and motor vehicles  results are found to be greatly influenced by the assumptions made about whether increased cycling occurs as a result of modal shift from motor vehicles or not  
 how can the taxi industry survive the tide of ridesourcing  evidence from shenzhen  china this paper aims to examine the impact of ridesourcing on the taxi industry and explore where  when and how taxis can compete more effectively  to this end a large taxi gps trajectory data set collected in shenzhen  china is mined and more than 2 700 taxis  or about 18  of all registered in the city  are tracked in a period of three years  from january 2013 to november 2015  when both e hailing and ridesourcing were rapidly spreading in the city  the long sequence of gps data points is first broken into separate  trips   each corresponding to a unique passenger state  an origin destination zone  and a starting ending time  by examining the trip statistics  we found that   1  the taxi industry in shenzhen has experienced a significant loss in its ridership that can be indisputably credited to the competition from ridesourcing  yet  the evidence is also strong that the shock was relatively short and that the loss of the taxi industry had begun to stabilize since the second half of 2015   2  taxis are found to compete more effectively with ridesourcing in peak period  6 10 am  5 8 pm  and in areas with high population density   3  e hailing helps lift the capacity utilization rate of taxis  yet  the gains are generally modest except for the off peak period  and excessive competition can lead to severely under utilized capacities  and  4  ridesourcing worsens congestion for taxis in the city  but the impact was relatively mild  we conclude that a dedicated service fleet with exclusive street hailing access will continue to co exist with ridesourcing and that regulations are needed to ensure this market operate properly   c  2017 elsevier ltd  all rights reserved  
 how dangerous is cycling in new zealand  we compared the injury risks of typical exposures to road cycling for transport with other common activities including do it yourself repairs  diy  at home  horse riding  quad bike riding  rugby union and snow sports in new zealand  cycling on the road half an hour three times a week was similar to diy twice a month and safer than horse riding 1 5 h twice a week  5 fold difference in injury claims   skiing half a day for 4 5 times per year  140 fold   and playing rugby once every 3 weeks  530 fold difference   in statistical terms  based on moderate injuries  cycling is less dangerous than many recreational and every day activities  we conclude that fear of cycling in car dependent new zealand arises mainly from other causes than risk of injury  associated with the marginal status of cyclists on the public road   c  2017 elsevier ltd all rights reserved  
 how did the economic recession  2008 2010  influence traffic fatalities in oecd countries  this paper presents analyses of how the economic recession that started in 2008 has influenced the number of traffic fatalities in oecd countries  previous studies of the relationship between economic recessions and changes in the number of traffic fatalities are reviewed  based on these studies  a causal diagram of the relationship between changes of the business cycle and changes in the number of traffic fatalities is proposed  this causal model is tested empirically by means of multivariate analyses and analyses of accident statistics for great britain and sweden  economic recession  as indicated both by slower growth of  or decline of gross national product  and by increased unemployment is associated with an accelerated decline in the number of traffic fatalities  i e  a larger decline than the long term trend that is normal in oecd countries  the principal mechanisms bringing this about are a disproportionate reduction of driving among high risk drivers  in particular young drivers and a reduction of fatality rate per kilometre of travel  probably attributable to changes in road user behaviour that are only partly observable  the total number of vehicle kilometres of travel did not change very much as a result of the recession  the paper is based on an itf report that presents the analyses in greater detail   c  2017 elsevier ltd  all rights reserved  
 how do older adult drivers self regulate  characteristics of self regulation classes defined by latent class analysis problem  motor vehicle crashes were the second leading cause of injury death for adults aged 65 84 years in 2014  some older drivers choose to self regulate their driving to maintain mobility while reducing driving risk  yet the process remains poorly understood  methods  data from 729 older adults  aged    60 years  who joined an older adult ride service program between april 1  2010 and november 8  2013 were analyzed to define and describe classes of driving self regulation  latent class analysis was employed to characterize older adult driving self regulation classes using driving frequency and avoidance of seven driving situations  logistic regression was used to explore associations between characteristics affecting mobility and self regulation class  results  three classes were identified  low  medium  and high self regulation   high self regulating  participants reported the highest proportion of always avoiding seven risky driving situations and the lowest driving frequency followed by medium and low self regulators  those who were female  aged 80 years or older  visually impaired  assistive device users  and those with special health needs were more likely to be high self regulating compared with low self regulating  conclusions and practical applications  avoidance of certain driving situations and weekly driving frequency are valid indicators for describing driving self regulation classes in older adults  understanding the unique characteristics and mobility limitations of each class can guide optimal transportation strategies for older adults  published by elsevier ltd  on behalf of national safety council  
 how do users choose their routes in public transport  the effect of individual profile and contextual factors the aim of the present study was to better understand how public transport users make their choice of route  in order to favor the use of public transport  henceforth pt  in large cities  based on decision making theories  a classical choice paradigm  slovic  1975   and recent findings in psychology  chowdhury   ceder  2013  grison et al   2016  we developed a new method to investigate the effect of contextual and individual factors on pt route choices  we proposed to sixty pt users realistic forced choices between two pt routes that differed in affective  level of physical comfort  and instrumental  number of transport modes  attributes  we also varied the context of the decision  long or short route  route to go to work  to a leisure activity  etc    and we recorded various individual characteristics  age  sex  attitude towards pt  habits  etc    our results highlight that  the comfort of the route is preferred to the number of transport modes  especially for long trips  the choice of the comfortable alternative or the one with only one transport mode depends on user characteristics  the length of the trip and habits are the most important variables in the decision  but attitudes also seem to play a major role  our study furthers current knowledge about the psychological process of pt route choice in light with multi attribute choices theories  and provides new insights that can contribute to improving current large city route planning aids   c  2017 elsevier ltd  all rights reserved  
 how does on road fuel economy vary with vehicle cumulative mileage and daily use  understanding the fuel economy of vehicles in actual use has important implications for fuel economy  greenhouse gas emission and consumer information policies  this study explores how fuel economy varies with intensity of daily vehicle use  cumulative mileage  and ambient temperature  using a unique longitudinal database  we quantify variations in fuel economy  miles per gallon or mpg   over time for the same vehicle  the database consists of more than 600 000 odometer and fuel purchase records  obtained from the  my mpg  section of the http   fueleconomy gov website  over 10 000 drivers reported their fuel purchases and vehicle usage  with an average of 36 fill ups per vehicle  multilevel models are used to analyze and compare relationships for conventional gasoline and hybrid vehicles  for gasoline vehicles  within vehicle variation accounts for 23  total variation of fuel economy and 77  is between vehicle variation  for hybrids  the equivalent proportions are 19  and 81   on road fuel economy increases nonlinearly with cumulative mileage  with nearly all of the increase occurring within the first few thousand miles  the estimated trend for hybrid vehicles is very different from that of conventional gasoline vehicles  hybrids were found to have higher daily miles of use than conventional gasoline vehicles  cold temperatures appear to have a greater effect on the fuel economy of hybrids than conventional gasoline vehicles   c  2017 published by elsevier ltd  
 how network structure can boost and shape the demand for bus transit conventional wisdom states that transit riders are averse to transfers and that consequently bus networks should be designed to limit their number  probably as a result of this belief  many real bus systems try to connect as many origins and destinations as possible without transfers  so they are usually composed of long  circuitous routes with redundant overlapping sections   and the resulting bus map is hard to understand  if coverage is extensive  many routes are needed  economics then prevents an agency from populating all routes with sufficient buses to provide attractively frequent service  this low frequency and the complicated circuitous map discourage transfers  perpetuating the belief that people are averse to transferring  not surprisingly  the percentage of bus trips that includes a transfer has been reported to be  1 5  for boston  3  for new york  13  for london  and 16  for melbourne  the nova xarxa in barcelona was designed with a different paradigm  it was designed and deployed to cover the whole city on the belief that if a bus map is easy to understand  and has direct lines with frequent service and ubiquitous transfer points then the bus system would become more appealing  people would transfer more freely and become users of the network rather than its single lines  with this design paradigm  a city can be covered with fewer lines  which can be depicted on a simple map  the lines can in turn be economically populated with sufficient buses to deliver the high frequency required to encourage transfers  could this work  to answer this question and see whether there is truth in the beliefs underlying the new paradigm  this paper examines data from the first three deployment phases of the nova xarxa  from 2012 to 2015   it is found that the nova xarxa is already attracting more demand than the network it replaced  this attests to its appeal  furthermore  this demand has increased disproportionately with the number of lines opened for service in each phase  revealing that some people are using the nova xarxa as a network  the paper further shows that this growth is underpinned by transfers   at the end of 2015  the percentage of trips that involved a transfer was approximately 26   and it reached a maximum of 57  for line v7  these numbers should increase considerably  to 44  and 66   respectively  once the nova xarxa is completed in 2018 and passengers have even more opportunities for transferring  the numbers disprove the conventional wisdom  they strongly suggest that transit providers can attract more demand by providing transfer friendly networks that can be used as such and not as an inefficient aggregation of individual lines   c  2017 elsevier ltd  all rights reserved  
 how to define the accident risk level of car drivers by combining objective and subjective measures of driving style perceived risk can be defined as the expectation of being involved in a traffic accident  traffic risk perception is often subjectively evaluated being risk perception as highly individual  and depending on experiences with accidents  for this reason  a subjective measure of risk level can be useful  on the other hand  accident risk level can be measured also through objective measures  consisting in kinematic parameters defining the driving style  at this aim  it is very important to analyse instantaneous and geo referenced travelling kinematic parameters of the vehicle recorded by real tests on the road  the aim of this paper is to identify the accident risk level of each driver based on a methodology combining both subjective and objective parameters  specifically  by using the proposed methodology the risk can be measured immediately by using only the kinematic parameters adopted when driving  we defined three levels of risk of being involved in a road accident  low  medium  and high risk   we retain that our research can give a contribution in terms of improvement of road safety  because the distorted perception of risk level is one of the main causes of road accidents  very often  drivers are not aware of the risk taking  therefore  it is necessary to raise the awareness of drivers to have safer driving  the proposed method can be useful for informing the driver on the level of risk he she assumes  so that he she can take the necessary precautions next time that will cover that stretch of road   c  2017 elsevier ltd  all rights reserved  
 how to mix per flight and per passenger based airport charges  the oligopoly case while airport aeronautical charges are traditionally aircraft weight related  currently an increasing share of aeronautical airport revenues is derived from passenger related charges  this paper compares the optimal mix of per passenger and per flight based  cost recovering  airport charges from the carriers  and the social viewpoints when carrier markets are oligopolistic  we show that positive per passenger charges might be able to support the implementation of monopoly fares at slot constrained airports  they can also mitigate strategic frequency reductions at uncongested airports  leading to an increase in both carrier profit and welfare relative to a charging scheme that fully relies on per flight charges   c  2017 elsevier ltd  all rights reserved  
 how to support the design and evaluation of redevelopment projects for disused railways  a methodological proposal and key lessons learned finding a new use for neglected infrastructures  such as disused railways  provides an opportunity for low carbon travel experiences as reconversion policies promote new uses  arrest decay processes and re establish continuity in the environmental system  using existing linear infrastructures  nevertheless  the decision of what to do in order to reuse abandoned railways represents a complex decision making problem  involving heterogeneous impacts and stakeholders  within this context  multi criteria analysis techniques can be used to synthesize stakeholders  preferences by accommodating conflicting and incommensurable impacts  the present study thus uses multi criteria analysis to answer a real demand for transportation systems  planning coming from the piedmont region authority in italy  where 12 passenger railway lines have recently been abandoned and replaced by bus services  the main objective of the study is to develop a methodological framework able to support collaborative planning and decision making processes related to the requalification of disused railways in mixed urban and rural contexts  the ultimate objective is to provide a robust recommendation to the regional authority with reference to the best requalification option for one of the abandoned railway lines in the region  the contribution brought by the study is twofold and refers to   i  improved operability of the proposed tools obtained by combining visualization analytics with consolidated preference elicitation protocols for assessing multiple impacts and  ii  the provision of a replicable working tool for policy makers  the study has thus an innovative value and may increase the use of decision analytics to support the evaluation of environmental impacts of different transportation systems   c  2017 elsevier ltd  all rights reserved  
 hub airport congestion pricing and capacity investment this study examines hub airport congestion pricing and capacity investment using a simple hub spoke network model  in which hub carrier scheduling causes both schedule delays and congestion delays  the  fixed proportion assumption  is removed  we find the following   i  a public hub airport requires both per flight charges  which must be movement related but cannot be weight related  and discriminatory per local and per connecting passenger charges to reach the first best outcome   ii  either weight related per flight charges or the marginal operating cost  moc  pricing on local and or connecting passengers cannot reach the first best   iii  first best charges can lead capacity investment to be socially efficient  however  weight related per flights charges result in under investment  whereas the moc pricing results in over investment in runway capacity   iv  private hubs that charge positive movement related per flight charges subsidize passengers through per passenger charges  finally   v  movement related per flight charges lead private hubs to overinvest  whereas weight related per flight charges lead to either over  or under investment   c  2017 elsevier ltd  all rights reserved  
 i can t believe your attitude  a joint estimation of best worst attitudes and electric vehicle choice the number of conventionally fuelled motor vehicles in use is increasing worldwide despite warnings about finite fossil fuel and the detrimental impacts of burning such fuels  while electric vehicles  the subject of much research  generate far less emissions and offer the potential for power from renewable sources  they are yet to significantly penetrate the market  tangible barriers such as price and vehicle range still exist  but consumer attitudes also drive behaviour  this paper examines attributes in a framework relatively new to transportation and energy policy  best worst scaling  this method is widely considered an improvement over traditional methods of eliciting attitudes and beliefs  where respondents select attitudes they find best or worst from a set of attitudinal statements  to avoid potential endogeneity bias  we jointly model attitudes and choice for the first time with best worst data  it is found that energy crisis  air quality and climate change concerns influence behaviour with respect to vehicle range and that travel behaviour change and forms of government incentives are needed influences on behaviour with respect to vehicle emissions  it is argued that correctly modelling attitudes reduces the error term of the vehicle choice model and provides policy makers with an improved lens for assessing behaviour  additionally  the methods described within can easily be adapted to other policy scenarios  
 i m multimodal  aren t you  how ego centric anchoring biases experts  perceptions of travel patterns transport professional process an enormous range of information to help them accurately predict how  when and where people will use the transport system  yet we know from a long standing history of psychology research that people draw upon a range of mental shortcuts when making estimates about the world  ego centric anchoring and adjustment is a common example of a mental heuristic whereby people draw upon their own beliefs and experiences when estimating the behaviors and attitudes of others  do transport professionals use ego centric anchoring when estimating travel patterns  to find out we conducted a survey of transportation professionals  n   247  who were asked to reveal their own travel patterns and residential location and to estimate the travel patterns of millennials  generation x  and baby boomers  we find that relative to the average american  transportation professionals in the us are more likely to use alternative transport modes and live in more urban neighborhoods  transportation professionals systematically over estimate the use of alternative modes  and under estimate driving  among other americans  this effect is strongest among transportation professionals who themselves are multi modal  these results raise a note of caution for transport practitioners and policy makers to be aware of one s initial  anchor  of personal experience when judging the behavior and desires of the community  for example if practitioners overestimate the proportion of americans that are already walking  biking  and using transit  they may under estimate the policy and institutional barriers that have led the majority of americans to follow the car dominated path of previous generations   c  2017 elsevier ltd  all rights reserved

 identification of characteristics and frequent scenarios of single vehicle rollover crashes during pre ballistic phase  part 1 a descriptive study this study aimed to identify common patterns of pre ballistic vehicle kinematics and roadway characteristics of real world rollover crashes  rollover crashes that were enrolled in the national automotive sampling systemcrashworthiness data system  nass cds  between the years 2000 and 2010 were analyzed  a descriptive analysis was performed to understand the characteristics of the pre ballistic phase  also  a frequency based pattern analysis was performed using a selection of nass cds variables describing the pre ballistic vehicle kinematics and roadway characteristics to rank common pathways of rollover crashes  most case vehicles departed the road due to a loss of control traction  loc   61    the road departure with loc was found to be 13 4 times more likely to occur with slippery road conditions compared to dry conditions  the vehicle was typically laterally skidding with yawing prior to a rollover  66    most case vehicles tripped over  82   mostly at roadside median  69    the tripping force was applied to the wheels tires  82   from the ground  79    the combination of these six most frequent attributes resulted in the most common scenario  which accounted for 26  of the entire cases  large proportion of road departure with loc  61   implies electronic stability control  esc  systems being an effective countermeasure for preventing single vehicle rollover crashes  furthermore  the correlation between the road departure with loc and the reduced friction limit suggests the necessity of the performance evaluation of esc under compromised road surface condition  
 identification of high risk metropolitan intersection sites in perth  australia as convergence points for road users approaching from multiple directions  intersections have more opportunities for conflicts  thus higher crash risk than other parts of the road network  given the limited resources available for road safety  it is important to identify high risk intersections so that they can be prioritised for infrastructure improvement  this study used a three stage approach to identify intersections in perth  western australia  using road trauma risk analysis  then comparative safety performance analysis and finally ranking the intersections by the kr  killed and serious injury  metric  these methodologies were developed by main roads western australia  crash data from 2011 to 2015 were used in the analyses  the results identify the top high risk intersections for each intersection type  by speed environment and control type   recommendations are made for extensions to this process to improve identification of high risk intersections  and the use of a taxonomy to identify candidate treatments  
 identifying destination distances that support walking trips in local neighborhoods when examining associations between local destinations and walking it is common to count local destinations using street network buffers measured at various distances to mitigate spatial data aggregation issues caused by scale and the modifiable areal unit problem  however  it remains unclear whether a particular buffer size is preferred since large buffers may mask important effects whilst small buffers may not accurately represent a neighborhood area  furthermore  the use of various buffer distances in measuring destination counts does not yield specific information on distances where destinations could be placed in order to increase levels of walking  this paper extends current methods to address these issues by using a new method to define network buffers to identify threshold distances for walking to seven destination types using multilevel models  donut buffers are introduced as a method of counting destinations between distances of 401 m 800 m and 801 m 1200 m which are compared to standard network buffers at distances of 400 m  800 m and 1200 m respectively  we found that destinations within 401 m 800 m could be responsible for associations found at a network buffer of 1200 m  specifically  the odds of walking increased when local food outlets including supermarkets  cafes takeaway stores  and small food stores  were located within 401 m 800 m but not 801 m 1200 m  suggesting that these destinations encourage walking when placed at 401 m 800 m away  consequently we argue that donut buffers offer greater specificity than standard network buffers for geographic measurement of destinations  this warrants further investigation to inform urban policy guidelines for designing walkable environments  crown copyright  c  2016 published by elsevier ltd  all rights reserved  
 identifying effects of driving and secondary task demands  passenger presence  and driver characteristics on driving errors and traffic violations   using naturalistic driving data segments preceding both safety critical events and matched baselines researchers have identified various factors that likely affect aberrant driving behaviors and therefore crash risk  however  it remains unclear which of these factors poses the greatest risk for committing either errors or violations under naturalistic driving conditions  this study investigated important variables contributing to driving errors and traffic violations based on naturalistic driving data from the second strategic highway research program  shrp 2   the analyzed driving segments preceded both safety critical events and matched baselines  results showed that intersection influence  high risk visually distracting secondary tasks  and the severities of the safety critical events were the main factors associated with driving errors  the primary factors linked to violations were intersection influence  persistent individual differences in driver behavior  and the severities of the safety critical events  furthermore  the number of aberrant driving behaviors in trip segments preceding crashes was higher than in the matched segments unrelated to safety critical events  however  the most common aberrant driving behavior types in the respective segment groups appeared to resemble each other  this suggests that crashes became more likely due to drivers committing more violations and errors overall as opposed to drivers making one certain type of error or violation   c  2017 elsevier ltd  all rights reserved  
 identifying key assumptions and differences in life cycle assessment studies of lithium ion traction batteries with focus on greenhouse gas emissions the various studies that consider the life cycle environmental impacts of lithium ion traction batteries report widely different results  this article evaluates the inventory data and results to identify the key assumptions and differences in the studies  to aid the identification  we compile the reported life cycle greenhouse gas emissions of batteries  the studies find production related emissions in the range of 38 356 kg co2 eq kw h  one of the main sources of the large variations stems from differing assumptions regarding direct energy demand associated with cell manufacture and pack assembly  further differences are due to assumptions regarding the amount of cell materials and other battery components  the indirect emissions associated with the use phase depend on the conversion losses in the battery  the energy required to transport the weight of the battery  and the carbon intensity of the electricity  of the reviewed studies assessing the use phase  all estimate energy use associated with conversion losses while only one considers the mass induced energy requirement  although there are several industrial end of life treatment alternatives for lithium ion batteries  very few studies consider this life cycle stage  studies using the  recycled content  approach report emissions in the range of 3 6 27 kg co2 eq kw h battery  while studies using the  end of life  approach report emission reductions in the range of 16 32 kg co2 eq kw h battery  the uncertainty associated with the end of life results is high as the data availability on industrial process is limited  based on our findings  we discuss how the life emissions of lithium ion traction batteries may be reduced   c  2017 elsevier ltd  all rights reserved  
 identifying reasons for historic car ownership and use and policy implications  an explorative latent class analysis the number of historic vehicles is steadily increasing  although  these vehicles are part of our cultural heritage with respect to road transport and mobility  they present  future  environmental concerns  which is a relevant development from policy perspective  yet  as far as the authors are aware  there is hardly any academic literature addressing this issue  this study aims to provide a first exploration of historic cars and reasons for ownership and use and policy implications  to this end  a large explorative survey is conducted among hv owners of 15 european countries  focusing on passenger car owners only  a latent class analysis is performed to identify possible segments among historic car owners  seven latent classes are identified  recreational owners  reserved owners  repair men  die hard fans  next generation fans  frequent drivers and collectors  overall  the results indicate that there is large diversity in the ownership and use of historic cars and the reasons behind ownership  however  in general  historic cars are used much less than modern cars  only the group of  frequent drivers   8  of the sample  represent a potential concern regarding emissions from a policy perspective  finally  policy recommendations are provided for decision makers regarding historic cars  
 identifying similar days for air traffic management air traffic managers face challenging decisions due to uncertainity in weather and air traffic  one way to support their decisions is to identify similar historical days  the traffic management actions taken on those days  and the resulting outcomes  we develop similarity measures based on quarter hourly capacity and demand data at four case study airports ewr  sfo  ord and jfk  we find that dimensionality reduction is feasible for capacity data  and base similarity on principal components  dimensionality reduction cannot be efficiently performed on demand data  consequently similarity is based on original data  we find that both capacity and demand data lack natural clusters and propose a continuous similarity measure  finally  we estimate overall capacity and demand similarities  which are visualized using metric multidimensional scaling plots  we observe that most days with air traffic management activity are similar to certain other days  validating the potential of this approach for decision support   c  2017 elsevier ltd  all rights reserved  
 identifying the main factors contributing to driving errors and traffic violations   results from naturalistic driving data researchers have identified various factors that likely affect aberrant driving behaviors and therefore crash risk  however  it remains unclear which of these factors poses the greatest risk for either errors or violations under naturalistic driving conditions  this study investigated important variables contributing to driving errors and traffic violations based on naturalistic driving data from the second strategic highway research program  shrp 2   in addition  this study identified factors determining the drivers  willingness to perform common secondary tasks while driving  which have been associated with different degrees of crash risk  results showed that anger  passenger presence  and persistent individual differences in driver behavior were the main factors associated with committed violations  surprise  high risk visually distracting secondary tasks  and the driving task demand passing through an interchange were the main factors associated with errors  the willingness to engage in risky secondary tasks while driving appeared to be related to an overall tendency to engage in risky driving behaviors  however  drivers considered the driving context particularly when engaging in visually distracting secondary tasks  this study s comprehensive approach should be a step towards generating a complete model of the variables that contribute to  or mitigate dangers in traffic   c  2017 elsevier ltd  all rights reserved  
 identifying  creating  and testing urban planning measures for transport walking  findings from the australian national liveability study a vast body of research demonstrates that living in  more walkable  neighbourhoods is associated with increased walking  and in turn  positively impacts selected health behaviours and outcomes  yet  walkable neighbourhoods are not always delivered  the aims of this study were to identify australian urban planning policies designed to foster  walk ability   and to test measures based on these policies with transport walking behaviours in adults  overall  14 australian state level urban planning policies related to walking were identified  spatial measures were developed based on these urban planning policies  and linked with geocoded population survey data  associations between the urban planning spatial measures and neighbourhood transport walking behaviours were tested in a sample of urban adults  n 16 890   the odds of transport walking were significantly higher for those living in  more walkable   compared with less walkable  neighbourhoods  i e  with more connected street networks  higher residential densities  more destinations available  and shorter block sizes and distances to activity centres  our findings showed that all 14 policies implemented in gis were independently associated with walking in the residential neighbourhood  the associations observed tended to be stronger than previously shown  especially in regard to the dwelling density and daily destination measures  our findings support the calls for more research using policy relevant measures in order to better inform urban planning guidance  and suggests that if current spatially derived urban policies were implemented  it may increase transport walking  this research has the potential to contribute to building consensus for urban planning policies related to walking   c  2016 elsevier ltd all rights reserved  
 imagined people  behaviour and future mobility  insights from visions of electric vehicles and car clubs in the united kingdom this study focuses on imagined futures of personal mobility in the united kingdom in the context of the need to reduce greenhouse gas emissions from transport  focusing on two innovations  electric vehicles and car clubs  the study investigates how people  behaviour and mobility are imagined in a range of visioning documents about the future up to 2050  a timeline that is critically important for emission reduction targets  we find that people are imagined primarily as consumers in line with the rational actor paradigm  with many visions focusing on low carbon vehicles as a sustainability solution  this simple technological substitution vision does not play to the strengths of electric vehicles  and diminishes their transformative potential  there are fewer car club visions  these show less car ownership  but retain high mobility and an economic growth perspective  our findings support the idea that much future mobility visioning is used to support the status quo  rather than to explore a variety of futures with diverse portrayal of people  behaviour and mobility  
 impact of driving behavior on traffic delay at a congested signalized intersection this paper proposes a methodology to categorize drivers  behaviors at a congested signalized intersection  as a discrete event system model  timed petri nets  tpns  are used in this paper to formally define two kinds of behaviors  non jam induced driving behavior and jam induced one  in order to systematically assess the performances of both behaviors  a new urban traffic network model is built  a cell transmission model is used to depict the road link traffic that is consistent with the kinematic property of traffic flow  and tpns are used to model the behaviors and the conflicting traffic flow at the intersection  some simulation results are given to evaluate the impact of driving behavior on the traffic delay  
 impact of driving style and road grade on gaseous exhaust emissions of passenger vehicles measured by a portable emission measurement system  pems  motivated by the upcoming euro 6c regulation including real driving emissions  rde   the present study addresses the impact of different driving styles and route characteristics on on road exhaust emissions  gaseous emissions of two diesel test vehicles  euro 5 and euro 6  were measured using a portable emission measurement system  pems  on an rde compliant test route  the driving parameters relative positive acceleration  rpa   mean positive acceleration  mpa  and v  apos95 allowed a favorable classification of different driving styles  the comparison of driving parameters for normal pems trips with reference data obtained from the world harmonized light duty test cycle  wltc  and from field operational tests  fot  indicated a good representation of normal driving  severe driving led to elevated co2 and no  emissions as compared to normal trips while co and hc did not allow a distinct classification of different driving styles  route characteristics of four different routes were investigated applying the parameter cumulated altitude gain using google elevation data  the distance specific no  emissions were in the same range for trips with comparable driving dynamics on routes with similar cumulated altitude gain  based on repetitive measurements the road grade was calculated within 100 m segments  co2 and no  emissions measured by a pems showed a linear increase with road grade  larger emissions at higher road grades could be explained by more frequent high engine load points  in this study cumulated altitude gain and road grade were directly correlated to emissions measured by the pems and the step from 0 to 5  road grade led to a co2 increase of 65 81  and a no  increase of 85 115    c  2017 elsevier ltd  all rights reserved  
 impact of helmet use on traumatic brain injury from road traffic accidents in cambodia objective  rapid urbanization and motorization without corresponding increases in helmet usage have made traumatic brain injury due to road traffic accidents a major public health crisis in cambodia  this analysis was conducted to quantify the impact of helmets on severity of injury  neurosurgical indication  and functional outcomes at discharge for motorcycle operators who required hospitalization for a traumatic brain injury following a road traffic accident in cambodia methods  the medical records of 491 motorcycle operators who presented to a major tertiary care center in cambodia with traumatic brain injury were retrospectively analyzed using multivariate logistic regression results  the most common injuries at presentation were contusions  47 0    epidural hematomas  30 1    subdural hematomas  27 9    subarachnoid hemorrhages  12 4    skull fractures  21 4    and facial fractures  18 5    moderate to severe loss of consciousness was present in 36 3  of patients  not wearing a helmet was associated with an odds ratio of 2 20  95  confidence interval  ci   1 15 4 22  for presenting with moderate to severe loss of consciousness compared to helmeted patients  craniotomy or craniectomy was indicated for evacuation of hematoma in 20 0  of cases  and nonhelmeted patients had 3 21 fold higher odds of requiring neurosurgical intervention  95  ci  1 25 8 27   furthermore  lack of helmet usage was associated with 2 72 fold higher odds of discharge with functional deficits  95  ci  1 14 6 49   in total  30 1  of patients were discharged with severe functional deficits conclusions  helmets demonstrate a protective effect and may be an effective public health intervention to significantly reduce the burden of traumatic brain injury in cambodia and other developing countries with increasing rates of motorization across the world  
 impact of in vehicle navigation information on lane change behavior in urban expressway diverge segments lane changing behaviors frequently occur at upstream of the urban expressway off ramp  which possibly cause bottleneck or accident  this paper studies how in vehicle navigation information impacts lane changing behavior at this urban expressway diverge segments with comparison to the traditional road signs by conducting a series of driving simulator experiments  in consideration of variation of the first provision time point and traffic flow density  firstly  the driving simulator is validated by comparing data of lane changing position and merging gap from both field survey and simulator  then comparison study was performed for twelve scenarios which comprise four information provision design schemes under three different traffic flow density status  lane changing characteristics are analyzed by selecting six indicators  which are lane changing merging gap  lane changing position  lane change delay  lane changing steering angle  lane changing deceleration  and the safe distance of lane changing  the results show that the impact of in vehicle navigation information on lane changing behavior varies with traffic flow density and the time point of the first navigation information provided  the in vehicle navigation information had significant positive impact on lane changing safety under medium to high density condition  however  the effect is not significant under light density condition  moreover  more improvement in operational safety and smooth could be gained when the in vehicle navigation information is provided earlier within range of 2 km upstream of the exit gore  
 impact of individual resilience and safety climate on safety performance and psychological stress of construction workers  a case study of the ontario construction industry introduction  the construction industry has hit a plateau in terms of safety performance  safety climate is regarded as a leading indicator of safety performance  however  relatively little safety climate research has been done in the canadian construction industry  safety climate may be geographically sensitive  thus it is necessary to examine how the construct of safety climate is defined and used to improve safety performance in different regions  on the other hand  more and more attention has been paid to job related stress in the construction industry  previous research proposed that individual resilience may be associated with a better safety performance and may help employees manage stress  unfortunately  few empirical research studies have examined this hypothesis  this paper aims to examine the role of safety climate and individual resilience in safety performance and job stress in the canadian construction industry  method  the research was based on 837 surveys collected in ontario between june 2015 and june 2016  structural equation modeling  sem  techniques were used to explore the impact of individual resilience and safety climate on physical safety outcomes and on psychological stress among construction workers  results  the results show that safety climate not only affected construction workers  safety performance but also indirectly affected their psychological stress  in addition  it was found that individual resilience had a direct negative impact on psychological stress but had no impact on physical safety outcomes  conclusions  these findings highlight the roles of both organizational and individual factors in individual safety performance and in psychological well being  practical applications  construction organizations need to not only monitor employees  safety performance  but also to assess their employees  psychological well being  promoting a positive safety climate together with developing training programs focusing on improving employees  psychological health especially post trauma psychological health can improve the safety performance of an organization   c  2017 the authors  published by elsevier ltd on behalf of national safety council  
 impact of on board tutoring systems to improve driving efficiency of non professional drivers efficient driving has been positioned as the most popular alternative to reduce air pollution and obtain fuel savings  however  efficient driving requires a continuous learning process in order to prevent users reverting to their original habits  to facilitate the learning process  on board tutoring systems have appeared  in this study  the authors analyse in detail the impact of two types of such eco feedback devices on driver s behaviour  the evaluated tutoring systems include information related to the optimal engaged gear  but also related to other safety and comfort parameters  their analysis is based on one of the largest and heterogeneous population groups of non professional drivers who have participated in experiments with feedback devices specifically designed to achieve more efficient driving  a total number of 158 volunteers participated in the experiments covering periods of time between 3 and 11 months and using the feedback devices during their daily routine  results show that  in general  users evolve positively following the eco driving recommendations throughout the duration of the experiments  in addition  there are significant differences in the use of the tutoring system depending on the type of route  the time of day and other factors such as age or gender

 impact of roadway characteristics on bicycle safety bicyclists are vulnerable road users who are at greater risk for fatal or serious injury when involved in a crash with a motor vehicle  while bicycling accounts for only 1  percent of all trips taken in the united states  bicycle fatalities constitute over 2 percent of all traffic fatalities  1 it is thus not surprising that bicyclists  along with other vulnerable road users  are identified as one of the eight emphasis areas in the florida s 2012 strategic highway safety plan  shsp   2  in 2014  florida led the nation with 139 bicyclist fatalities  representing approximately 20 percent of the nation s total  from 2011 to 2014 the number of fatal and serious injury crashes involving a bicyclist increased by 30 percent and reported crashes increased by 44 percent  thus  more strategic approaches in identifying effective countermeasures to reduce bicycle crashes are of great interest to transportation agencies and the public at large  
 impact of the built environment on the vehicle emission effects of road pricing policies  a simulation case study in order to develop a road pricing policy that is effective in reducing vehicle emissions  this paper explores the relationship between road pricing  the urban built environment  and vehicle emissions  existing studies generally tend to choose a city or an entire region as the research object  for this reason  these kinds of studies can neither analyze the differences in the vehicle emission effects of road charging on regions with different built environment attributes  nor distinguish how different built environment attributes affect the vehicle emission effects of road user charging  to fill in the research gap  this paper focuses on the influences of road charging on the vehicle emissions of regions with different built environment characteristics  in order to achieve the above mentioned goal  this paper first applies a method which combines the land use and transport interaction model with a vehicle emission model to simulate the automobile emissions under different road pricing schemes  then  using multiple regression analysis  this paper establishes the association between the built environment attributes and the vehicle emissions under different road charging levels  additionally  using factor analysis and cluster analysis  this research further distinguishes the vehicle emission effects of road pricing based on attributes of the built environment  the results confirmed that road pricing affects vehicle emissions in different regions differently  more importantly  not every region will experience decreases in vehicle emissions after the implementation of a road charging policy  the presence of retail amenities  good street design  and public transportation  the more significant the effect of road pricing in reducing vehicle emissions  furthermore  a healthy jobs housing balance is also conducive to the decline of regional automobile emissions as well   c  2017 elsevier ltd  all rights reserved

 incorporating ethical considerations into automated vehicle control not only do automated vehicles need to meet specifications for technical performance  they also need to satisfy the societal expectations for behavior in traffic with humans  societal expectations  such as accident avoidance and adherence to traffic laws  have their foundation in core moral issues found in philosophy and ethics  thus  engineers designing control algorithms for automated vehicles can benefit from applying principles and frameworks from philosophy to drive design decisions  in particular  we use a set of ethical frameworks to map design decisions for a model predictive control problem to philosophical principles  deontology  a rule based ethical framework  motivates the development of constraints on the system  consequentialism  a cost based ethical framework  motivates the construction of the objective function  the choice of weights is guided by the concepts of virtue ethics and role morality to determine behavior for different types of vehicles  the strong link between ethical principles and actual vehicle behavior developed through this approach is demonstrated experimentally by implementing alternative design choices on a test vehicle in a simple driving scenario  
 incorporating in home activities in adapts activity based framework  a sequential conditional probability approach in travel demand modelling literature  minor attention has been given to modelling and specifically micro simulating the in home activities  one reason could be associated with the fact that in home activities do not explicitly involve trips  besides  data limitation could be another reason since most of the travel surveys are based on the household travel diary approach and do not encompass in home activity information  nonetheless  incorporating people s in home activities into the activity based travel demand frameworks and perceiving the associations between the activities people perform in home and out of home could enhance the activity generation  planning  and scheduling procedures  in an effort to analyze such associations  this study uses a sequential conditional probability approach for modelling activity type and duration decisions of in home activities in conjunction with out of home ones  the paper first proposes an algorithm to incorporate in home activities within the agent based activity planning and travel scheduling  adapts  framework  then  models regarding generation and planning of in home activities are presented and described accordingly  the new framework is capable of modelling and simulating in home activities alongside and in conjunction with out of home activities with a special focus on a large set of in home activity types  
 incorporating psycho physical mapping into random regret choice models  model specifications and empirical performance assessments recently  regret based choice models have been introduced in the travel behavior research community as an alternative to expected random utility models  the fundamental proposition of regret theory is that individuals minimize the amount of regret they  are expected to  experience when choosing among choice alternatives  in this context  regret is defined as a function of attribute differences between the considered choice alternative and one or more foregone choice alternatives in an individual s choice set  this definition of regret as a function of physical attributes of the choice alternatives implies that current regret based choice models do not account for the perception of attributes  which is likely related to their magnitude  therefore  in this paper  we propose and empirically test such an elaboration of the basic regret minimization models  the current paper sets out to formulate random regret minimization models that incorporate a non linear representation of the perception of attribute levels  inspired by long standing research on psycho physical measurement  it is assumed that the perception of stimuli  attributes  is proportional to their magnitude  to allow for slight deviations from this representation  a more general non linear psycho physical representation of the relationship between attribute levels and their perception is also tested  the suggested models are tested using two data sets  one data set concerned the stated choice of shopping centre  the other concerned revealed preference of mode choice  the two newly formulated regret models are compared against each other and against their original random regret minimization base specifications  in addition to comparing the predictive performance of these model specifications  validation tests are conducted  in each case study  the newly suggested regret models  incorporating a non linear representation of perception  achieve significant improvements in goodness of fit over the original regret formulations  the results of the k fold validation tests provide further support to this finding

 indifference bands for boundedly rational route switching the replacement i 35w bridge in minneapolis saw less traffic than the original bridge though it provided substantial travel time saving for many travelers  this observation cannot be explained by the classical route choice assumption that travelers always take the shortest path  accordingly  a boundedly rational route switching model is proposed assuming that travelers will not switch to the new bridge unless travel time saving goes beyond a threshold or  indifference band   indifference bands are assumed to follow lognormal distribution and are estimated in two specifications  the first one assumes every driver s indifference band is drawn from a population indifference band and the second one assumes that the mean of drivers  indifference bands is a function of their own characteristics  route choices of 78 subjects from a gps travel behavior study were analyzed before and after the addition of the new i 35w bridge to estimate parameters  this study provides insights into empirical analysis of bounded rationality and sheds light on indifference band estimation using empirical data

 influence of pedestrian age and gender on spatial and temporal distribution of pedestrian crashes objectives  every year  about 1 24 million people are killed in traffic crashes worldwide and more than 22  of these deaths are pedestrians  therefore  pedestrian safety has become a significant traffic safety issue worldwide  in order to develop effective and targeted safety programs  the location  and time specific influences on vehicle pedestrian crashes must be assessed  the main purpose of this research is to explore the influence of pedestrian age and gender on the temporal and spatial distribution of vehicle pedestrian crashes to identify the hotspots and hot times methods  data for all vehicle pedestrian crashes on public roadways in the melbourne metropolitan area from 2004 to 2013 are used in this research  spatial autocorrelation is applied in examining the vehicle pedestrian crashes in geographic information systems  gis  to identify any dependency between time and location of these crashes  spider plots and kernel density estimation  kde  are then used to determine the temporal and spatial patterns of vehicle pedestrian crashes for different age groups and genders results  temporal analysis shows that pedestrian age has a significant influence on the temporal distribution of vehicle pedestrian crashes  furthermore  men and women have different crash patterns  in addition  results of the spatial analysis shows that areas with high risk of vehicle pedestrian crashes can vary during different times of the day for different age groups and genders  for example  for those between ages 18 and 65  most vehicle pedestrian crashes occur in the central business district  cbd  during the day  but between 7 00 p m  and 6 00a m   crashes among this age group occur mostly around hotels  clubs  and bars conclusions  this research reveals that temporal and spatial distributions of vehicle pedestrian crashes vary for different pedestrian age groups and genders  therefore  specific safety measures should be in place during high crash times at different locations for different age groups and genders to increase the effectiveness of the countermeasures in preventing and reducing vehicle pedestrian crashes  
 informality and accessibility to jobs by public transit  evidence from the sao paulo metropolitan region access to opportunities through public transport can have different impacts on individual s life especially in developing countries where opportunities are limited  job informality rates are high  and socioeconomic characteristics gaps are big  the aim of this paper is to explore the relationship between job informality and accessibility to employment by public transport in sao paulo metropolitan region  spmr   brazil  to do so  we calculate a cumulative opportunity measure of accessibility to jobs for 633 areas within the spmr  we use a multilevel mixed effects logistic regression model to estimate the effect of job accessibility on the likelihood of being informally employed  controlling for individual and other area characteristics  to account for informal sector heterogeneity  two regression models are generated  one for the workers earning below minimum wage and one for the workers earning above minimum wage  the results show that accessibility to jobs is unevenly distributed across the region  largely concentrated in the core of the region  and especially in the high income areas  the regression results show that for workers earning less than the minimum wage  a higher level of accessibility to jobs by public transport is associated with a lower likelihood of being a worker in the informal job sector  for informal workers earning more than the minimum wage  car ownership seem to be more relevant than transit accessibility in determining the likelihood of being part of the informal job sector  in light of these findings  increasing accessibility by public transport through either expanding transit services to areas with high informality rates to have a better access to formal jobs or supporting the decentralization of formal jobs may be a way to achieve reductions in informality rates  especially among those earning less than the minimum wage  
 information for travelling  awareness and usage of the various sources of information available to public transport users in nsw public transport authorities and service providers place great emphasis on information provision to travellers both before and during travel  information provided prior to travel has included printed timetables  newspaper advertisements  telephone services and marketing campaigns  during the trip  providers have tended to offer maps at public transport stops  i e  bus stops  train stations  ferry wharves  etc   as well as timetables static  dynamic or real time  some of these channels are still used but improvements in digital technology has led to a wider range of information distributed using different digital media  whilst transport for nsw and transport operators continue to provide the more traditional information  there has been a plethora of third party applications which are accessible on the move  the literature recognises that the need for information and the importance of information provision differs at the various stages of the trip  from planning  to entry into the system  to wayfinding during the trip and egress from the system  however  no systematic research exists as to how information preferences and usage differ between customer segments  it is important for operators and regulators to identify the segments and their information preferences so as to promote public transport use  this paper addresses this important issue by presenting the results of an internet survey of the public s awareness and usage of public transport information  focussing on commuters  the paper looks at awareness and usage of information sources and how this varies by stage of journey and frequency of usage of public transport  factor analysis is used to identify segments of customers by attitudes towards public transport and usage of information sources  the paper uses an ordered choice modelling approach and finds few differences between frequent and infrequent users but confirmed the role of attitudes in framing the respondent s identification of their satisfaction with the overall public transport trip and with the information sources provided  the paper also identifies the importance of recognising the non homogeneity of information sources  the paper concludes how the type of information preferred by travellers varies by public transport mode and varies by trip segment   c  2017 elsevier ltd  all rights reserved  
 injunctive safety norms  young worker risk taking behaviors  and workplace injuries injunctive safety norms  isns  refer to perceptions of others  expectations of one s safety related conduct  drawing on a sample of canadian young workers  n   11 986  m age   17 90 years  55  males   we study the relationships among four sources of non work related  i e   parents  siblings  friends  teachers   two sources of work related  i e   supervisors  co workers  isns  young workers  self reported work related risk taking behaviors  and workplace injuries  structural equation modeling suggests that isns from parents  supervisors  and co workers were related to less frequent work related risk taking behaviors  and with fewer workplace injuries via less frequent work related risk taking behaviors  in addition  isns from supervisors were directly associated with fewer workplace injuries  in contrast  isns from teachers and siblings were not associated with work related risk taking behaviors  but isns from siblings were associated with fewer work injuries  finally  isns from friends were associated with more frequent work related risk taking and more frequent work injuries via more frequent work related risk taking  this study draws attention to the relative roles of non work sources of social influence and provides some evidence of how isns might be related to young workers  work related risk taking behaviors and their workplace injuries  it also contributes to practice by suggesting specific interventions that parents  supervisors  and co workers could undertake to reduce young workers  work related risk taking and workplace injuries  namely encouraging youth to be safe at work  
 insights into targeting young male drivers with anti speeding advertising  an application of the step approach to message design and testing  satmdt  in australia  young drivers aged 17 25 years comprise 13  of the population yet account for 22  of all road deaths with young males over represented in such trauma  speeding represents a major contributing factor and advertising campaigns have long focused on promoting anti speeding messages in the effort to reduce drivers  speeds  positioned within a larger program of research aimed at developing  piloting  and evaluating a range of theoretically informed anti speeding messages  the current study reports results relating to the final phase of the research  the evaluation  six messages were devised in accordance with the guiding framework  the step approach to message design and testing   satmdt   lewis et al   2016  and based on the findings emerging from earlier qualitative and quantitative studies within the program of research  n   938 licensed drivers  n   455 males  48   aged 17 62 years completed an online survey  to ensure a controlled test of the persuasiveness of the message content  the messages were presented in an audio based format and thus were devoid of potential confounds  such as images  the messages sought to address a particular belief  i e   behavioural  normative  control  and to focus either on emphasising the positive aspects which make speeding less likely or challenging the negative aspects which make speeding more likely  thus  key to this evaluation was to test the persuasiveness of the message content in terms of the particular belief and focus it was addressing  participants were randomly assigned to either the control condition  i e   no exposure to a message  or the intervention condition  i e   exposed to one of the six messages presented as an audio recorded message within the survey   persuasiveness was assessed via a range of outcome measures including both direct  i e   third person perceptions  message rejection  as well as indirect measures  i e   intentions  willingness to speed   age  gender  and message type were independent variables  ivs   together with issue involvement as a covariate  or iv  in the study s analyses  overall  positive persuasive effects  and a relative absence of any negative  dissuasive effects  were found for two messages  glass cars and the lift  these messages addressed the same salient belief  control beliefs  with the former emphasising the factors which discourage speeding and the latter message challenging those factors which encourage speeding  the implications of the findings are discussed in terms of the insights they offer for the key content of future anti speeding messages  
 integrated airline planning  robust update of scheduling and fleet balancing under demand uncertainty the airline schedule planning problem is defined as the sequence of decisions that need to be made to obtain a fully operational flight schedule  historically  the airline scheduling problem has been sequentially solved  however  there have already been many attempts in order to obtain airline schedules in an integrated way  but due to tractability issues it is nowadays impossible to determine a fully operative and optimal schedule with an integrated model which accounts for all the key airline related aspects such as competitive effects  stochastic demand figures and uncertain operating conditions  airlines usually develop base schedules  which are obtained much time in advance to the day of operations and not accounting for all the related uncertainty  this paper proposes a mathematical model in order to update base schedules in terms of timetable and fleet assignments while considering stochastic demand figures and uncertain operating conditions  and where robust itineraries are introduced in order to ameliorate miss connected passengers  the proposed model leads to a large scale problem which is difficult to be solved  therefore  a novel improved and accelerated benders decomposition approach is proposed  the analytical work is supported with case studies involving the spanish legacy airline  iberia  the presented approach shows that the number of miss connected passengers may be reduced when robust planning is applied   c  2017 elsevier ltd  all rights reserved  
 integrated cooperative adaptive cruise and variable speed limit controls for reducing rear end collision risks near freeway bottlenecks based on micro simulations freeway bottlenecks lead to traffic congestion and speed reduction  resulting in increased risks of rear end collision  this paper aimed to develop a control strategy of an integrated system of cooperative adaptive cruise control  cacc  and variable speed limit  vsl  to reduce rear end collision risks near freeway bottlenecks  a microscopic simulation testbed was first constructed  in which the realistic path cacc models and surrogate safety measures of the time exposed time to collision  tet  and time integrated time to collision  tit  were used  a feedback control algorithm was then developed for the proposed vehicle to infrastructure system of cacc and vsl  the simulation results showed that the proposed integration system with 100  cacc penetration rate can reduce the rear end collision risks effectively  with the tit and tet declined by 98   the average travel time was also decreased by 33   compared with the manual vehicles without any control  moreover  the safety improvements of the proposed integrated system are quite stable at the various bottlenecks with different magnitudes of speed reductions  the sensitivity analyses suggested that the penetration rate of cacc has significant impact on safety performance  the vsl control plays an important role in reducing rear end collision risks when the penetration rate of cacc is low  the combination of cacc and vsl controls mitigates the negative effects of the mixed traffic flow of the manual and cacc vehicles  
 integrated gnss dr road segment information system for variable road user charging road user charging  ruc  is designed to reduce congestion and collect revenue for the maintenance of transportation infrastructure  in order to determine the charges  it is important that appropriate road user charging indicators  ruci  are defined  this paper focusses on variable road user charging  vruc  as the more dynamic and flexible compared to fixed road user charging  fruc   and thus is a better reflection of the utility of the road space  the main issues associated with vruc are the definition of appropriate charging indicators and their measurement  this paper addresses the former by proposing a number of new charging indicators  considering the equalization of the charges and marginal social cost imposed on others  the measurement of the indicators is addressed by a novel data fusion algorithm for the determination of the vehicle state based on the integration of global navigation satellite systems  gnss  with dead reckoning  dr  and road segment information  statistical analyses are presented in terms of the required navigation performance  rnp  parameters of accuracy  integrity  continuity and availability  based on simulation and field tests  it is shown that the proposed fusion model is superior to positioning with gps only  and gps plus glonass  in terms of all the rnp parameters with a significant improvement in availability   c  2017 elsevier ltd  all rights reserved

 interaction driver bicyclist on rural roads  effects of cross sections and road geometric elements the interaction of motorists and bicyclists  particularly during passing maneuvers  is cited as one of the primary causes of bicyclist fatalities  this paper reports the results of a driving simulator study  which sought to analyze the effects that three cross section configurations of a two lane rural road and four geometric elements of the road have on driver behavior  during the interaction with a cyclist  a two lane rural road  about 11 km long  was designed and implemented in an advanced interactive driving simulator  three different cross sections  all with same width  but with and without a bicycle lane and for different widths of bicycle lane  were tested  forty participants carried out three driving sessions  one for each road alignment with different cross section  and were exposed to the condition of bicycle traffic along four geometric elements of the alignment  2 tangents with different lengths  right curve and left curve   the driving simulator experiments were designed in such a way that  along the sections where the driver cyclist interactions occurred  the oncoming traffic was absent  overall  468 speed profiles and 468 lateral position profiles were plotted to obtain the descriptive variables of the driver behavior during the interaction with the cyclist  the influences of cross sections  geometric elements and bicycle traffic conditions on driver behavior were evaluated by a multivariate variance analysis  the presence of the cyclist determined different levels of influence on driver s trajectory for the three cross sections  a wider bicycle lane ensured a higher later clearance distance between driver and cyclist  allowing safer overtaking maneuver  the interferences of the cyclist on driver s behavior depended on the geometric elements  on tangents  the lowest lateral clearances were recorded and no speed reduction was observed  compared to the cyclist absence condition  on the left curve  the higher lateral clearance was recorded  due to the concordant tendencies of the driver to move away from the cyclist and to cut the curve  this determined an excessive and risky displacement of the vehicle to the opposing lane  whose criticality was also emphasized by the high speed adopted by the driver  on the right curve  the lateral clearance was higher than that recorded on the tangents  probably due to the necessity of the driver to perform the demanding maneuver of entering in the right curve  which also determined a speed reduction compared to the cyclist absence condition  the obtained results provide suggestions for the most efficient cross section reorganization of existing two lane rural roads in order to improve the road safety   c  2017 elsevier ltd  all rights reserved

 intersection crash prediction modeling with macro level data from various geographic units there have been great efforts to develop traffic crash prediction models for various types of facilities  the crash models have played a key role to identify crash hotspots and evaluate safety countermeasures  in recent  many macro level crash prediction models have been developed to incorporate highway safety considerations in the long term transportation planning process  although the numerous macro level studies have found that a variety of demographic and socioeconomic zonal characteristics have substantial effects on traffic safety  few studies have attempted to coalesce micro level with macro level data from existing geographic units for estimating crash models  in this study  the authors have developed a series of intersection crash models for total  severe  pedestrian  and bicycle crashes with macro level data for seven spatial units  the study revealed that the total  severe  and bicycle crash models with zip code tabulation area data performs the best  and the pedestrian crash models with census tract based data outperforms the competing models  furthermore  it was uncovered that intersection crash models can be drastically improved by only including random effects for macro level entities  besides  the intersection crash models are even further enhanced by including other macro level variables  lastly  the pedestrian and bicycle crash modeling results imply that several macro level variables  e g   population density  proportions of specific age group  commuters who walk  or commuters using bicycle  etc   can be a good surrogate exposure for those crashes   c  2017 elsevier ltd  all rights reserved  
 investigating actual landing and takeoff operations for time in mode  fuel and emissions parameters on domestic routes in turkey operational landing and takeoff standards developed by the international civil aviation organization  icao  in the 1970s  have been widely used in fuel consumption and emissions models or inventory studies  however  these generic standards may cause significant uncertainties due to changes in the air transport system over time and appear to remain highly conservative  to quantify the uncertainty caused by using generic operational standards  in this study  the effects of actual fuel flow and time in mode of more than 9000 different domestic flights  performed by five different narrow bodied aircraft models with seven different engine  on the averages of landing and takeoff fuel burn and emissions are investigated  compared to the simple approach  suggested by the icao  results indicate considerably lower time in mode averages  particularly during taxi out  42   and climb  45   phases  even for high traffic volume airports  the greatest differences in fuel flow are observed during takeoff and approach phases  as a result of using actual time in mode and fuel flow data  the actual landing and takeoff fuel burn averages are found to be 35  lower than icao values  in addition  the effects of low altitude level flight on approach phase fuel flow  thrust reverser mode on taxi in phase fuel flow  and stop and acceleration of aircraft on taxi ways on fuel flow are discussed  with regard to emissions  using actual time in mode and fuel flow data  landing and takeoff cycle hydrocarbon and carbon monoxide emissions are found to be 34  lower  while nitrogen oxide emissions are found to be 38  lower than those given by the icao database  analyses related to the effects of aircraft mass on emissions indicate that the differences for carbon monoxide and nitrogen oxides between the lightest and heaviest aircraft are 3  and 26   respectively  the analyses results reveal that uncertainties in landing and takeoff fuel burn and emissions caused by considering icao time in modes can be significantly higher compared to those caused by considering icao fuel flow standards   c  2017 elsevier ltd  all rights reserved  
 investigating articulated heavy vehicle crashes in western australia using a spatial approach background  recent developments in western australia s economy including widespread traffic congestion as well as road safety issues are increasingly becoming prominent  previous studies relied on traditional statistical methods to investigate patterns and characteristics of motor vehicle crashes  although useful  statistical analysis alone is incapable of providing a spatial context and is therefore unable to associate existing crash characteristics with a spatial distribution  aims  to identify concentrations or  hotspots  of articulated heavy vehicle crashes in wa between the years 2001 2013  by using a spatial analysis approach  methods  spatial modelling and spatio temporal analytical methods such as emerging hotspots were used to identify emerging hotspots on specific roads in western australia using the integrated road information system  iris   results  the results suggest that the majority of articulated heavy vehicles crashes occurred in the vicinity or within the perth metropolitan area  based on spatial temporal trend analyses  our findings highlight some regions that are emerging as areas of interest  discussion  this study was one of the first attempts to adopt a spatial analysis approach in studying heavy vehicle crashes in western australia  applying spatial methodologies to road safety data has the potential of obtaining previously undiscovered insights  which can be extended further  and provide future avenues to research in this field  
 investigating geospatial data usability from a health geography perspective using sensitivity analysis  the example of potential accessibility to primary healthcare network distance and travel times are two popular methods of measuring potential geographic accessibility and networks are also used in gravity model based approaches such as floating catchment area  fca  techniques  although some research has been conducted to assess the effectiveness of the representation of demand   population  or supply   destinations  side characteristics within such models  there have been few attempts to assess the implications of using alternative sources of network data  this study employs a sensitivity analysis approach to assess accessibility to gp surgeries in south wales using proprietary and open sources of network data  results suggest that there are significant differences between access scores derived from the use of networks which purport to portray the same features  furthermore  the pattern of differences varies between urban and rural areas  case studies are used to show that the actual representation of network based features  often overlooked in previous research  can have important implications for the findings from such studies  we conclude by suggesting that the use of sensitivity analysis to assess geospatial data usability has a wider relevance for studies that involve the use of a range of gis based techniques in different application areas

 investigating the relationship between jobs housing balance and traffic safety this study aimed to investigate the effects of jobs housing balance on traffic safety  the crash  demographic characteristics  employment  road network  household characteristics and traffic data were collected from the los angeles in 2010  one way anova tests indicated that the jobs housing ratio significantly affects traffic safety in terms of crash frequency at traffic analysis zone  taz   to quantify the safety impacts of jobs housing balance  the semi parametric geographically weighted poisson regression  s gwpr  was further used to link crash frequency at taz with jobs housing ratio and other contributing factors  the s gwpr provides better fitness to the data than do the generalized linear regression  as the s gwpr accounts for the spatial heterogeneity  the s gwpr results showed that the jobs housing relationship has a significant association with crash frequency at taz when the factors of traffic  network  and household characteristics are controlled  crash frequency at taz level increases with an increase in the jobs housing ratio  to further investigate the interactive effects between jobs housing ratio and other factors  a comparative analysis was conducted to compare the variable elasticities under different jobs housing ratios  the results indicate considerable interactive effects that traffic conditions and road network characteristics have different effects on crash frequency under various jobs housing ratios  
 investigating the theoretical cost relationships of urban consolidation centres for their users urban consolidation centres  uccs  are a popular measure in city logistics  although there are numerous pilot projects and test cases  many uccs are granted only a short life because they fail to attract a sufficient number of customers  evidence from literature shows that the cost attractiveness of ucc solutions for their users plays a major importance in their decision to use these facilities  indeed  since uccs involve additional service costs for their customers  in order to be financially attractive  they must demonstrate their ability to decrease delivery costs further in the transport chain  through distance or time gains  despite the significant interest of the practitioners and the research community in these facilities  there is a lack of knowledge and quantitative tools for assessing the costs of delivery operations and the potential savings by use of uccs  in this paper  authors propose an analytical approach to estimating costs of deliveries with and without the ucc based on the description of the logistics behaviour of the urban stakeholders from the literature  the analytical framework is then applied to a case of a ucc servicing brussels  the study shows that the main costs of deliveries are time related costs and that the use of the ucc can indeed decrease them  the main elements that influence the cost attractiveness of the uccs are the characteristics of a delivery operations  e g  number of stops  average number of cargo units per stop or the type of actor who performs the delivery   the characteristics of the ucc  e g  its location  the service price or the possibility of overnight deliveries  and the characteristics of the services area  e g  size of the town or delivery density    c  2016 elsevier ltd  all rights reserved  
 investigating transport network vulnerability by capacity weighted spectral analysis transport networks operating at or near capacity are vulnerable to disruptions  so flow bottlenecks are potent sources of vulnerability  this paper presents an efficient method for finding transport network cuts  which may constitute such bottlenecks  methods for assessing network vulnerability found in the literature require origin destination demands and path assignment  however  in transport network planning and design  demand information is often missing  out of date  partial or inaccurate  capacity weighted spectral partitioning is proposed to identify potential flow bottlenecks in the network  without reference to demand information or path assignments  this method identifies the network cut with least capacity  taking into account the relative sizes of the sub networks either side of the cut  spectral analysis has the added advantage of tractability  even for large networks  as shown by numerical examples for a five node illustrative example  the sioux falls road network and the gifu prefecture road network   c  2017 elsevier ltd  all rights reserved  
 investigation of factors affecting the injury severity of single vehicle rollover crashes  a random effects generalized ordered probit model rollover crashes are responsible for a notable number of serious injuries and fatalities  hence  they are of great concern to transportation officials and safety researchers  however  only few published studies have analyzed the factors associated with severity outcomes of rollover crashes  this research has two objectives  the first objective is to investigate the effects of various factors  of which some have been rarely reported in the existing studies  on the injury severities of single vehicle  sv  rollover crashes based on six year crash data collected on the malaysian federal roads  a random effects generalized ordered probit  regop  model is employed in this study to analyze injury severity patterns caused by rollover crashes  the second objective is to examine the performance of the proposed approach  regop  for modeling rollover injury severity outcomes  to this end  a mixed logit  mxl  model is also fitted in this study because of its popularity in injury severity modeling  regarding the effects of the explanatory variables on the injury severity of rollover crashes  the results reveal that factors including dark without supplemental lighting  rainy weather condition  light truck vehicles  e g   sport utility vehicles  vans   heavy vehicles  e g   bus  truck   improper overtaking  vehicle age  traffic volume and composition  number of travel lanes  speed limit  undulating terrain  presence of central median  and unsafe roadside conditions are positively associated with more severe sv rollover crashes  on the other hand  unpaved shoulder width  area type  driver occupation  and number of access points are found as the significant variables decreasing the probability of being killed or severely injured  i e   ksi  in rollover crashes  land use and side friction are significant and positively associated only with slight injury category  these findings provide valuable insights into the causes and factors affecting the injury severity patterns of rollover crashes  and thus can help develop effective countermeasures to reduce the severity of rollover crashes  the model comparison results show that the regop model is found to outperform the mxl model in terms of goodness of fit measures  and also is significantly superior to other extensions of ordered probit models  including generalized ordered probit and random effects ordered probit  reop  models  as a result  this research introduces regop as a promising tool for future research focusing on crash injury severity  
 investigation of objective parameters for acceptance evaluation of automatic lane change system recently  with increased interest in high levels of automated driving systems such as automatic lane change system  the need for reliable assessment methods of driver acceptance has arisen  because the acceptance depends on the individual  the assessment of the acceptance can only be based on an individual s personal attitude  expectations  and experiences  accordingly  subjective evaluation methods have mostly been utilized to assess the acceptance of newly developed advanced driver assistance systems  in this study  an investigation of the effects of vehicle dynamic behavior and the traffic environment on driver acceptance is conducted to provide an objective evaluation method of driver acceptance for an automatic lane change system  in order to conduct the investigation  a specific experimental program is designed and a massive database  including information on interaction behaviors between drivers  a vehicle and the traffic environment is constructed with a selected group of 19 drivers  then  21 parameters and their descriptive statistics for an objective evaluation index are presented to illustrate the analysis results  the results of this research can be important not only for an objective evaluation of the acceptance  but can also be expanded to suggest design criteria for control of advanced and automated driving assistance systems  
 investigation of the traffic congestion during public holiday and the impact of the toll exemption policy traffic congestion has long been a noticeable issue worldwide  besides congestion caused by the daily commuters  congestion during public holidays is also very typical  the traffic volume often has a sharp increase during public holidays  which puts a heavy burden on the road capacity and results in severe congestion  this is especially true for the beginning and ending of the holidays  the situation is even worse under some government policies designed initially to benefit people  e g  the highway toll exemption during public holidays in china  the focus of this paper is to model the evolution of traffic congestion caused by the demand from residential place to the famous resorts during public holidays  the research questions include   1  how do tourists tradeoff between schedule delay  queuing time and the overcrowding of the resort  and  2  the impact of the toll exemption policy during public holidays on tourists  departure time choices and the social welfare  by adopting the bottleneck model  we obtain the cumulative departure curves of tourists during public holidays  closed form results of tourists  departure time variation with the toll exemption policy are obtained  as well as the resulting social efficiency loss  which is significant for the management of the traffic mobility during public holidays   c  2017 elsevier ltd  all rights reserved  
 investing in logistics facilities today to reduce routing emissions tomorrow we investigate the trade off between strategic investment in facilities and the long term environmental impact of daily logistics operations  for that purpose  we consider a bi objective location routing problem with the objectives of minimising the cost of strategic investments such as locating facilities and acquiring different types of vehicles  and minimising pollution by using co2 emissions as an indicator  a set of representative days of operations are used to estimate the long term environmental impact  after modelling that problem as a mixed integer program  we develop a decomposition approach that constructs routes  then uses them in a separate set covering model to generate complete solutions  the suitability of our approach is investigated on benchmark test instances as well as on a case study in the city of vienna  experiments show that our approach is a valuable tool in aiding such long term decisions   c  2017 elsevier ltd  all rights reserved  
 investors  behavior and dynamics of ship prices  a heterogeneous agent model distinguishing investors into speculators and operators  and classifying the former group into momentum and contrarian investors  we develop a heterogeneous agent model  ham  to examine the dynamics of price of second hand dry bulk ships  the results suggest that momentum strategies based on short term measures of earnings perform significantly better than the contrarian or passive  buy and hold  strategies  the ham seems to capture the dynamics of vessel prices and the investors  behavior in the market for ships very well  finally  an increase in participation of momentum investors tends to increase price volatility  whereas higher demand from contrarian investors seems to lower price variability   c  2017 elsevier ltd  all rights reserved  
 is accessibility relevant in trip generation  modelling the interaction between trip generation and accessibility taking into account spatial effects the influence of accessibility to opportunities in trip generation continues to be debated in the specialised literature given its relevance to simulate phenomena such as induced demand  this article estimates multiple linear regression models  mlr   spatial autoregressive models  sar   spatial autoregressive models in the error term  sem  and spatially filtered poisson regression models  spo  to discover whether or not accessibility is a significant factor in trip generation using data from the urban area of santander  spain   the results obtained provide evidence which shows that  on an intraurban scale  more accessibility to opportunities decreases trip production in private vehicle for work purpose  whereas it increases trip production in other transport modes for non mandatory purposes  for the correct interpretation of the estimated parameters it was important to consider the direct and indirect effects of the independent variables in the sar production models  finally  the validation of the models showed that the sar and sem models had a mean squared error slightly lower than the mlr models in predicting overall trip production  this was because the spatial models reduced the correlation of the residuals present in the mlr models  furthermore  the spo models performed better in validation mode than all the continuous models  
 is developing air cargo airports in the hinterland the way of the future  in this paper  we provide an analytical framework to capture the competition  and cooperation  between gateway and hinterland airports  we first investigate how airport charges at gateway and hinterland airports affect the equilibrium output in passenger and cargo markets  we further consider the pearl river delta region in china as a setting to conduct a numerical analysis  we find that the introduction of a hinterland airport is likely to lead to an improvement in the aggregate welfare of the gateway and the hinterland  if the connectivity between the gateway and hinterland airports is improved  then social welfare at the gateway and hinterland  benefits for shippers and passengers  and airport and airline profits at the gateway airport will increase  however  airport and airline profits at the hinterland airport will decrease   c  2016 elsevier ltd  all rights reserved  
 is eu financial support enhancing  the economic performance of ppp projects  an empirical analysis on the case of spanish road infrastructure during the last few decades  the european union has been promoting the use of ppps in order to accelerate the development of the ten t for ensuring economic  social and territorial cohesion and increasing accessibility within the eu  to that end  several mechanisms have been put at the disposal of the member states to enhance transport infrastructure of interest for the eu  this paper conducts a review of the main funding programs implemented by the eu authorities in order to evaluate to what extent the european support has been rightly channelled to ppp projects  to that end  a multiple regression model has been applied to road ppp projects in spain to analyse whether those ppp projects with eu financial backing ultimately have a higher economic performance compared to those projects not receiving such a support  the research concludes that there is a positive correlation between receiving european financial support and the good economic performance of those projects  
 is fare increment desirable for ensuring operational viability of private buses  the paper reports an investigation on the requirement of fare increment for achieving the operational viability of private buses in the context of an emerging country  taking an existing route in kolkata city which is served by private buses  several scenarios were investigated to achieve the viability of service through interventions in fare  design of service  and supply of buses  a simulation framework was used for the evaluation of various scenarios  the study brings out new evidences to question the conventional approach of increasing the bus fare to satisfy the operational viability  it is shown that the fare and the revenue requirements are distorted due to the oversupply of buses and non optimal service  the analysis shows that even with the present fare  it is possible to resolve the viability issue by optimizing the service and supply  the results presented in the paper are case specific but are likely to encourage policy makers to carry out similar investigations in other cities in india as well as in other developing countries to improve urban bus service without putting an additional burden on the users  
 is in cabin exposure to carbon monoxide and fine particulate matter amplified by the vehicle s self pollution potential  quantifying the rate of exhaust intrusion in cabin exposure has increased in recent years due to longer commute and or prolonged times in cars  the intrusion of the vehicle s own exhaust into the passenger s compartment has been recognized as a process that amplifies in cabin passenger exposure  quantifying its contribution is hampered by uncertainties associated with its measurement method such as trace tests and the lack of data regarding certain critical physical parameters  particularly those pertaining to air exchange rate  aer  and particulate matter deposition rate  dr   in this study  we present a hybrid methodology combining field measurements with a single zone mass balance to estimate these parameters as well as the source term that represents vehicle self pollution  in  and out vehicle carbon monoxide  co  and fine particulate matter  pm2 5  were monitored concurrently in test vehicles under idle and moving conditions using several common ventilation modes  in addition to defining a hybrid methodology to characterize the underlying physical parameters  this study found that vehicle self pollution can account for approximately 15 and 30  of co and pm2 5 exposure experienced by vehicle occupants respectively  vehicle self exhaust intrusion may constitute a significant pm exposure route for vehicle based occupations or commuters with prolonged time in vehicles   c  2017 elsevier ltd  all rights reserved  
 is there an observational effect  an exploratory study into speed cameras and self reported offending behaviour fixed and mobile speed cameras are an important element of enforcement initiatives designed to create a strong deterrent effect and improve road safety  despite the widespread use of the technology and the need to create a strong deterrent effect  research has yet to determine if there is a relationship between levels of exposure to the devices and subsequent self reported deterrent effects  as a result  licensed motorists  n   536  51  female  in queensland  australia  were recruited to complete a questionnaire that measured exposure to speed cameras and associated offending behaviours  data were analyzed utilising descriptive  bivariate and multivariate statistics  the key findings that emerged were  the sample reported a higher level of exposure to fixed cameras  even though there are more operational mobile cameras   younger males were most likely to speed and be observant of speed cameras and that perceived certainty of apprehension was the largest reported deterrent force  however  a positive  rather than negative  relationship was found between perceived camera exposure levels and speeding behaviours  which indicates a range of additional factors  both legal and non legal factors as well as driving exposure levels  influence speed limit non compliance  furthermore  multivariate analysis revealed that higher levels of perceptual certainty were associated with general speed compliance and perceptions of the severity and swiftness of sanctions  rather than levels of self reported camera exposure  this paper is the first to reveal that while motorists prone to speed may be more cognisant of speed camera operations  this in itself does not ensure appropriate behaviour modification  
 is there more traffic congestion in larger cities   scaling analysis of the 101 largest us urban centers  over the past three decades  urban congestion has become more costly in terms of time  money  and fuel  for the top 101 largest us urban centers  congestion generated 4 8 billion hours of travel delays in 2011  up from 1 1 billion hours in 1982  congestion also required 8 419 million cubic meters of excess fuel consumption in 2011  up from 1 73 million cubic meters in 1982  filially  the excess co2 emitted from congestion amounted to 19 524 billion kilograms in 2011  up from 3 94 billion kilograms in 1982  we examined the scaling relationships between the population sizes of urban centers and traffic congestion for four subgroups of urban centers with varying population sizes  we found that scaling relationships were superlinear for most subgroups  however  for the subgroup comprising mega cities with populations of over 3 million people  the relationship was linear  the varying scaling relationships we found for cities with different population sizes may resolve the contradictory scaling results reported in the extant literature  several other implications from our findings are also discussed  
 is traffic congestion overrated  examining the highly variable effects of congestion on travel and accessibility congestion is universally unpopular  but is it always a problem  are some places more  congestion adapted  than others  using data for los angeles  we examine whether the geographies of congestion and accessibility are distinct by mapping and describing them across neighborhoods  we then estimate a series of regression models of trip making to test the net effects of traffic delays on behavior  we find that there are places where people make many trips and engage in many activities despite lots of congestion  which tend to be more central  built up areas that host many short trips  in other places  high congestion and low activity coincide  why the variance  while congestion can constrain mobility and reduce accessibility  traffic is also associated with agglomerations of activity and is thus a by product of proximity based accessibility  whether agglomeration and congestion have net positive or negative impacts on activity participation thus varies substantially over space  controlling for factors such as income and working at home  we find that the effects of congestion on access depend on whether congestion adaptive travel choices  such as walking and making shorter trips to nearby destinations  are viable  because  congestion adapted  places tend to host more trip making  planners may be justified in creating more such places in order to increase accessibility  even if doing so makes absolute levels of congestion worse in the process  
 is vehicle automation enough to prevent crashes  role of traffic operations in automated driving environments for traffic safety automated driving systems  adss  are expected to prevent traffic accidents caused by driver carelessness on freeways  there is no doubt regarding this safety benefit if all vehicles in the transportation system were equipped with adss  however  it is implausible to expect that adss will reach 100  market penetration rate  mpr  in the near future  therefore  the following question arises   can adss  which consider only situations in the vicinity of an equipped vehicle  really contribute to a significant reduction in traffic accidents   to address this issue  the interactions between equipped and unequipped vehicles must be investigated  which is the purpose of this study  this study evaluated traffic safety at different mprs based on a proposed index to represent the overall rear end crash risk of the traffic stream  two approaches were evaluated for adjusting longitudinal vehicle maneuvers  vehicle safety based maneuvering  vsm   which considers the crash risk of an equipped vehicle and its neighboring vehicles  and traffic safety based maneuvering  tsm   which considers the overall crash risk in the traffic stream  tsm assumes that traffic operational agencies are able to monitor all the vehicles and to intervene in vehicle maneuvering  an optimization process  which attempts to obtain vehicle maneuvering control parameters to minimize the overall crash risk  is integrated into the proposed evaluation framework  the main purpose of employing the optimization process for vehicle maneuvering in this study is to identify opportunities to improve traffic safety through effective traffic management rather than developing a vehicle control algorithm that can be implemented in practice  the microscopic traffic simulator vissim was used to simulate the freeway traffic stream and to conduct systematic evaluations based on the proposed methodology  both tsm and vsm achieved significant reductions in the potential for rear end crashes  however  tsm obtained much greater reductions when the mpr was greater than 50   this study should inspire transportation researchers and engineers to develop effective traffic operations strategies for automated driving environments  
 isolating high priority metro and feeder bus transfers using smart card data fixed rail metro  or  subway   infrastructure is generally unable to provide access to all parts of the city grid  consequently  feeder bus lines are an integral component of urban mass transit systems  while passengers prefer a seamless transfer between these two distinct transportation services  each service s operations are subject to a different set of factors that contribute to metro bus transfer delay  previous attempts to understand transfer delay were limited by the availability of tools to measure the time and cost associated with passengers  transfer experience  this paper uses data from smart card systems  an emerging technology that automatically collects passenger trip data  to understand transfer delay  the primary objective of this study is to use smart card data to derive a reproducible methodology that isolates high priority transfer points between the metro system and its feeder bus systems  the paper outlines a methodology to identify transfer transactions in the smart card dataset  estimate bus headways without the aid of geographic location information  estimate three components of the total transfer time  walking time  waiting time  and delay time   and isolate high priority transfer pairs  the paper uses smart card data from nanjing  china as a case study  the results isolate eight high priority metro bus transfer pairs in the nanjing metro system and finally  offers several targeted measures to improve transfer efficiency  
 japan s transport planning at national level  natural disasters  and their interplays this research aims to give an overview of japan s national level transport planning schemes  and to discuss interplays between them and recoveries from natural disasters  in the first part  japan s national spatial development plans and long term planning schemes for railway  road  port and airport infrastructures are reviewed and compared  in the second part  imbalance embedded in the current planning scheme for different modes are demonstrated making use of recent post disaster reconstruction processes  a literature based desktop research is carried out focusing on japanese literature  these include  but not limited to  official government reports and planning documents  statistical data  and handbooks for experts in the field  all of the long distance modes have their planning schemes with different levels of comprehensiveness and robustness for each mode  expressways and high speed railways have the most comprehensive and robust network plans  while conventional railway  airports and seaports have ones with limited extent  because of this  post disaster reconstruction processes from damages to the infrastructure work differently in particular for conventional railways and for expressways in rural areas  which are competitors against each other  strong framework for intermodal and multimodal transport is still in lack in japan  important structural imbalance between modes  in particular between conventional railway and expressway exist  and it becomes obvious in case of a natural disaster  multimodal planning  frameworks for flexible adjustment of once made long term plans  and addressing imbalances regarding robustness between railways and expressways are identified as future challenges of the country s planning schemes  
 job accessibility and employment outcomes  which income groups benefit the most  improving job accessibility can increase the probability for individual persons to be employed and reduce their commutes  empirical research suggests that the relationship between job accessibility and employment outcomes differ across income groups  but no research has investigated the difference or explored which income groups benefit the most from job accessibility improvements  this research fills the gap by examining six income groups in the los angeles metropolitan area  results show that job accessibility affects the employment status of medium to low income groups  household income between us 25 000 and us 75 000   for the lowest income group  household income lower than us 25 000   owning a car significantly improves their chances to be employed  but job accessibility has no effect  on the other hand  higher job accessibility is associated with shorter commuting distance for the other five income groups  but not for the lowest income group  these results suggest that transportation and land use policies need to address the specific needs of distinct population groups and underscore the importance of spatial access for the middle class  which tends to be overlooked in the literature on transportation equity

 joint optimal train regulation and passenger flow control strategy for high frequency metro lines to improve the headway regularity and commercial speed of high frequency metro lines with overloaded passenger flow  this paper systematically investigates a joint optimal dynamic train regulation and passenger flow control design for metro lines  a coupled state space model for the evolution of the departure time and the passenger load of each train at each station is explicitly developed  the dwell time of the train is affected by the number of entering and exiting passengers  combining dynamic train regulation and passenger flow control  a dynamic optimisation problem that minimises the timetable and the headway deviations for metro lines is developed  by applying a model predictive control  mpc  method  we formulate the problem of finding the optimal joint train regulation and passenger flow control strategy as the problem of solving a set of quadratic programming  qp  problems  under which an optimal control law can be numerically calculated efficiently using a quadratic programming algorithm  moreover  based on the lyapunov stability theory  the stability  convergence  of the metro line system under the proposed optimal control algorithm is verified  numerical examples are given to illustrate the effectiveness of the proposed method   c  2017 elsevier ltd  all rights reserved  
 joint optimization of tram timetables and signal timing adjustments at intersections this paper explores at the planning level the benefits of coordinating tram movements and signal timings at controlled intersections  although trams may have dedicated travel lanes  they mostly operate in a mixed traffic environment at intersections  to ensure tram progression  pre set signal timings at intersections are adjusted by activating transit signal priority  tsp  actions  which inevitably add delays to the auto traffic  a mixed integer program is proposed for jointly determining tram schedules for a single tram line and modifying signal timings at major controlled intersections  the objective is to minimize the weighted sum of the total tram travel time and tsp s negative impacts on other traffic  a real world case study of line 5 of the shenyang hunnan modern tramway shows that by extending the dwell time or link travel time we can significantly reduce the tsp s negative impacts on the auto traffic while only slightly increasing tram travel times   c  2017 elsevier ltd  all rights reserved

 keeping cargo security costs down  a risk based approach to air cargo airport security in small and medium airports european union regulations are not sensible to the proportionality of measures and provide fixed orientations and standards irrespective from the dimension of the airports  additional security measures have been added over the years resulting in increasing security related costs  the cost structure of security exhibits the existence of a relevant fixed component  concerning staff  equipment  or certification  notable  smaller  and medium airports support higher costs of security than larger airports  due to the low volumes of cargo and passenger movements  alternative approaches  notably risk based  have been advocated to support the definition of security procedures at airport level  although studies have been conducted  none was found concerning these types of airports  this paper presents a research aimed to analyse the appropriateness of a risk based approach in the context of small to medium airports  the research focused in understanding whether such approach could provide tailored security requirements and  ideally  lower costs  a case study considering six airports   horta  lisbon  and ponta delgada  portugal   and adana sakirpasa  erkilet international and istanbul  turkey    of different sizes and located in different regions was conducted  the results make evident the advantages of a risk based approach to define appropriate security procedures  although it is not evident that a risk based approach will lower costs   c  2017 elsevier ltd  all rights reserved  
 key challenges in tram streetcar driving from the tram driver s perspective   a qualitative study tram drivers have a difficult task in controlling one of the heaviest vehicles on the road whilst negotiating a complex road environment with multiple road users  like all public transport drivers  tram drivers need to ensure passenger safety and to run on time  however  very little research has been conducted evaluating tram driving tasks and even less on evaluating tram drivers opinion on how other road users are affecting tram road safety  therefore  the aim of this study is to investigate the key tram driving challenges  to identify the key road user factors affecting tram road safety as well as to explore the potential safety improvement initiatives on tram routes from the tram drivers  viewpoint  the study incorporated five focus groups involving thirty tram drivers in melbourne  the key themes emerged inductively from focus groups were identified through a data coding process  outcomes of the focus groups revealed seven major challenges in tram driving  ensuring safety for all people in and around the tram  pressure for running on time  maintaining constant concentration on roads  predicting other road users  behavior in advance to avoid any crash incident  preventing passenger falls on board  accepting the operational constraints of trams and managing fatigue workloads  tram drivers identified that other road users are unaware of safety issues around trams  have a poor understanding of road rules about driving with trams and often violate road rules around trams  and they mentioned this road user behaviors as the key challenges for safe tram driving  tram drivers proposed rendering greater law enforcement on the tram network to penalize road users who are violating road rules around trams  introducing more safety campaigns and safety education to increase awareness among road users to improve tram road safety  findings of this research enhance understanding of tram driving challenges  provide an in depth knowledge of road user factors affecting tram road safety and suggest effective planning strategies for transit agencies to improve road safety   c  2017 published by elsevier ltd  
 key factors influencing the global passenger transport dynamics using the aim transport model a bottom up passenger transport model named aim  asia pacific integrated model  transport model is developed by incorporating behavioral parameters and transportation technological details  this model is based on discrete based choice modelling covering 17 global regions soft linked with the aim cge  computable general equilibrium  model  in this paper  the model is used to assess the impact of various factors like travel time  energy efficiency improvement  load factor  mode preference along with environmental awareness factors on transport demand  energy and emissions  the modelling assessment results show that travel speed and land ust patterns have significant impact on the travel demand  high occupancy rate and shift towards the mass transit system result in energy and emissions reduction  implementation of carbon tax aligned with the two degree target results in a 22  cumulative emission reduction from 2005 to 2100 relative to the baseline case  however  the reduction potential can be increased to 42  by combining behavioral and technology related mitigation options like mass transit system speed improvement  transit oriented development  efficiency improvement  preference towards eco friendly technologies and high vehicle occupancy   c  2017 the authors  published by elsevier ltd  
 kinematic wave models of lane drop bottlenecks lane drop bottlenecks lead to both capacity reduction and capacity drop  but there are no systematic studies on traffic dynamics  especially the stationary traffic patterns when the upstream link is congested  at such critical bottlenecks within the framework of kinematic wave theory  in this paper  we study three kinematic wave models for both discontinuous and continuous lane drop bottlenecks  where the number of lanes drops either suddenly or gradually  in the first two models  we apply the multilane lwr model  lighthill and whitham  1955  richards  1956  for a discontinuous and continuous lane drop bottleneck  respectively  in the third model  we assume that the standing wave is instantaneous inside a continuous lane drop bottleneck  for the first model  we apply the kinematic wave theory developed in jin et al   2009  to solve the riemann problem  in particular  we present an optimization formulation for the entropy condition  solve the stationary states and kinematic waves on both upstream and downstream links  and define instantaneous discontinuous standing waves connecting the upstream and downstream links  stationary states  for the second model  we define a generalized riemann problem and show that the asymptotic stationary states and kinematic waves on both links are the same as those in the first model  but the asymptotic standing wave is continuous  comprising of stationary states inside the whole lane drop zone  assuming standing waves to be instantaneous as in the first model but continuous as in the second model  we present a new model of a continuous lane drop bottleneck and a new theoretical framework to solve the generalized riemann problem  finally we develop three corresponding cell transmission models and verify theoretical results  especially the presence and structure of continuous standing waves inside a continuous lane drop zone  with numerical examples  we find that vehicles  acceleration rates across the standing waves can be infinite in the first model and unrealistically large in the other two and that there is no capacity drop in all of the models  the theoretical framework of the third model forms a basis for a follow up study   fin  2017   in which we introduce bounded acceleration as an additional constraint on the instantaneous standing waves and present a behavioral model of capacity drop   c  2017 elsevier ltd  all rights reserved  
 knowledge  attitudes  and behaviors related to child safety restraint in citizens of shenzhen municipality  china  and the associations between these factors objective  a child safety restraint  csr  is an effective measure to reduce the risk of child injury from traffic collisions  this study aims to explore knowledge  attitudes  and behaviors regarding csrs in a chinese population methods  a cross sectional survey regarding csr use was conducted from april to may 2014 in shenzhen municipality  respondents were parents who had at least one child 0 to 6years of age and owned a car  these parents provided a self report of demographic characteristics as well as information about their knowledge  attitudes  and behaviors toward csr use results  most respondents had a fair level of knowledge about csrs  with higher mean knowledge scores demonstrated among the respondents who were male  had an advanced degree  had a higher income  owned an expensive car  had an older child  drove frequently with children  and routinely drove greater distances with children  in addition  most respondents had a more positive attitude toward csr use  with a higher mean attitude score among those who had an advanced degree  owned an expensive car  drove frequently with children  and routinely drove greater distances with children  however  some myths regarding csr use also existed  e g   parents can effectively protect their children in a car collision by holding them  they are not required to purchase the csr for child safety if there is no mandatory provision by law  among others   among 3 768 respondents who had at least one child and a car  27 8   1 047  had a csr and 22 9   864  used the csr  a logistic regression model showed the likelihood of csr ownership to be higher if respondents drove frequently or greater distances and was dependent on both the education level of the respondents and the age of the children  the frequency of csr use increased as the age of children decreased  p    0274   respondents who owned a csr and those who frequently used csrs had higher mean knowledge and mean attitude scores conclusions  this observational study found that although the majority of respondents had fair levels of knowledge and positive attitudes  they had lower rates of csr ownership and use  therefore  efforts at developing opportunities to expand public awareness of csr use should be made to improve child passenger safety practices and eliminate child injury caused by traffic collisions  
 l 1  minimization method for link flow correction a computational method  based on l 1  minimization  is proposed for the problem of link flow correction  when the available traffic flow data on many links in a road network are inconsistent with respect to the flow conservation law  without extra information  the problem is generally ill posed when a large portion of the link sensors are unhealthy  it is possible  however  to correct the corrupted link flows accurately with the proposed method under a recoverability condition if there are only a few bad sensors which are located at certain links  we analytically identify the links that are robust to miscounts and relate them to the geometric structure of the traffic network by introducing the recoverability concept and an algorithm for computing it  the recoverability condition for corrupted links is simply the associated recoverability being greater than 1  in a more realistic setting  besides the unhealthy link sensors  small measurement noises may be present at the other sensors  under the same recoverability condition  our method guarantees to give an estimated traffic flow fairly close to the ground truth data and leads to a bound for the correction error  both synthetic and real world examples are provided to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method   c  2017 elsevier ltd  all rights reserved  
 lagrangian relaxation for the reliable shortest path problem with correlated link travel times finding a reliable shortest path  rsp  in a stochastic network is a fundamental problem in transportation science  link travel time correlation significantly affects path reliability  but also greatly increases the complexity of the rsp problem due to the quadratic form of the standard deviation term  lagrangian relaxation  lr  based on problem reformulation  which only needs to solve a series of shortest path problems  has been recognized as an efficient method to obtain near optimal rsps with the optimality gap guarantee  this paper proposes a novel lr approach based on a new convex problem reformulation  and new methods to update lagrangian multipliers and handle negative cycles of the resulting shortest path problems  different from existing lr approaches  which adopt the classical subgradient method to solve the dual problem  a constraint generation  cg  algorithm and a subgradient projection  sp  algorithm are proposed to update lagrangian multipliers effectively  and both algorithms are further modified to handle negative cycles  we also reveal the connection between different reformulations of the rsp problem and show that the proposed approach has a smaller duality gap than existing ones  experiments on real transportation networks validate the effectiveness of the proposed approach in terms of convergence rate  run time  duality gap and optimality by comparison with the existing lr approaches and the outer approximation algorithm   c  2017 elsevier ltd  all rights reserved  
 latent lifestyle and mode choice decisions when travelling short distances in the quest for sustainable travel  short distances appear the most amenable to curbing the use of the automobile  existing studies about short trips evaluate the potential of shifting from the automobile to sustainable travel options while considering the population as homogeneous in its preferences and its tendency to accept these alternative travel options as realistic  however  this assumption appears quite unrealistic and the current study offers a different perspective  the mode choices when travelling short distances are likely related to lifestyle decisions  short trip chains of a representative sample of the danish population in the copenhagen region were analysed  and more specifically a latent class choice model was estimated to uncover latent lifestyle groups and choice specific travel behaviour  results show that four lifestyle groups are identified in the population  car oriented  bicycle oriented  public transport oriented and public transport averse  each lifestyle group has specific perceptions of travel time  with extremely different rates of substitution between alternative travel modes   transfer penalties in public transport trip chains  weather influence  especially on active travel modes   and trip purpose effect on mode selection  consequently  when thinking about measures to increase the appeal of sustainable travel options  decision makers should look at specific individuals within the population and more sensitive individuals to comfort and level of service improvements across the lifestyle groups  
 latent segmentation  hazard based models of travel time growing interest in performance reliability and improving data availability is motivating a shift toward probabilistic treatments of travel time across a number of intelligent transportation system applications  hazard based analysis supports the development of probabilistic travel time models and latent class style methodologies capture how the mechanisms affecting travel time are expected to differ based on congestion status  benefiting from rich data available for metropolitan freeway travel times in the san francisco bay area  this paper studies how congestion state  traffic demand  roadway variables  and weather impact travel time performance in a probabilistic regime  congestion state is captured as an inferred yet unobserved segmentation in the data using latent segmentation  and hazard based models of travel times are developed for the congested and uncongested classes  the final model represents an intuitive description of the factors that probabilistically influence travel time on freeways  the predicted aggregation shows excellent agreement with the data  with opportunities for improvement in the data sources and complexity of the latent segmentation  the final model nevertheless represents a simple yet flexible solution for understanding the relationships between travel time  traffic state  and relevant behavioral  geometric  and environmental factors  
 learning game for training child bicyclists  situation awareness encouraging more children to bicycle would produce both environmental and health benefits  but bicycling accidents are a major source of injuries and fatalities among children  one reason for this may be children s less developed hazard perception skills  we assume that children s situation awareness could be trained with a computer based learning game  which should also improve their hazard perception skills  in this paper  we present a prototype for such a game and pilot it with 8 9 year old children  the game consisted of videos filmed from a bicyclist s perspective  using a touchscreen  the player s task was to point out targets early enough to gain points  the targets were either overt  other visible road users on a potentially conflicting course  or covert  occlusions  i e  locations where other road users could suddenly emerge   if a target was missed or identified too late  the video was paused and feedback was given  the game was tested with 49 children from the 2nd grade of primary school  aged 8 9   31 young adults  aged 22 34  played the game for comparison  the effect of the game on situation awareness was assessed with situation awareness tests in a crossover design  similar videos were used in the tests as in the game  but instead of pointing out the targets while watching  the video was suddenly masked and participants were asked to locate all targets which had been present just before the masking  choosing among several possible locations  their performance was analyzed using signal detection theory and answer latencies  the game decreased answer latency and marginally changed response bias in a less conservative direction for both children and adults  but it did not significantly increase sensitivity for targets  adults performed better in the tests and in the game  and it was possible to satisfactorily predict group membership based on the scores  children found it especially difficult to find covert targets  overall  the described version of the learning game cannot be regarded as an effective tool for situation awareness hazard perception training  but ways to improve the game are discussed   c  2016 elsevier ltd  all rights reserved  
 lessons from building paratransit operators  capacity to be partners in cape town s public transport reform process in 2013 the cape town municipality initiated planning for the second phase of its myciti bus system  the first phase  on which preparations commenced in 2007  relied on incorporating existing road based operators in a bus rapid transit  brt  system  the municipality underestimated the cost and level of effort involved in the wholesale corporatisation of paratransit operators while concurrently equipping them to become brt operators  learning from this experience  it developed a more incremental transition approach in the second phase  the first fruit of which was a pilot express bus service launched in mid 2014  the pilot service contract also provided for a training programme for paratransit operators in the affected parts of the city to build their managerial and technical capacity  it was envisaged that programme participants would ultimately manage and run the long term operating companies and contracts that would be established by the end of the three year interim period  this article provides a critical review of the programme s context  content and participant experiences after the conclusion of its first year  in broad terms the programme has made a positive contribution to paratransit participants  understanding of the shortcomings of their current operations and why reform might be necessary  but much still remains to be done to enable them to fill their envisaged roles in future public transport operations  in view of growing interest in brt installation in sub saharan africa lessons from cape town s reform process offer both cautionary evidence and a potential mechanism for drawing existing operators in as partners in reform  
 lessons learned from a personalized travel planning  ptp  research program to reduce car dependence voluntary travel behavior change programs have been implemented worldwide since the late 1990s at a personal and community level  most of the now completed programs were commissioned by local authorities to commercial firms  in an attempt to reduce private car use  in this context  the evaluation and review of the reliability of these policy measures have been at the core of most of the debates and studies in this field  in this paper  we describe the lessons learned from a research program funded by the sardinian government  italy   aimed at testing a soft transport policy measure for reducing car dependence  in particular  the work reviews in detail the methodological approach and participants  feedback on a personalized travel plan  ptp   after implementation of the soft measure  the ptp participants were divided into two groups depending on whether they had reduced car use or not  and separate analyses were conducted to highlight the factors underlying different behavior change decisions  general conclusions regarding the effectiveness of the ptp are beyond the scope of the present study  
 letting in vehicle navigation lead the way  older drivers  perceptions of and ability to follow a gps navigation system in vehicle navigation systems have the potential to simplify the driving task by reducing the drivers  need to engage in wayfinding  especially in unfamiliar environments  this study sought to characterize older drivers  overall assessment of using in vehicle gps technology as part of a research study and to explore whether the use of this technology has an impact on participants  driving behaviour  forty seven older drivers completed an on road evaluation where directions were provided by an in vehicle gps navigation system and their behaviour was recorded using video technology  they later completed a questionnaire to assess their perception of the navigation system  after the study  participants were grouped based on whether they were able to accurately follow the instructions provided by the navigation system  the results indicated that most drivers were satisfied with the navigation technology and found the directions it provided to be clear  there were no statistically significant differences in the number of on road errors committed by drivers who did not follow the directions from the navigation system in comparison to drivers who did follow the directions   c  2016 elsevier ltd  all rights reserved  
 licence to build  licence to charge  market power  pricing and the financing of airport infrastructure development in australia in 2017  airport privatisation in australia reached a 20 year milestone  with its regulatory framework been shifted to a light handed regulation in 2002  the light handed regulation  lhr   as in place at australia s top four airports  has been suggested as the  frontier of international policy   leading to increasing interest among transport policymakers and researchers  this article offers an in depth examination of the lhr with focus on a  the market power of the regulated airports  b  the commercial price negotiations between airports and airlines  and c  the airports  behaviour towards infrastructure investment  the article reports on data from 21 semi structured interviews conducted with key stakeholder groups affected by  or with expertise in  the lhr  findings suggest that despite airports possessing significant market power  particularly in the domestic market  the light handed approach seems to balance the forces in a market where an airline duopoly prevails  qantas and virgin australia groups   in addition  both airports and airlines perceive that commercial price negotiations are improving and refrain from a return to a stronger regulation environment  for airlines  value for money is the primary concern in new infrastructure investments  interviewees also outlined specific recommendations for improving the lhr framework  including a more accessible arbitrator and improved methodologies to monitor prices and quality of service  the findings point towards the significance of vertical relationships  long term arrangements  and transparency as key aspects of the lhr and the development of airport infrastructure  
 life cycle ghg emissions and lifetime costs of medium duty diesel and battery electric trucks in toronto  canada battery electric trucks  bet  are an alternative to diesel trucks and have the potential for lower life cycle greenhouse gas  ghg  emissions and total lifetime costs  tco   this study compares a class 6 medium duty bet with a class 6 medium duty diesel truck  vehicle fuel consumption is simulated for toronto driving conditions  based on different drive cycles  operating temperatures and payloads  the base case results show the bet has lower life cycle ghg emissions and higher lifetime tco than the diesel truck  but this does not hold across all conditions  ghg emissions of the bet are higher than those of the diesel truck under 100  payload in driving conditions with infrequent stops  while the results are less sensitive to operating temperature  the lifetime cost of the bet can be lower than that of the diesel truck in situations that have driving with frequent stops starts and with low payloads and low battery and charging station costs  these variables also affect estimated ghg abatement costs  which are highly relevant as carbon pricing is being introduced in the province   c  2017 elsevier ltd  all rights reserved  
 life history oriented residential location choice model  a stress based two tier panel modeling approach this paper presents a life history oriented modeling framework to investigate residential location decisions as a two tier process of location search and location choice  in the first tier  a stress based location search model is developed by assuming that households search for a new location due to continual stress at different life domains  the search model adopts a fuzzy logic based modeling method that mimics the inter dependencies between push and pull factors  in the second tier  a location choice model is developed that accommodates how location decisions interact with life cycle events at different life domains  the model utilizes a latent segmentation based logit modeling technique to address the panel effect of the households  housing career  the model results suggest that households in general show preference for larger lots  and locations closer to work place  transit stop  and health service  location choice is found to be significantly influenced by the life cycle events as well as the lead and lagged effects  for example  the birth of a child magnifies the need of larger lots  the life history effects  however vary across two segments  suburbanite households in segment two prefer larger lots following a job change  whereas  urbanite households in segment one show a negative relationship  the adjustment period for a job change is longer than that of addition of a new job  a longer adjustment time is also found in the case of the first time vehicle purchase than acquisition of a vehicle  presence of children influences suburbanite households to reside closer to work place  urbanite households with children prefer to live closer to school   c  2017 elsevier ltd  all rights reserved  
 life satisfaction  well being and safe driving behaviour in undergraduate psychology students this study used measures of three self reported orientations to happiness  engagement  meaning  and pleasure   to examine whether any of the them related to the number of self reported unwanted driving incidences  crashes  near misses and traffic fines   one hundred and sixty undergraduate psychology students on a valid new zealand driver licence were required to fill in the  good life  questionnaire and complete a demographics questionnaire in regard to their age  gender  driving experience and number of unwanted incidences in the previous 12 months  the results showed that the happiness orientations of meaning and engagement correlated negatively and strongly with the number of incidences the drivers experienced in the previous year  the dimension of pleasure  however  indicated a positive correlation  revealing that the higher the participants rated on that dimension  the more likely they had unwanted driving incidences  a hierarchical multiple regression analysis indicated first that mileage  gender and age groups accounted for a significant 30  of the variance in the number of unwanted incidences on step 2  the variable  meaning   having revealed the strongest correlation with the number of incidences  was added to the regression equation and accounted for an additional and significant 21  of the variance in the number of incidences  finally  on step 3  the variable  intention to commit traffic violations  accounted for a further 13  of the incidences  the results indicate that high levels of happiness relating to life satisfaction and well being  facilitate pro social and adaptive behaviour and seem to safeguard drivers against committing deliberate traffic violations that would put them at serious risk   c  2017 elsevier ltd  all rights reserved  
 life course data reconstruction using complementary information taken from linked lives recently  research on travel behaviour has focused on life course and socialisation effects  as residential decisions are considered to be long term decisions which affect daily travel behaviour significantly  knowledge of residential experiences made over the life course may lead to a deeper understanding of later residential decisions and thus travel behaviour  quantitative retrospective surveys are carried out to gather this information  these studies deal with missing information on particular life stages  e g  childhood  this paper shows a new methodological approach for quantitative studies  illustrating how such missing life course data can be reconstructed using complementary information taken from linked lives  the data used have been retrospectively collected from a sample of spatial planning students at tu dortmund university  their parents and grandparents  the parents  residential biography from birth until the setting up of a household of their own is reconstructed using information from the grandparents  the reconstructed data are compared with the statements the parents made for the relevant life stages  thus testing how well the reconstruction worked  the results show that the reconstruction works better for the mothers  than fathers  using the grandmothers  information  rather than the grandfathers    the findings also indicate that the reconstruction is more or less successful for various types of reconstructed data  the paper concludes with guidelines for future data reconstruction   c  2017 elsevier ltd  all rights reserved

 light rail leads to more walking around station areas areas around light rail transit  lrt  stations offer ideal conditions for transit oriented development  tod   relatively dense  mixed use neighborhoods can have positive impacts on mobility  health  and perceptions of neighborhood safety among nearby residents  primarily through walking activity for both transit and other purposes  to examine how station areas may attract new activity  this study analyzed changes in walking around station areas among people living close to an lrt station before and after the opening of a new transit system  this study examined walking behavior among the subset of 214 participants living within one mile of one of 13 lrt stations from among a sample of residents living close or further away from a new lrt line in seattle  they completed a survey and a travel log and wore an accelerometer and a gps for 7 days both before  2008  and after the opening of the seattle area lrt  2010   walking bouts were derived using a previously developed algorithm  the main outcome was the individual level change in the proportion of daily walking within one quarter euclidean mile of an lrt station  overall walking decreased from before to after the lrt opening while station area walking did not change significantly  indicating a shift in walking activity to the station areas after the introduction of lrt  increases in the proportion of station area walking were negatively related to participants  distance between home and the nearest lrt station  peaking at  0 25 mile and decaying beyond   0 75 mile  male gender  college education  normal weight status  less access to cars  and frequent lrt use were also significantly associated with greater positive changes in the proportion of station area walking  the shift in walking to station areas after the completion of light rail provides evidence that the local proximate population is attracted to station areas  which may potentially benefit both transit use and tod area economic activity  the residential catchment area for the shift in lrt area walking was   0 75 mile of the lrt stations   c  2017 elsevier ltd all rights reserved  
 light rail transit cost performance  opportunities for future proofing the cost performance of light rail transit  lrt  systems have been scrutinized by the popular press and public sector infrastructure agencies as they have been prone to incurring cost increases in their capital expenditures  capex   in tackling such increases  emphasis is placed on mitigating strategic misrepresentation and optimism bias  which has hindered the public sectors ability to embrace innovation  particularly with regard to the justification and adoption of lrt  more often than not  operational expenditure  opex  is neglected  and is not considered a part of the transportation cost performance literature  the aim of this paper is to examine the equivocality that surrounds the determination of cost performance of lrt projects  it is suggested that the public sector should move beyond focusing on strategic misrepresentation and optimism bias  as many governments worldwide now have in place mechanisms to address such issues  and instead focus on future proofing their assets  it is suggested that the key enablers of future proofing lrt are  1  private finance   2  delivery strategy  e g  design build finance operate    3  digitization  e g  building information modelling   and  4  asset management  e g  smart technologies   if the public sector is to provide an lrt system that is cost effective and able to respond to the demands imposed by climate change  then it needs to be considered from a life cycle perspective and funding sought from the private sector to ensure its viability   c  2017 elsevier ltd  all rights reserved  
 limits to air travel growth  the case of infrequent flyers most air travel forecasts predict a long term rise in demand  with limited consideration of any limits to growth  however for any given population there will be those who have not flown recently   infrequent flyers    as well as non flyers  and little is known about these and whether they are likely to fly in the future  the aim of this paper is to analyse the characteristics of these groups and the reasons for their travel habits  using the uk as a case study  the findings show that infrequent flyers make up a heterogeneous consumer group whose non flying is influenced more by budget constraints and personal circumstances than specific aviation factors  comparisons with belgian  german and dutch infrequent flyers indicate some similarities  although there are differences in the relative importance of the reasons for not flying  the findings have implications for the aviation industry and regulators  and policy areas related to consumers and climate change   c  2017 elsevier ltd  all rights reserved

 longitudinal evaluation of travel and health outcomes in relation to new bicycle infrastructure  sydney  australia bacicground  this study sought to evaluate the health and transport impacts of urban bicycle infrastructure for transport through a commuting corridor in sydney  australia  methods  an online survey and seven day travel diary collected health and travel data from intervention area residents  and residents of a control area with similar characteristics and distance from the city  at baseline  n   846   and follow up  four months  wave 2  n   512  and 16 months  wave 3  n   418  post construction  multilevel regression modelling was used to compare changes over time with distance from the cycleway  results  in wave 3 24 5  of the intervention group reported using the new cycleway  residents who started using the cycleway predominantly lived within 1 km of the cycleway  62    however 13  of users in wave 3 lived more than 3 km from the cycleway  frequent cycling  weekly  was strongly associated with use of the cycleway  p   0 001   and remained consistent between waves 2 and 3  p   0 3   changes in cycling frequency associated with distance from the cycleway were observed over time  specifically  those who lived 1 00 2 99 km from the cycleway increased their weekly cycling  compared with those either closer to or further from the cycleway  p   0 08   these findings were replicated in a smaller sample of cyclists who recorded minutes week cycling  p   0 007   improved social capital was observed in the intervention group over time  however  changes in physical activity and quality of life were not observed within the time period  conclusions  cycling participation has been decreasing in sydney and australia in recent years  however  urban bicycle transport infrastructure can have a positive impact on cycling  particularly urban cycling for transport  and has the potential to improve health and transport outcomes for city residents  
 looking forward to safer hgvs  the impact of mirrors on driver reaction times heavy goods vehicle  hgv  collisions are responsible for a disproportionate number of urban vulnerable road user casualties  vru cyclists and pedestrians   blind spots to the front and side of hgvs can make it difficult  sometimes impossible  to detect close proximity vrus and may be the cause of some collisions  the current solution to this problem is to provide additional mirrors that can allow the driver to see into the blind spots  however  keeping track of many mirrors requires frequent off road glances which can be difficult to execute during demanding driving situations  one suggestion is that driving safety could be improved by redesigning cabs in order to reduce remove blind spot regions  with the aim of reducing the need for mirrors  and increasing detection rates  and thereby reducing collisions   to examine whether mirrors delay driver responses we created a series of simulated driving tasks and tested regular car drivers and expert hgv drivers  first we measured baseline reaction times to objects appearing when not driving   parked    participants then repeated the task whilst driving through a simulated town  primary driving tasks were steering  braking  and following directional signs   driving slowed reaction dines to objects visible in mirrors but not to objects visible through the front windscreen  in a second experiment cognitive load was increased  this slowed rts overall but did not alter the pattern of responses across windows and mirrors  crucially  we demonstrate that the distribution of mirror rts can be captured simply by the mirror s spatial position  eccentricity   these findings provide robust evidence that drivers are slower reacting to objects only visible in eccentric mirrors compared to direct viewing through the front windscreen

 macro level vulnerable road users crash analysis  a bayesian joint modeling approach of frequency and proportion this study aims at contributing to the literature on pedestrian and bicyclist safety by building on the conventional count regression models to explore exogenous factors affecting pedestrian and bicyclist crashes at the macroscopic level  in the traditional count models  effects of exogenous factors on non motorist crashes were investigated directly  however  the vulnerable road users  crashes are collisions between vehicles and non motorists  thus  the exogenous factors can affect the non motorist crashes through the non motorists and vehicle drivers  to accommodate for the potentially different impact of exogenous factors we convert the non motorist crash counts as the product of total crash counts and proportion of non motorist crashes and formulate a joint model of the negative binomial  nb  model and the logit model to deal with the two parts  respectively  the formulated joint model is estimated using non motorist crash data based on the traffic analysis districts  tads  in florida  meanwhile  the traditional nb model is also estimated and compared with the joint model  the result indicates that the joint model provides better data fit and can identify more significant variables  subsequently  a novel joint screening method is suggested based on the proposed model to identify hot zones for non motorist crashes  the hot zones of non  motorist crashes are identified and divided into three types  hot zones with more dangerous driving environment only  hot zones with more hazardous walking and cycling conditions only  and hot zones with both  it is expected that the joint model and screening method can help decision makers  transportation officials  and community planners to make more efficient treatments to proactively improve pedestrian and bicyclist safety  
 macroscopic modelling and robust control of bi modal multi region urban road networks the paper concerns the integration of a bi modal macroscopic fundamental diagram  mfd  modelling for mixed traffic in a robust control framework for congested single and multi region urban networks  the bi modal mfd relates the accumulation of cars and buses and the outflow  or circulating flow  in homogeneous  both in the spatial distribution of congestion and the spatial mode mixture  bi modal traffic networks  we introduce the composition of traffic in the network as a parameter that affects the shape of the bi modal mfd  a linear parameter varying model with uncertain parameter the vehicle composition approximates the original nonlinear system of aggregated dynamics when it is near the equilibrium point for single  and multi region cities governed by bi modal mfds  this model aims at designing a robust perimeter and boundary flow controller for single  and multi region networks that guarantees robust regulation and stability  and thus smooth and efficient operations  given that vehicle composition is a slow time varying parameter  the control gain of the robust controller is calculated off line using convex optimisation  to evaluate the proposed scheme  an extensive simulation based study for single and multi region networks is carried out  to this end  the heterogeneous network of san francisco where buses and cars share the same infrastructure is partitioned into two homogeneous regions with different modes of composition  the proposed robust control is compared with an optimised pre timed signal plan and a single region perimeter control strategy  results show that the proposed robust control can significantly   i  reduce the overall congestion in the network   ii  improve the traffic performance of buses in terms of travel delays and schedule reliability  and   iii  avoid queues and gridlocks on critical paths of the network   c  2017 the authors  published by elsevier ltd  
 macroscopic urban dynamics  analytical and numerical comparisons of existing models large scale network modeling using the macroscopic fundamental diagram  mfd  is widely based on the single reservoir model  where the variation of the accumulation of circulating vehicles in the reservoir equals inflow minus outflow  however  inconsistent lags for information propagation between boundaries may be observed with this single accumulation based model  for example  outflow is reacting too fast when inflow varies rapidly  whereas this information should be carried by vehicles that are never driving faster than the free flow speed  to overcome this limitation  a trip based model has been recently proposed  but whose solution cannot be obtained analytically  in this paper we compare both models under piecewise linear mfd and a piece wise constant demand  these assumptions allow to establish the exact solution of the accumulation based model  and continuous approximations of the trip based model at any order using taylor series  moreover  a flexible event based simulation framework is implemented to solve the latter model  making it a promising tool to account for heterogeneity in distance traveled  thanks to these resolution schemes we are able to measure the inaccuracy of the accumulation based approach when the demand varies rapidly  and propose a validity domain for this model  other applications with different trip lengths and supply limitations are also discussed   c  2017 elsevier ltd  all rights reserved

 maintenance appointments in railway rolling stock rescheduling this paper addresses the railway rolling stock rescheduling problem  while taking maintenance appointments into account  after a disruption  the rolling stock of the disrupted passenger trains has to be rescheduled to restore a feasible rolling stock circulation  usually  a number of train units have a scheduled maintenance appointment during the day  these appointments must be taken into account while rescheduling the rolling stock  in this paper we propose three mixed integer programming models for this purpose  all models are extensions of the composition model from the literature  which does not distinguish individual train units  the extra unit type model adds an additional rolling stock type for each train unit that requires maintenance  the shadow account model keeps track of a shadow account for each train unit that requires maintenance  the job composition model creates a path for each train unit such that the train units that require maintenance are on time for their maintenance appointments  all models are tested on instances of netherlands railways  the results show that especially the shadow account model and the job composition model are effectively able to take maintenance appointments into account during real time rescheduling  it depends on the characteristics of an instance whether the shadow account model or the job composition model performs best

 managing disruptions in the multi depot vehicle scheduling problem we consider two types of disruptions arising in the multi depot vehicle scheduling  the delays and the extra trips  these disruptions may or may not occur during operations  and hence they need to be indirectly incorporated into the planned schedule by anticipating their likely occurrence times  we present a unique recovery method to handle these potential disruptions  our method is based on partially swapping two planned routes in such a way that the effect on the planned schedule is minimal  if these disruptions are actually realized  the mathematical programming model for the multi depot vehicle scheduling problem  which incorporates these robustness considerations  possesses a special structure  this special structure causes the conventional column generation method fall short as the resulting problem grows also row wise when columns are generated  we design an exact simultaneous column and row generation algorithm to find a valid lower bound  the novel aspect of this algorithm is the pricing subproblem  which generates pairs of routes that form recovery solutions  compromising on exactness  we modify this algorithm in order to enable it to solve practical sized instances efficiently  this heuristic algorithm is shown to provide very tight bounds on the randomly generated instances in a short computation time   c  2017 elsevier ltd  all rights reserved

 mapping transit accessibility  possibilities for public participation the value of accessibility concepts is well established in transportation literature  but so is the low adoption of accessibility based instruments by practitioners  based on the premise that leveraging accessibility concepts to address public involvement challenges could promote their adoption in planning practice  this research investigates mechanisms to promote social learning among participants in public workshops  potential mechanisms of learning include specific tool based interactions and how such interactions reinforce structures of learning such as alignment and imagination  this paper details iterative testing of these mechanisms with a tool called coaxs  short for collaborative accessibility based stakeholder engagement system   through focus groups and exploratory workshops  a mixed methods analysis of the workshops supports the expectation that alignment and imagination correlate positively with social learning  as measured by reported teaming and dialog quality  specific interactions with the accessibility based features of coaxs in turn correlate positively with alignment and imagination  at individual and group levels of analysis  these findings  while not robustly generalizable  suggest that effective targeted stakeholder engagement for public transport can be structured around collaborative accessibility mapping  adoption for broader public participation requires further development  especially the incorporation of actual day to day experiences such as unreliable operations   c  2017 elsevier ltd  all rights reserved  
 marpem  an agent based model to explore the effects of policy instruments on the transition of the maritime fuel system away from hfo to lower the emissions of deep sea shipping  policymakers aim to decrease the use of heavy fuel oil  hfo  as a maritime fuel  multiple alternatives for hfo exist  but despite new regulations  their use is still limited  to stimulate shipping companies to replace hfo by one of the alternatives  policymakers can use a variety of policy instruments  in this paper  we present a comprehensive system perspective of the maritime fuel system and agent based model  marpem  that can be used to study the effects of policy instruments on the transition away from hfo  in contrast to existing studies on reducing maritime emissions  our system perspective captures the relations and dynamics between different components of the maritime fuel system  thereby  it can account for the feedback and non linear dynamics in the system  we illustrate the use of marpem to assess the effect of three policy instruments that each influence the maritime fuel system differently  the outcomes of the experiments are in line with previous studies and the opinion of industrial experts  the model is thus a valid representation of the maritime fuel system  by presenting a sufficiently detailed representation of the marine fuel socio technical system  listing clear and detailed assumptions  and publishing the source code  future studies can use this work as basis to study the effects of other policy instruments  thereby  this research enables future detailed studies of the maritime fuel system s transition   c  2017 published by elsevier ltd  
 measuring connectivity in the air freight industry in this paper  we present an air transport connectivity model for air freight  for the purposes of this paper  connectivity is defined as all possible direct and indirect connections to or from an airport operated by wide body aircraft  weighted for the quality of the connection in terms of transhipment and in flight times  using this model  we analyse the networks of seven european airports  europe s largest hub airports carry most air freight thanks to their extensive intercontinental passenger networks  while smaller airports with a strong focus on air freight carry large amounts of cargo on dedicated freighter aircraft  for air freight operations  the catchment area of an airport is much larger than it is for passenger services  as shipments are being trucked to their departure airport throughout all of mainland europe  since there are many airports sharing the same catchment area  potential competition for air freight is fierce  we found that well located regions between the four large european airports have access to large air freight networks  whilst regional air freight connectivity in northern and southern parts of europe is substantially lower   c  2016 elsevier ltd  all rights reserved  
 measuring highway efficiency by a dea approach and the malmquist index a growing concern exists regarding the efficiency of public resources spent in transport infrastructures  in this paper  we measure the efficiency of seven highway projects in portugal over the past decade by means of a data envelopment analysis and the malmquist productivity and efficiency indices  we distinguish between technical and technological efficiency and find that most highways face a reduction over time in both types of efficiency  this reduction is mainly due to an increase in operating and maintenance costs  follow up investments  and a decline in traffic  some highways only experience a reduction in technological efficiency after a decrease in traffic  they compensate with cost controls and stable investments  while controlling for scale efficiencies  we find a lack of pure technical efficiency in highways that are not subject to a competitive environment  which produces a lack of incentives for better management  not only does evidence exist of poor management due to a lack of competition  but the increased use of outsourcing also increases inefficiencies  the introduction of tolls and the outburst of the economic crisis in portugal have substantially reduced traffic that further contributes to inefficiency  the local context  such as highways in low income areas and rural regions with a lower traffic density  also affects highway performance  
 measuring information demand of a dynamic in vehicle display while driving   a study evaluating the mars  masking action relevant stimuli  method the mars  masking action relevant stimuli  method assesses information demand for dynamic stimuli while driving  an action relevant stimulus is masked and the driver presses a button to unmask the stimulus for a limited period  we interpreted button presses as information demand  following our previous research  rittger  kiesel  schmidt    maag  2014   the current study further evaluates the method  we applied the mars method to a dynamic in vehicle display containing recommendations from a traffic light assistant  in a driving simulator  drivers approached intersections with different traffic light phasing  the display either presented simple or complex information  in half of the drives  the participants used the mars method  the study had a full within subjects design and fixations were recorded in all conditions  the results showed that the information demand varied according to the information in the display and the traffic light phase  a comparison of button presses with fixations showed that one unmasking interval came along with one fixation on the display  as a conclusion  the mars method can distinguish between conditions with high and low information demand for the display  button presses relate to fixations on the display  hence  the mars method is a promising tool to assess the information demand in dynamic environments and can be applied as an extension or alternative for eye tracking   c  2017 elsevier ltd  all rights reserved  
 measuring the driver s perception error in the traffic accident risk evaluation the perception of risk  as the expectation of being involved in a traffic accident  is evaluated mainly in a subjective manner being perceptions as highly individual  and depending on experiences with accidents  however  both individual driver characteristics and driving behaviour entail certain perception errors in the risk level evaluation  as a consequence  drivers are very often not aware of the actual risk they are taking  for this aim  the paper presents a methodology for measuring the driver s perception error in the traffic accidents risk level evaluation based on the comparison between a measure of the risk perception subjectively obtained  and an objective measure obtained from kinematic parameters defining the driving style  starting from a procedure that describes the relationship between lateral and longitudinal accelerations and speeds  we classified car drivers  behaviour as safe or unsafe  then  we defined three levels of risk of being involved in a road accident  low  medium  and high risk   the subjective measure of the risk perception is obtained by the judgements of drivers regarding their driving behaviour

 measuring the long distance accessibility of italian cities long distance accessibility is a crucial element for economic development and for territorial cohesion  to be revealing  however  a measure of accessibility must not only consider the distance or travel time of a single mode  but should include the fares  the frequency and the interchanges of all available modes  the paper aims to address whether and where there is an accessibility problem between italian regions  through a comprehensive measure of accessibility covering the entire italian territory  the measure used in the paper is potential accessibility  with an exponential decay impedance function  different from similar studies  this one gives a more in depth definition of impedance parameters due to the availability of a transport model that includes the entire italian long distance supply  roads  coaches  long distance rail services  air services  and ferries   the opportunities at destination are proxied by population  and private and public sector employees  the main outputs are detailed maps of accessibility that are significantly more realistic than using simple infrastructure indicators or single mode measures  in addition  some policy conclusions are drawn in terms of past and future investment policies  
 measuring the sustainability of marine fuels  a fuzzy group multi criteria decision making approach the use of alternative energy sources instead of hfo has been recognized as a promising way for reducing emissions from shipping and promoting the development of green shipping  however  it is usually difficult for the decision making to select the best choice among multiple alternative marine fuels  in order to address this  a complete criteria system for sustainability assessment of alternative marine fuels was firstly established  and a fuzzy group multi criteria decision making method has been developed to rank the alternative marine fuels by combining fuzzy logarithmic least squares and fuzzy topsis  technique for order performance by similarity to ideal solution   fuzzy logarithmic least squares method has been employed to determine the weights of the criteria for sustain ability assessment  and fuzzy topsis was employed to determine the sustainability order of the alternatives  an illustrative case with three alternative marine fuels including methanol  lng and hydrogen has been studied by the proposed method  and hydrogen has been recognized as the most sustainable scenario  follows by lng  and methanol in the descending order  the results show that the proposed method is feasible for prioritizing the alternative marine fuels  it also has the ability to help the decision makers to select the most sustainable option among multiple marine fuels   c  2017 elsevier ltd  all rights reserved  
 measuring tod around transit nodes   towards tod policy transit oriented development  tod  can stimulate sustainable development by improving the interaction between transit and the surrounding development  planning for tod around existing transit nodes can only be effective if the assessment of the base situation is done properly  to do so  we propose a methodology to quantitatively measure existing levels of tod in terms of a tod index  within walkable distance of a transit node  by measuring various criteria that define tod  the value of a tod index indicates the level to which tod supporting characteristics are inplace around a transit node and what may be required to be improved so as to attain better transit orientation of thedevelopment  with these results in hand  tod planning proposals can become more accurate by targeting investments on the most relevant or critical factors  the methodology was applied to the city region of arnhem and nijmegen  the netherlands  a tod index was calculated for areas around the 21 train stations in the region  the results help in drawing tod policy for the region by identifying which station areas need more attention than others and at the same time  for each station  identifying specific tod characteristic s  that need improvement  
 measuring trends in household expenditures for daily mobility  the case in lyon  france  between 1995 and 2015 there are very few suitable databases for an in depth analysis of changes in the expenditures of households for their daily mobility  despite the fact that the increase in fuel costs in the years following 2000 raised questions concerning the vulnerability of certain households in light of their dependence on cars  this article uses three consecutive surveys on household transportation carried out in the lyon urban area in france in 1995  2006 and 2015  we propose a technique to extract consistent data on household expenses from the three surveys  changes are then analysed  taking care to distinguish between changes in prices  population structure and mobility behaviour  the results reveal trends that diverge widely during the two periods between the surveys  in addition  significant differences appear in the changes in expenditure levels and structure depending on the location of households  finally  a transition to reduced car use has become very clear  however significant generational effects produce contrasting results in young and retired households

 mechanisms underlying cognitive conspicuity in the detection of cyclists by car drivers objective  the aim of this study was to evaluate the visibility of cyclists for motorists in a simulated car driving task  background  in several cases involving collisions between cars and cyclists  car drivers failed to detect the latter in time to avoid collision because of their low conspicuity  method 2 groups of motorists  29 2 years old   including 12 cyclist motorists and 13 non cyclist motorists  performed a vulnerable road user detection task in a car driving simulator  they had to detect cyclists and pedestrians in an urban setting and evaluate the realism of the cyclists  the traffic  the city  the infrastructure  the car driven and the situations  cyclists appeared in critical situations derived from previous accounts given by injured cyclists and from cyclists  observations in real life situations  cyclist s levels of visibility for car drivers were either high or low in these situations according to the cyclists  results  realism scores were similar and high in both groups  cyclist motorists had fewer collisions with cyclists and detected cyclists at a greater distance in all situations  irrespective of cyclist visibility  several mechanisms underlying the cognitive conspicuity of cyclists for car drivers were considered  conclusion  the attentional selection of a cyclist in the road environment during car driving depends on top down processing  application  we consider the practical implications of these results for the safety of vulnerable road users and future directions of research  
 meta analysis of the effect of road work zones on crash occurrence there is strong evidence that work zones pose increased risk of crashes and injuries  the two most common risk factors associated with increased crash frequencies are work zone duration and length  however  relevant research on the topic is relatively limited  for that reason  this paper presents formal meta analyses of studies that have estimated the relationship between the number of crashes and work zone duration and length  in order to provide overall estimates of those effects on crash frequencies  all studies presented in this paper are crash prediction models with similar specifications  according to the meta analyses and after correcting for publication bias when it was considered appropriate  the summary estimates of regression coefficients were found to be 0 1703 for duration and 0 862 for length  these effects were significant for length but not for duration  however  the overall estimate of duration was significant before correcting for publication bias  separate meta analyses on the studies examining both duration and length was also carried out in order to have rough estimates of the combined effects  the estimate of duration was found to be 0 953  while for length was 0 847  similar to previous meta analyses the effect of duration after correcting for publication bias is not significant  while the effect of length was significant at a 95  level  meta regression findings indicate that the main factors influencing the overall estimates of the beta coefficients are study year and region for duration and study year and model specification for length  
 metafrontier analysis on productivity for west coast of south pacific terminals this paper measures productivity of port terminals in peru and chile  and evaluates the influence of the certain specific explanatory variables that may explain their differences in productivity  in the first stage  a dea malmquist model in a metafrontier framework is used to obtain the productivity scores  this approach lets us take the possible technological differences among the port terminals into account  in the second stage  an arellano bond model was estimated  to explain the differences in productivity change  the empirical evidence shows that the class 1 terminals produce output under certain less favourable technological conditions than  the class 2 terminals  moreover  on average  both classes present positive evolutions of the catching up effect  which shows that the terminals as a whole are moving nearer to the efficiency metafrontier  we also observe a technological regress during 2004 2014 and that the terminals have been affected by the financial crisis which started in the united states in 2008  finally  we identified that the container bulk rate and that private management contribute positively to the change in productivity  whereas the bulk rate and the total factor productivity change lagged contribute negatively   c  2017 elsevier ltd  all rights reserved  
 mild cognitive impairment and driving  does in vehicle distraction affect driving performance  objectives  in vehicle distraction is considered to be an important cause of road accidents  drivers with mild cognitive impairment  mci   because of their attenuated cognitive resources  may be vulnerable to the effects of distraction  however  previous relevant research is lacking  the main objective of the current study was to explore the effect of in vehicle distraction on the driving performance of mci patients  by assessing their reaction time at unexpected incidents and accident probability  methods  thirteen patients with mci  age  64 5     7 2  and 12 cognitively intact individuals  age  60 0     7 7   all active drivers were introduced in the study  the driving simulator experiment included three distraction conditions   a   distracted driving   b  conversing with passenger and  c  conversing through a hand held mobile phone  results  the mixed anova models revealed a greater effect of distraction on mci patients  specifically  the use of mobile phone induced a more pronounced impact on reaction time and accident probability in the group of patients  as compared to healthy controls  on the other hand  in the driving condition  conversing with passenger  the interaction effects regarding reaction time and accident probability were not significant  notably  the aforementioned findings concerning the mci patients in the case of the mobile phone were observed despite the effort of the drivers to apply a compensatory strategy by reducing significantly their speed in this driving condition  conclusion  overall  the current findings indicate  for the first time  that a common driving practice  such as the use of mobile phone  may have a detrimental impact on the driving performance of individuals with mci

 mitigating the impact of errors in travel time reporting on mode choice modelling travel time is a major component in understanding travel demand  however  the quantification of demand and forecasting hinges on understanding how travel time is perceived and reported  travel time reporting is typically subject to errors and this paper focuses on the mitigation of their impact on choice models  the aim is to explain the origin of these errors by including elements of travel behaviour  e g   activities during the trip   which have been shown to significantly affect mode choices and commuting satisfaction  based on responses from a revealed preferences survey  we estimate a mode choice model that treats travel time as a latent variable and incorporates different sources of data along with information on travel activities  employing these multiple   sometimes incongruent   sources of information in the choice model appears to be beneficial  results from comparing a logit model assuming error free inputs and the integrated hybrid model revealed significant impacts on the generated policy scenarios  the model results also contributed to identifying the main travel activity features that affect travel time reporting  providing indications that can assist in understanding and mitigating the impact of imprecise measurements  
 mixed equilibria with common constraints on transportation networks this study concerns about modeling the mixed equilibrium  me  problem  including user equilibrium  system optimum  and cournot nash players  with general common constraints  ccs  on transportation networks  the ccs capture the interactions of the decision variables of different players in me  which could be internal interactions such as road link capacity constraints or external such as emission or congestion control policies  it is shown that me with ccs can be modeled as a generalized nash equilibrium problem  gnep   the study proves that  under certain conditions  the gnep based me is jointly convex  which can be reformulated as a variational inequality  vi   we then study the solution existence  uniqueness and solving method for the vi based model  followed by a discussion on its potential applications  numerical tests are conducted with common nonlinear link emission constraints as the ccs on a simple two node  three link network first  and then on the nguyen dupus network  the results show that modeling users  route choice behavior with ccs is more general in evaluating system performance  planning link capacities  and making congestion or emission control related policies  
 mobile phone conversations  listening to music and quiet  electric  cars  are traffic sounds important for safe cycling  listening to music or talking on the phone while cycling as well as the growing number of quiet  electric  cars on the road can make the use of auditory cues challenging for cyclists  the present study examined to what extent and in which traffic situations traffic sounds are important for safe cycling  furthermore  the study investigated the potential safety implications of limited auditory information caused by quiet  electric  cars and by cyclists listening to music or talking on the phone  an internet survey among 2249 cyclists in three age groups  16 18  30 40 and 65 70 year old  was carried out to collect information on the following aspects  1  the auditory perception of traffic sounds  including the sounds of quiet  electric  cars  2  the possible compensatory behaviours of cyclists who listen to music or talk on their mobile phones  3  the possible contribution of listening to music and talking on the phone to cycling crashes and incidents  age differences with respect to those three aspects were analysed  results show that listening to music and talking on the phone negatively affects perception of sounds crucial for safe cycling  however  taking into account the influence of confounding variables  no relationship was found between the frequency of listening to music or talking on the phone and the frequency of incidents among teenage cyclists  this may be due to cyclists  compensating for the use of portable devices  listening to music or talking on the phone whilst cycling may still pose a risk in the absence of compensatory behaviour or in a traffic environment with less extensive and less safe cycling infrastructure than the dutch setting  with the increasing number of quiet  electric  cars on the road  cyclists in the future may also need to compensate for the limited auditory input of these cars  
 mobile phone use during driving  effects on speed and effectiveness of driver compensatory behaviour this study analysed and modelled the effects of conversation and texting  each with two difficulty levels  on driving performance of indian drivers in terms of their mean speed and accident avoiding abilities  and further explored the relationship between speed reduction strategy of the drivers and their corresponding accident frequency  100 drivers of three different age groups  young  mid age and old age  participated in the simulator study  two sudden events of indian context  unexpected crossing of pedestrians and joining of parked vehicles from road side  were simulated for estimating the accident probabilities  generalized linear mixed models approach was used for developing linear regression models for mean speed and binary logistic regression models for accident probability  the results of the models showed that the drivers significantly compensated the increased workload by reducing their mean speed by 2 62 m s and 5 29 m s in the presence of conversation and texting tasks respectively  the logistic models for accident probabilities showed that the accident probabilities increased by 3 and 4 times respectively when the drivers were conversing or texting on a phone during driving  further  the relationship between the speed reduction patterns and their corresponding accident frequencies showed that all the drivers compensated differently  but  among all the drivers  only few drivers  who compensated by reducing the speed by 30  or more  were able to fully offset the increased accident risk associated with the phone use  
 mobile phone use while driving literary review this paper analysis published results of the research into the connection between mobile phone use while driving and traffic safety  ever since the introduction of the first mobile phones  the authors have been examining the risks associated with its use in traffic  namely  prevalence or frequency of mobile phone use while driving  characteristics of drivers who make more frequent use of mobile phones  the connection between mobile phone use while driving and a car crash risk  a link between mobile phone use while driving and perception of risk  effects on driving performance of using various modes of mobile phones while driving   hands free  or  hand held    psychological factors influencing driver s decision to use a mobile phone while driving  etc  it is important to point out that the results of some studies indicate that using a hands free mobile phone while driving does not provide greater safety as compared to the use of hand held mobile phones while driving  generally speaking  younger male drivers tend to use mobile phones more often while driving than women and older males  this paper analyses the results of studies which were published in 60 papers from 1994 to 2013  the analysis of the papers selected for research confirms detrimental effects of mobile phone use while driving  also  four phases in the process of understanding the issue of mobile phone use impacts while driving have been established or identified  the first phase gives the analysis of the prevalence or frequency of mobile phone use while driving  the second phase identifies the characteristics of drivers who tend to use mobile phones more frequently while driving  the third phase concerns research into impacts of using different modes of mobile phones while driving on driving performance   hands free  or  hand held    finally  the fourth phase deals with research into risks of mobile phone use while driving   hands free  or  hand held    the importance of this paper is reflected in that it can help traffic safety policy makers  on the basis of better understanding of the issue of mobile phone use impact while driving  to develop effective strategies aimed at reducing the extent of mobile phone use while driving   c  2017 elsevier ltd  all rights reserved  
 modal analysis of real time  real world vehicular exhaust emissions under heterogeneous traffic conditions this study presents the characteristics of real world  real time  on road vehicular exhaust emission namely  carbon monoxide  co   nitric oxide  no   hydrocarbons  hc   and carbon dioxide  co2  emitted under heterogeneous traffic conditions  field experiments were performed on major category of vehicles in developing countries  i e  two wheelers  auto rickshaws  cars and buses  the on board monitoring was carried out on different corridors with varying road geometry  results revealed that the driving cycle was dependent on the road geometry  with two lane mixed flow corridor having lot of short term events compared to that of arterial road  vehicular emissions during idling and cruising were generally low compared to emissions during acceleration  it was also found that emissions were significantly dependent on short term events such as rapid acceleration and braking during a trip  also  the standard emission models like copert and cmem under predicted the real world emissions by 30 200  depending upon different driving modes  the on road emissions measurements were able to capture the emission characteristics during the micro events of real world driving scenarios which were not represented by standard vehicle emission measured at laboratory conditions   c  2017 elsevier ltd  all rights reserved  
 mode valued differences of in vehicle travel time savings the value of in vehicle travel time savings  vt  estimated from mode choice models has been sometimes found to be higher for private car than for public transportation  this mode valued variation may seem paradoxical  if public transportation  especially the bus  is perceived as less pleasant than the private car  and because mode valued differences in the vt cannot be attributed to self selection  this article describes two alternative microeconomic explanations for this empirical finding  the first follows from noticing that the marginal consumption of goods may depend on travel time  but differently for each mode  a marginal reduction in travel time induces marginal savings in the consumption of goods like fuel or oil  but those marginal savings are perceived by the user only when conditioning on the use of the car  this effect can be explicitly accounted with the inclusion of technical constraints relating goods consumption and time assignment in the microeconomic framework of the vt  the second explanation follows from noticing that the activity schedule does not need to be the same conditional on the use of each mode  since the car is usually faster and more accessible  a schedule constructed conditional on the use of the car could be more complex  justifying higher values of time as a resource for that mode  the article finishes illustrating the proposed explanations with an example and then summarizing the contributions of this research and proposing lines for further investigation  
 model of an integrated air passenger information system and its adaptation to budapest airport air passengers use several functions of passenger information systems during their journeys  inadequate information management may generate uncertainties  experience shows that the quality of information provision can be improved by the integration of data sources and information services  development of increasingly integrated solutions requires the use of more abstract modelling methods  nevertheless  these complex methods have only been partially elaborated and are yet to be adequately published  therefore  our aim was to develop several methods for analysis and modelling  we applied an approach  where organisations  functions  data groups  and information terminals  interfaces  have been considered  all model components  service functions and their correspondences have been identified and visualised in matrix format  finally  our method is applied for the case of budapest airport  based on this research  useful subsystems  most notably integrated passenger mobile applications  may be developed in the future   c  2017 elsevier ltd  all rights reserved  
 modeling air travelers  choice of flight departure and return dates on long holiday weekends air travel demand is typically high on long holidays  understanding factors that influence the choice of air travelers with respect to their departure and return dates on long holidays can help airlines make effective decisions on pricing  ticket sales  and scheduling  we conduct a stated preference survey to examine the preferences of low cost airline travelers on a particular holiday weekend  a temporally correlated logit model is developed to account for the temporal correlation of day of the week alternatives  the results indicate that airfare is the key variable affecting air travel date choices  the utility of day alternatives decreases when more leave days are required before the holiday begins  departure dates before the beginning of the holiday weekend and return dates after the end of the holiday are highly substitutable  the low fare strategy comprising early departures and late returns can effectively increase the load factor of off peak flights on long holiday weekends   c  2017 elsevier ltd  all rights reserved  
 modeling airport capacity choice with real options this study models airport capacity choice when a real option for expansion can be purchased  facing demand uncertainty  an airport first determines the capacity for immediate investment  the prior capacity  and the size of the land or other resources to be reserved for possible future expansion  the reserve   once demand is observed  the airport can use a portion of the reserve to build extra capacity and set airport charge  our analytical results show that if demand uncertainty is low and capacity and reserve costs are relatively high  an airport will not acquire a real option for expansion  otherwise  it can use an expansion option to improve its expected profit or social welfare  both the magnitude of profit or welfare gain and the optimal size of the reserve increase with demand uncertainty  a higher reserve cost leads to a larger prior capacity and a smaller reserve  whereas a higher capital cost leads to lower prior capacity  a profit maximizing airport would choose a smaller prior capacity and reserve than would a welfare maximizing airport  competition within the airline market promotes airport capacity investment and the adoption of real options by profit maximizing airports  whereas airport commercial services increase prior capacity but not the reserve   c  2017 elsevier ltd  all rights reserved  
 modeling and managing morning commute with both household and individual travels this study investigates the morning commute problem with both household and individual travels  where the household travel is a shared ride of household  family  members  in particular  it considers the situation when a proportion of commuters have to drive their children to school first and then go to work  household travel   for household travel  departure time choice is a joint decision based on all household members  preferences  unlike the standard bottleneck model  the rush hour dynamic traffic pattern with mixed travelers  household travelers and individual travelers  varies with the numbers of individual travelers and households  as well as the schedule difference between school and work  given the numbers of individual travelers and households  we show that by appropriately coordinating the schedules of work and school  the traffic congestion at the highway bottleneck can be relieved  and hence the total travel cost can be reduced  this is because  departure arrival of individual and household travels can be separated by schedule coordination  system performance under schedule coordination is quantified in terms of the relative proportions of the two classes of travelers and is compared with the extreme case when the same desired arrival time applies to both schooling and working  furthermore  the efficiency of work and school schedule coordination in reducing travel cost is bounded  this efficiency is also compared with that at the system optimum where queuing is fully eliminated and schedule delay cost is minimized  achieved by a joint scheme of first best pricing and schedule coordination    c  2016 elsevier ltd  all rights reserved  
 modeling collusion proof port emission regulation of cargo handling activities under incomplete information this study models the emission regulation of a port s cargo handling activities when the regulatory government agency lacks complete information on the cost of reducing emissions for the port  the goal is to identify rules for determining the optimal port charge and capacity to allow port emissions to be regulated in an environment with incomplete information  we evaluate the effect of introducing a risk averse environmental monitor as a supervisor to provide the government with additional information  a signal  on the port operator s emission reduction cost  to prevent the environmental monitor from colluding with the port operator  we develop a collusion proof regulation scheme based on the principal agent theory  the scheme is modeled as a bi level problem faced by the government and the monitor  we find that  compared to the case with complete information  collusion proof regulation do not distort optimal port charges only when the port operator is efficient and has low emission reduction costs  when distortion does occur  it depends on the monitor s degree of risk aversion and the accuracy of the signal about emission reduction cost  besides  information asymmetry leads to less cargo throughput  a lower emission level  and reduced port capacity  such regulation induced downward distortion can be either alleviated or aggravated by the collusion proof regulation  depending on the quality of the information received by the environmental monitor  our theoretical models are tested using a case study based on container terminals in the port of shanghai  the numerical results suggest that a risk averse environmental monitor can improve port user s social welfare in the presence of imperfect information   c  2017 elsevier ltd  all rights reserved  
 modeling crash injury severity by road feature to improve safety objective  the objective of this research is 2 fold  to  a  model and identify critical road features  or locations  based on crash injury severity and compare it with crash frequency and  b  model and identify drivers who are more likely to contribute to crashes by road feature method  crash data from 2011 to 2013 were obtained from the highway safety information system  hsis  for the state of north carolina  twenty three different road features were considered  analyzed  and compared with each other as well as no road feature  a multinomial logit  mnl  model was developed and odds ratios were estimated to investigate the effect of road features on crash injury severity results  among the many road features  underpass  end or beginning of a divided highway  and on ramp terminal on crossroad are the top 3 critical road features  intersection crashes are frequent but are not highly likely to result in severe injuries compared to critical road features  roundabouts are least likely to result in both severe and moderate injuries  female drivers are more likely to be involved in crashes at intersections  4 way and t  compared to male drivers  adult drivers are more likely to be involved in crashes at underpasses  older drivers are 1 6 times more likely to be involved in a crash at the end or beginning of a divided highway conclusions  the findings from this research help to identify critical road features that need to be given priority  as an example  additional advanced warning signs and providing enlarged or highly retroreflective signs that grab the attention of older drivers may help in making locations such as end or beginning of a divided highway much safer  educating drivers about the necessary skill sets required at critical road features in addition to engineering solutions may further help them adopt safe driving behaviors on the road  
 modeling free floating car sharing use in switzerland  a spatial regression and conditional logit approach free floating car sharing has been one of the latest innovations in the car sharing market  it allows its customers to locate available vehicles via a smartphone app and reserve them for a short time prior to their rental  because it is available for point to point trips  free floating car sharing is not only an alternative to private cars  but also to public transportation  using spatial regression and conditional logit analysis of original transaction data of a free floating car sharing scheme in switzerland  this research shows that free floating car sharing is mainly used for discretionary trips  for which only substantially inferior public transportation alternatives are available  in contrast to station based car sharing  it does not rely on high quality local public transportation access  but bridges gaps in the existing public transportation network   c  2017 elsevier ltd  all rights reserved  
 modeling heterogeneous traffic flow  a pragmatic approach modeling dynamics of heterogeneous traffic flow is central to the control and operations of today s increasingly complex transportation systems  we develop a macroscopic heterogeneous traffic flow model  this model considers interplay of multiple vehicle classes  each of which is assumed to possess homogeneous car following behavior and vehicle attributes  we propose the concepts of road capacity split and perceived equivalent density for each class to model both lateral and longitudinal cross class interactions across neighboring cells  rather than leveraging hydrodynamic analogies  it establishes pragmatic cross class interaction rules aspired by capacity allocation and approximate inter cell fluxes  this model generalizes the classical cell transmission model  ctm  to three types of traffic regimes in general  i e  free flow  semi congestion  and full congestion regimes  this model replicates prominent empirical characteristics exhibited by mixed vehicular flow  including formation and spatio temporal propagation of shockwaves  vehicle overtaking  as well as oscillatory waves  those features are validated against numerical experiments and the ngsim 1 80 data  realistic class specific travel times can be computed from this model efficiently  which demonstrates the feasibility of applying this multi class model to large scale real world networks   c  2017 elsevier ltd  all rights reserved  
 modeling logistic systems with an agent based model and dynamic graphs this paper is about modeling and simulation of logistic systems  we define them as corridors established between a gateway port  where goods are imported  and urban areas  where the final distributors are located  the efficient management of the flow of goods operated on these corridors requires a structured territory and organized actors  decentralized decisions of actors and interactions between them make it possible to provide consistent logistic services despite the numerous system constraints  legal  environmental  economical         our goal is to reproduce the behavior of logistic systems through simulation  our approach consists of describing the dynamics of such a system at a micro level  therefore  we first enumerate the local properties  constraints and behaviors of each main actor and the infrastructures of this territory in order to extract the essential elements  that will be part of the theoretical model  a major aspect of the model is the description of the interface between maritime dynamics  schedule on a day basis  and metropolitan dynamics  scheduled on an hour basis   this interface is self organized  macro characteristics emerge from local properties and rules  it is revealing of a complex system  working on different scales  that we model with agents and dynamic graphs  each actor and infrastructure is represented with agents  the transportation network is a multi modal dynamic graph that makes possible to model the traffic and topology evolution  this approach enables users  like public authorities  to modify local parameters and observe their effects at the macro level  thus users can identify levers to control the whole system  we execute some simulations with data on the seine axis to confront our results with a real case study  we provide some measures  e g  number of vehicles and quantity of goods  to show that the simulation reproduces the atomization process of logistic flows  we propose a spatial analysis of the goods traffic within the transportation network and compare the effects of two replenishment strategies on the stock shortages  
 modeling pedestrian crossing speed profiles considering speed change behavior for the safety assessment of signalized intersections pedestrian safety is one of the most challenging issues in road networks  understanding how pedestrians maneuver across an intersection is the key to applying countermeasures against traffic crashes  it is known that the behaviors of pedestrians at signalized crosswalks are significantly different from those in ordinary walking spaces  and they are highly influenced by signal indication  potential conflicts with vehicles  and intersection geometries  one of the most important characteristics of pedestrian behavior at crosswalks is the possible sudden speed change while crossing  such sudden behavioral change may not be expected by conflicting vehicles  which may lead to hazardous situations  this study aims to quantitatively model the sudden speed changes of pedestrians as they cross signalized crosswalks under uncongested conditions  pedestrian speed profiles are collected from empirical data and speed change events are extracted assuming that the speed profiles are stepwise functions  the occurrence of speed change events is described by a discrete choice model as a function of the necessary walking speed to complete crossing before the red interval ends  current speed  and the presence of turning vehicles in the conflict area  the amount of speed change before and after the event is modeled using regression analysis  a monte carlo simulation is applied for the entire speed profile of the pedestrians  the results show that the model can represent the pedestrian travel time distribution more accurately than the constant speed model

 modeling vehicle miles traveled on local roads using classification roadway spatial structure this paper models the relationship between vehicle miles traveled  vmt  on local and collector roads with an objective to predict local road vmt by using collector road vmt  through a continuous approximation method typically used for vehicle routing  it first analytically reveals this relationship mainly as a function of roadway density ratios between multiple roadway classifications  this structural relationship suggests regression equations using density ratios or logarithmic values of them as the explanatory variables  the use of regression equations enables to account for varying spatial distributions of roadways and demand through parameter calibration  the proposed regression equations are proved good fits through computer simulation using distinct community road network topologies  in addition  practical data from hennepin county of minnesota  u s a  that encompasses minneapolis indicates that our developed regression equations can work well  
 modelling bus bunching and holding control with vehicle overtaking and distributed passenger boarding behaviour headway fluctuation and bus bunching are commonly observed in transit operations  while holding control is a proven strategy to reduce bus bunching and improve service reliability  a transit operator would benefit from an accurate forecast of bus propagation in order to effectively control the system  to this end  we propose an  ad hoc  bus propagation model taking into account vehicle overtaking and distributed passenger boarding  dpb  behaviour  the latter represents the dynamic passenger queue swapping among buses when bunching at bus stops occurs and where bus capacity constraints are explicitly considered  the enhanced bus propagation model is used to build the simulation environment where different holding control strategies are tested  a quasi first depart first hold  fdfh  rule is applied to the design of schedule  and headway based holding control allowing for overtaking  with the objective to minimise the deviation from the targeted headway  the effects of control strategies are tested in an idealised bus route under different operational setting and in a real bus route in guangzhou  we show that when the combined overtaking and queue swapping behaviour are considered  the control strategies can achieve better headway regularity  less waiting time and less on board travel time than their respective versions without overtaking and dpb  the benefit is even greater when travel time variability is higher and headway is smaller  suggesting that the control strategies are preferably deployed in high frequency service   c  2017 elsevier ltd  all rights reserved  
 modelling emission control taxes in port areas and port privatization levels in port competition and co operation sub games using a game theory approach  this paper analyses a situation in which the government imposes a certain emission tax on vessels and port operations for emission control in port areas  two ports are considered  a purely private port and a landlord  partial public  port  these two ports are in cournot or bertrand competition or cooperation with differentiated service  our model outcomes lead to the following conclusions  first  the optimal private level of port 2 under cournot and bertrand competitions varies between fully private and highly public concerned port  while government will prefer a highly public concerned or close to highly public concerned port in the cooperation scenario  second  government will have to make more and stricter efforts to enhance environmental protection in the situation of port cooperation  monopoly  than in the case of inter port competition  and all the optimal emission tax should be always lower than the marginal emission damage  third  port privatization has a non monotonous effect on ports  environmental damage in the inter port competition scenarios and a monotonous decreasing effect in the cooperation scenario  fourth  the total emission tax revenue is always higher than the overall environmental damage in the cooperative scenario  and it may or may not be able to cover the whole environment damage in cournot and bertrand competitions  finally  the government may face a trade off among environmental protection  maximizing social welfare  satisfying individual motivation  when considering port cooperation  monopoly   
 modelling sailing time and cost for inland waterway transport transport time and cost are decisive factors for shippers when they choose a mode for their transport  for inland waterway transport in particular  these aspects are more uncertain and less easy to generalize than for road and rail  this is due to the highly variable waterway conditions on free flowing rivers and due to the large variety of inland ships  today s transport models  however  do not take these factors into account  this paper shows that dynamic fairway conditions  the ship s amount of propulsion power  and the captain s behaviour have a substantial impact on the attainable speed and fuel consumption of inland ships  this in turn has a significant impact on attainable sailing schedules and transportation cost  as we demonstrate through a case study for ships sailing on the rhine danube corridor  we  therefore  conclude that there is a clear potential to improve the representation of inland waterway transport in freight models by modelling the effects of actual ship characteristics and waterway conditions at the micro level  
 modelling spatial access to general practitioner surgeries  does public transport availability matter  existing approaches investigating access to primary health care tend to use relatively crude measures that compare supply to demand ratios for administrative units or use gis to calculate straight line or network distances to the nearest facility  the latter however largely assume access is via private modes of transport  the aim of this paper is to investigate the impact of different modes of travel  car versus bus  on associations between different measures of general practitioner  gp  supply and area level deprivation and the percentage of elderly patients  multivariate regression techniques are employed to examine relationships between demand and potential accessibility to gp  services for different modes of travel for a study area in south wales  uk  accessibility measures are calculated using  traditional  gis based approaches and enhanced two step floating catchment area  e2sfca  techniques  findings suggest that  whilst the direction and strength of the association between deprivation and accessibility measures varies by mode of travel  the main differences are actually across measures of accessibility  this has important implications for studies of potential inequalities in health service accessibility and suggests there is a need to develop consistent measures of accessibility if we are to truly understand the relationship between demand and supply  such studies should ideally incorporate the availability of alternative modes of transport particularly in areas where there are vulnerable groups such as the elderly who are typically more dependent on public transportation to access health care services  
 modelling the asymmetric probabilistic delay of aircraft arrival the main purpose of this paper is to present an asymmetric logit probability model to estimate and predict the daily probabilities of delay in aircraft arrivals  the proposed model takes into account statistical regularity  noting that more arrivals are on time than delayed  thus reflecting an asymmetric pattern of behaviour  the data analysed were obtained from the bts and iata databases for december 2014  corresponding to delays within the us airspace system for each carrier  measured at various us airports  the model was evaluated by analysing both in sample and out of sample data  for main and control samples  the performance of the proposed asymmetric bayesian logit model was compared with that of two others  frequentist logit and symmetric bayesian logit  the main conclusion drawn is that the model we propose obtains the best fit  according to the statistics considered  and identifies a novel delaying factor  namely distance  which is not identified by the other models analysed   c  2017 elsevier ltd  all rights reserved  
 modelling the fuel consumption and pollutant emissions of the urban bus fleet of the city of madrid an integrated methodology to estimate the emissions of automotive vehicles is proposed in this work  with application to the vehicle fleet of madrid municipal transport company  the fleet composed of 2000 buses and 20 different types  operating 167 routes providing a service to the whole of the city of madrid  with 3 165 million inhabitants and over 404 million passengers in the year 2014  the results of the model have been validated by calculating the fuel consumption and comparing them with the actual consumption  as this is the only data that can be used by taking estimations that are external to the model  the errors found were small and acceptable  thus  the approach of this work has two features  it uses both measured transport activity data and vehicle activity data with specific emissions models for the calculation of consumption and emissions for a bus fleet based on an urban area  it also has two outcomes  it provides useful information for understanding where and how air pollutants are originated and it is a tool for designing intervention measures   c  2017 elsevier ltd  all rights reserved

 models for technology choice in a transit corridor with elastic demand we present two optimization models for a transit line under the assumption that the demand is elastic and can be approximated by a linear function of fare and passenger travel time components  these models can be used to strategically evaluate technology choices  we study the effect of demand elasticity on the technology choice by analytic and numerical comparison with some fixed demand models  we assume a range of objective functions having as two extrema the maximization of operator s profit and the maximization of social welfare  we show both analytically and numerically that accounting for demand elasticity does not change the conclusions that can be derived by an equivalent fixed demand model  this invariance holds for a broad range of objective functions in the elastic case  the significant difference between the two objective function extrema lies in the proportions of captured demand   c  2017 elsevier ltd  all rights reserved  
 monitoring driver fatigue using a single channel electroencephalographic device  a validation study by gaze based  driving performance  and subjective data driver fatigue can impair performance as much as alcohol does  it is the most important road safety concern  causing thousands of accidents and fatalities every year  thanks to technological developments  wearable  single channel eeg devices are now getting considerable attention as fatigue monitors  as they could help drivers to assess their own levels of fatigue and  therefore  prevent the deterioration of performance  however  the few studies that have used single channel eeg devices to investigate the physiological effects of driver fatigue have had inconsistent results  and the question of whether we can monitor driver fatigue reliably with these eeg devices remains open  here  we assessed the validity of a single channel eeg device  tgam based chip  to monitor changes in mental state  from alertness to fatigue   fifteen drivers performed a 2 h simulated driving task while we recorded  simultaneously  their prefrontal brain activity and saccadic velocity  we used saccadic velocity as the reference index of fatigue  we also collected subjective ratings of alertness and fatigue  as well as driving performance  we found that the power spectra of the delta eeg band showed an inverted u shaped quadratic trend  eeg power spectra increased  for the first hour and half  and decreased during the last thirty minutes   while the power spectra of the beta band linearly increased as the driving session progressed  coherently  saccadic velocity linearly decreased and speeding time increased  suggesting a clear effect of fatigue  subjective data corroborated these conclusions  overall  our results suggest that the tgam based chip eeg device is able to detect changes in mental state while performing a complex and dynamic everyday task as driving

 monitoring social network formation and information content analysis of transport anomalies  the case of airline crashes airliners  industry corresponds to an extremely sensitive and volatile sector  especially subject to information related to flight safety  possible negative publicity on such issues may result to sudden and abrupt fluctuations of air travel demand  accompanied with phenomena of panic or feelings of generalized insecurity  the proliferation of social media platforms that offer a direct and immediate two way communication channel contributes to the overall information propagation related to flights security  as exposed in the recent airlines crashes  and can be viewed as a proxy of the social network formation of such paradigms  the current paper aims to offer a framework for quantitatively analyzing social network formation  based on comprehensive network metrics  valuable in cases of commercial airliners accidents  moreover  the use of data from social media connectivity offers one more extremely valuable piece of information related to the messages that connected users exchange  mention or are exposed to  such large datasets are quantitatively analyzed here based on methods used in content analysis  exposing valuable information on the interest of the general public  potential airliners users  of anomalies in the airline industry  the analysis is based on data from two real events  airliners  crashes   which attracted the international public interest and significantly affected air travel demand  finally  the results are analyzed and presented in detail such as to contribute to the air demand treatment  especially in terms of optimal communication operational management in cases of crises   c  2017 elsevier ltd  all rights reserved  
 mood during commute in the netherlands what way of travel feels best for what kind of people  question  how happy we are depends partly on how we live our life and part of our way of life is the commute between home and work  in this context we are faced with the question of how much time spent on commuting is optimal happiness wise  and what means of transportation  since our personal experience is limited  it is helpful to draw on the experience of other people  of people like us in particular  earlier research  several cross sectional studies have found lower subjective wellbeing among long distance commuters and among users of public transportation  yet these differences could be due to selection effects  such as unhappy people ending up more often in distant jobs without having a car  still another limitation is that earlier research has focused on the average effect of commuting  rather than specifying what is optimal for whom  method  data of the dutch  gelukswijzer   happiness indicator  study were analyzed  in the context of which 5000 participants recorded both what they had done in the previous day and how happy they had felt during these activities  this data allows comparison between how the same person feels at home and during their commute  the number of participants is large enough to allow a split up between different kinds of people  in particular among the many well educated women who participated in this study  results  people feel typically less well when commuting than at home  and this negative difference is largest when commuting using public transportation and smallest when commuting by bike  it is not per se the commuting time that depresses mood  but specific combinations of commuting time and commuting mode  increasing commuting times can even lead to an uplift of mood when the commute is by bike or foot  split up by different kinds of people shows considerable differences  especially with regard to the different modes and company when travelling  optimal ways of commuting for different kinds of people are presented in a summary table  from which individuals can read what will fit them best  the differences illustrate that research focusing on averages will not help individuals to make a more informed choice with respect to commuting mode   c  2017 published by elsevier ltd  
 mountain railway alignment optimization with bidirectional distance transform and genetic algorithm various challenging constraints must be satisfied in railway alignment design for topographically complex mountainous regions  the alignment design for such environments is so challenging that existing methodologies have great difficulties in automatically generating viable railway alignment alternatives  we solve this problem with a hybrid method in which a bidirectional distance transform  dt  algorithm automatically selects control points before a genetic algorithm  ga  refines the alignment  this approach solves the problems of  1  determining the appropriate distribution of control points in the ga and  2  producing alignments that deviate significantly from the dt optimized paths  automatic design of backtracking curves and dynamic generation of vertical points of intersection handling multiple constraints are developed to improve the ga performance  this method has been applied to a real case on the sichuan tibet railway where excessively severe natural gradients must be overcome  it automatically finds an alignment optimized for the given objectives and complex constraints  as well as various promising alternatives  
 moving from monomodality to multimodality  changes in mode choice of new residents this paper analyses the interdependences between modal variability as part of everyday mobility and residential relocations  accordingly  the main research question to what extent the combination of travel modes changes after moving to another city  in discussing this  the paper is based on two conceptual assumptions  first  residential relocations are understood as biographical transitions within a mobility biography  second  in recent years there has been a trend towards multimodal transport systems  especially in big cities  comprising both the supply and demand of urban transport  we believe that this tendency towards multimodality varies by the overall mobility culture of a particular city  which is expressed  for example  by its car dependence or cycling friendliness  combining these findings we believe that people who move between cities representing different mobility cultures are likely to change their use and combination of travel modes  empirically  this assumption is scrutinized by surveying people who recently moved between the german cities of bremen  hamburg and the ruhr area and showed a monomodal mode choice before the relocation  n   449   one central finding of this study is that people who moved to a public transport or cycling friendly city are more likely to become multimodal than the ones who moved to auto oriented cities   c  2017 elsevier ltd  all rights reserved

 multilevel analysis of the role of human factors in regional disparities in crash outcomes a growing body of research has examined the disparities in road traffic safety among population groups and geographic regions  these studies reveal disparities in crash outcomes between people and regions with different socioeconomic characteristics  a critical aspect of the road traffic crash epidemic that has received limited attention is the influence of local characteristics on human elements that increase the risk of getting into a crash  this paper applies multilevel logistic regression modeling techniques to investigate the influence of driver residential factors on driver behaviors in an attempt to explain the area based differences in the severity of road crashes across the state of alabama  specifically  the paper reports the effects of characteristics attributable to drivers and the geographic regions they reside on the likelihood of a crash resulting in serious injuries  model estimation revealed that driver residence  postal code or region  accounted for about 7 3  of the variability in the probability of a driver getting into a serious injury crash  regardless of driver characteristics  the results also reveal disparities in serious injury crash rate as well as significant proportions of serious injury crashes involving no seatbelt usage  driving under influence  dui   unemployed drivers  young drivers  distracted driving  and african american drivers among some regions  the average credit scores  average commute times  and populations of driver postal codes are shown to be significant predictors for risk of severe injury crashes  this approach to traffic crash analysis presented can serve as the foundation for evidence based policies and also guide the implementation of targeted countermeasures  
 multilevel modelling of rutting progression for low volume roads to date  great efforts have been dedicated to develop pavement deterioration models for low volume roads  the reliability and usefulness of such models in a pavement management system stem from using accurate datasets with suitable modelling approaches  the aim of this study is to present an approach for developing absolute empirical deterioration models that are capable of capturing the effects of unobserved variables and correlation errors of time series data for same sections  multilevel regression analysis has been carried out to develop models for predicting pavement rutting progression as a function of a number of contributing variables  such as traffic loading  pavement strength  climate and drainage condition  this paper presents the modelling approach and developed rutting progression models  during the gradual phase  for two classes of low volume roads  the results indicate that the effect of time is greater than the other contributing factors on rutting progression  accuracy and reliability of the developed models are tested using simulation and validation  deterministic simulation has shown that the developed models can simulate rut depth values and progression rates reasonably well under different typical conditions  
 multiuse trail intersection safety analysis  a crowdsourced data perspective real and perceived concerns about cycling safety are a barrier to increased ridership in many cities  many people prefer to bike on facilities separated from motor vehicles  such as multiuse trails  however  due to underreporting  cities lack data on bike collisions  especially along greenways and multiuse paths  we used a crowdsourced cycling incident dataset  2005 2016  from bikemaps org for the capital regional district  crd   bc  canada  our goal was to identify design characteristics associated with unsafe intersections between multiuse trails and roads  92 8  of mapped incidents occurred between 2014 and 2016  we extracted both collision and near miss incidents at intersections from bikemaps org  we conducted site observations at 32 intersections where a major multiuse trail intersected with roads  we compared attributes of reported incidents at multiuse trail  road intersections to those at road  road intersections  we then used negative binomial regression to model the relationship between the number of incidents and the infrastructure characteristics at multiuse trail  road intersections  we found a higher proportion of collisions  38   or 17 45 total reports  at multiuse trail  road intersections compared to road  road intersections  23   or 62 268 total reports   a higher proportion of incidents resulted in an injury at multiuse trail  road intersections compared to road  road intersections  33  versus 15    cycling volumes  vehicle volumes  and trail sight distance were all associated with incident frequency at multiuse trail road intersections  supplementing traditional crash records with crowdsourced cycling incident data provides valuable evidence on cycling safety at intersections between multiuse trails and roads  and more generally  when conflicts occur between diverse transportation modes  
 name that tune  mitigation of driver fatigue via a song naming game fatigued driving contributes to a substantial number of motor vehicle accidents each year  music listening is often employed as a countermeasure during driving in order to mitigate the effects of fatigue  though music listening has been established as a distractor in the sense that it increases cognitive load during driving  it is possible that increased cognitive load is desirable under particular circumstances  for instance  during situations that typically result in cognitive underload  such as driving in a low traffic monotonous stretch of highway  it may be beneficial for cognitive load to increase  thereby necessitating allocation of greater cognitive resources to the task of driving and attenuating fatigue  in the current study  we employed a song naming game as a countermeasure to fatigued driving in a simulated monotonous environment  during the first driving session  we established that driving performance deteriorates in the absence of an intervention following 30 min of simulated driving  during the second session  we found that a song naming game employed at the point of fatigue onset was an effective countermeasure  as reflected by simulated driving performance that met or exceeded fresh driving behavior and was significantly better relative to fatigued performance during the first driving session  
 narrow lanes and their effect on drivers  behaviour at motorway roadworks in recent years  more use of narrow lanes as a temporary traffic management scheme  itms  on uk motorway roadwork sections has been made  the rationale is to free up carriageway space  especially for sites with high traffic demands needing repairs  what remains to be determined is the impact of this work on traffic operation  this is important due to the need to manage traffic operational turbulence which could affect the capacity as well as safety levels in roadwork sections  site observations  mainly using camcorders from overhead bridges  were made which uncovered two discernible patterns of driving behaviour where narrow lanes are implemented at roadworks  especially when heavy goods vehicles  hgvs  are present   i   avoiding  passing overtaking hgvs travelling in the adjacent lanes and  ii  lane  repositioning  while passing overtaking which might cause some turbulence to traffic operation  from one site  almost half of the passenger car drivers  including small vans  who were following a hgv on the adjacent lanes were avoiding passing that hgv  also  nearly three quarters of the observed passenger cars  the passenger car drivers tried to position their vehicles as far away as possible  laterally  from the adjacent hgv while passing overtaking that hgv in order to widen the lateral gap between their vehicles and the hgv  this resulted in driving too close to the edge of the road markings of their current lane away from the hgv  therefore  this paper aims to report on the  avoiding  and lane  repositioning  behaviours to help inform traffic management teams designers using narrow lanes as itms and make them aware of such behaviours  especially for motorway sections carrying high percentages of hgvs   also  the finding from these observations were used in the development of a new micro simulation model in order to evaluate the effect of such turbulence   c  2017 elsevier ltd  all rights reserved  
 naturalistic assessment of the learner license period the purpose of this study was to describe the characteristics and progression of practice driving during the learner license period in a sample of teenagers  during the first and last 10 h of practice driving  we examined  1  the amount  variety and complexity of conditions of practice   2  the nature of parental instruction  and  3  errors that teens made while driving  data were collected from 90 teens and 131 parents living in virginia  usa  using in vehicle cameras  audio recorders  gps and trip recorders  based on data collected from the instrumented vehicles  teens practiced for 46 6 h on average  slightly higher than the gdl requirement for their jurisdiction  though half did not complete the required 45 h of practice and only 17  completed the required 15 h of night time driving  exposure to diverse roadways increased over the practice driving period  which averaged 10 6 months  most driving instruction occurred in reaction to specific driving situations  such as navigating and identifying hazards  and could be characterized as co driving  higher order instruction  which relates to the tactics or strategies for safe driving  was less frequent  but remained stable through the practice driving period  instruction of all forms was more likely following an elevated gravitational force  g force  event  errors decreased over time  suggesting improvements in manual and judgment skills  but engagement in potentially distracting secondary tasks increased  when an adult was in the vehicle   a small percentage of trips occurred with no passenger in the front seat  and the g force rate during these trips was almost 5 times higher than trips with an adult front seat passenger  taken collectively  these findings indicate  1  most teens got at least the required amount of supervised practice  but some did not   2  instruction was mainly reactive and included some higher order instruction   3  teens driving skills improved despite increased exposure to complex driving conditions  but secondary tasks also increased  opportunities remained for improving the quality and variability in supervision and enhancing the development of skills during the lengthy period of practice  
 needed reduction in mobility energy consumption to meet the goal of a 2000 watt society greenhouse gas emissions related to energy production is the main cause of climate change  transportation accounts for 30  of the total energy consumption  and a reduction in the energy used for mobility is necessary  the 2000 watt society is an environmental concept that fixes a sustainable limit to the energy consumption in different sectors  including mobility  this paper evaluates the energy consumption in several mobility scenarios  and it assesses whether the goal suggested by the 2000 watt society is achievable  we investigate the social characteristics and travel habits of the population living in a case study area  then  we calculate the modal shift induced by transportation policies such as car sharing  car pooling and car free district  we evaluate the resulting energy consumption  and we compare it with the 2000 watt society limit  we conclude that only a set of measures combining car usage reduction  increase in walking and cycling  and reduction in the total travel distance can achieve the needed energy reduction   c  2017 elsevier ltd  all rights reserved  
 negative attitudes towards cyclists influence the acceptance of an in vehicle cyclist detection system the shift towards automation and safer vehicles will increasingly involve use of technological advancements such as advanced driver assistance systems  adas   nevertheless  these technologies need to meet users  perceived needs to be effectively implemented and purchased  based on an updated version of the technology acceptance model  tam   this study analyses the main determinants of drivers  intention to use an adas aimed at detecting cyclist and preventing potential collision with them through an auto braking system  even if the relevance of perceived usefulness  perceived ease of use and trust on the acceptance of a new system has been already discussed in literature  we considered the role of an external variable such as attitudes towards cyclists in the prediction of an adas aimed to improve the safety of cyclists  we administered a questionnaire measuring negative attitudes towards cyclists  trust  perceived usefulness  perceived ease of use and the behavioural intention to use the system to 480 italian drivers  path analysis using bayesian estimation showed that perceived usefulness  trust in the system  and negative attitudes towards cyclists have a direct effect on the intention to use the adas  considering the role of attitudes towards other road users in the intention to use new adas aimed to improve their safety could foster the user s acceptance  especially for those people who express a negative representation of cyclists and are even more unlikely to accept the technology   c  2017 the authors  published by elsevier ltd  
 neighborhood walking densities  a multivariate analysis in halifax  canada neighborhood walkability is important to planners and policy makers in the public health  land use planning  and transportation fields  this research contributes to knowledge of walking behaviour by aggregating gps tracked walking trips as neighborhood walking densities  and investigating local characteristics affecting those densities  the study maps walking trips in urban and suburban neighborhoods of halifax  canada  using data from the space time activity research  star  survey conducted in 2007 2008  respondents completed a two day time diary  and their movements were tracked using a gps data logger  the 1971 primary respondents recorded 5005 geo referenced walking trips  from mapped walking tracks  walking distances were aggregated to 87 census tracts  and expressed as walking densities  per resident  per meter of road  and per developed area   multivariate regression was used to examine which neighborhood variables and socio demographic controls are most useful as estimators of walking densities  contrary to much of the walkability literature  built environment measures of road connectivity and dwelling density were found to have little estimating power  rather  retail lot coverage ratio was the single most useful estimator  acting as a proxy to identify traditional retail shopping streets  office and institutional land uses were also important contributory estimators  highlighting areas of dense employment   as were measures of residents  income and age  
 network assignment model of integrating maritime and hinterland container shipping  application to central america the authors develop a model to predict worldwide container movements including both maritime and land shipping network from the viewpoint of cargo owners  given the liner shipping network provided by shipping companies and the level of service in each port  the network assignment methodology is applied to both an intermodal shipping network and maritime shipping sub network  by which the solution can be obtained in a huge  real scale network including more than 150 worlds  container ports as well as some hinterland network of the world  the developed model is applied to the central american region  where the international maritime containers are often transported across national borders by land  it is confirmed that the model output agrees with the actual container movement in terms of the container cargo throughput for each port  land container flow  and maritime flow by shipping company in central america  also  the model sensitivity to key parameters included in the model is confirmed reasonable  finally  it is also confirmed that the model can predict the volume of containers handled in the port of la union  where no liner service had previously called and a new liner service calls  
 network concentration indices for less than truckload transportation an efficient and service oriented transportation network is a necessary resource for successful less than truckload operations  the design and evaluation of transportation networks are mainly driven by quantitative particularly cost oriented measures  such as transport and transshipment costs  this type of measurement  however  simply cannot represent the manifold performance of a transportation network  in particular  incorporating network concentration into network design decisions overcomes the shortcomings of purely cost oriented decisions because spatial network concentration is at the root of many aspects of network performance  e g   congestion and network vulnerability   this paper suggests modifications to the network concentration index and the hubbing concentration index from the passenger airline context for less than truckload road transportation  the modified indices enable information to be conveyed by network concentration into less than truckload network design decisions and provide a suitable perspective to include service oriented aspects into network design  
 network design of a transport system based on accelerating moving walkways pollution  congestion and urbanistic considerations are leading to a change in the use of private vehicles in dense city centers  more frequently  the last mile is covered with systems such as public transport  car sharing and bike sharing as well as an increase in walking and cycling  following this trend  we assume a hypothetical scenario where the use of private cars is strongly limited in dense urban areas  and innovative transport modes must be used  this work investigates a futuristic system based on a network of accelerating moving walkways  amw  to facilitate the movement of pedestrians in city centers where cars have been banned  unlike constant speed moving walkways  amws can reach speeds of up to 15 km h thanks to an acceleration section  this paper presents a rigorous description of the system characteristics from a transportation point of view  develops a heuristic algorithm for the network design problem  and tests it on a real case study  given a network of urban roads and an origin destination demand  the optimization algorithm  which combines traffic assignment and supply modification  explores the trade off curve between the total travel time and capital cost of the infrastructure  the results give practical insight on the possible dimensioning of the system  show the optimal network designs  and how these vary with a reduction of the available budget  this paper investigates for the first time the use of amws at a network scale  and provides results useful for analyzing the system feasibility  the results on travel time  investment budget and payback period indicates that amws could be an effective mode of transport in cities   c  2017 published by elsevier ltd  
 network expansion to mitigate market power constrained transmission capacity in electricity networks may give generators the possibility to game the market by specifically causing congestion and thereby appropriating excessive rents  investment in network capacity can ameliorate such behavior by reducing the potential for strategic behavior  however  modeling nash equilibria between generators  which explicitly account for their impact on the network  is mathematically and computationally challenging  we propose a three stage model to describe how network investment can reduce market power exertion  a benevolent planner decides on network upgrades for existing lines anticipating the gaming opportunities by strategic generators  these firms  in turn  anticipate their impact on market clearing prices and grid congestion  in this respect  we provide the first model endogenizing the trade off between the costs of grid investment and benefits from reduced market power potential in short run market clearing  in a numerical example using a three node network  we illustrate three distinct effects  firstly  by reducing market power exertion  network expansion can yield welfare gains beyond pure efficiency increases  anticipating gaming possibilities when planning network expansion can push welfare close to a first best competitive benchmark  secondly  network upgrades entail a relative shift of rents from producers to consumers when congestion rents were excessive  thirdly  investment may yield suboptimal or even disequilibrium outcomes when strategic behavior of certain market participants is neglected in network planning  
 network pricing of congestion free networks  the elastic and linear demand case in this work  we address the problem of maximizing the revenue raised from tolls set on a multicommodity transportation network  taking into account that users are assigned to cheapest paths  and that demand is a linearly decreasing function of total path cost  initial cost of carrying the products plus toll   we propose for its numerical solution three mixed quadratic formulations  either in arc or path flow space  similar to what was achieved in the fixed demand case  we analyze the structure and properties of the problem  including its theoretical complexity  on the computational side  we analyze the sensitivity of central processing unit time with respect to two key parameters  namely  demand elasticity and percentage of toll arcs  
 network signal setting design with stage sequence optimisation one of the most straightforward short term policies to mitigate urban traffic congestion is control through traffic lights at a single junction or network level  existing approaches for single junction signal setting design  ssd  can be grouped into two classes  stage based or phase based methods  both these approaches take the lane marking layouts as exogenous inputs  but lane based optimisation method may be found in literature  even though for isolated signal controlled junctions only  the network signal setting design  nssd  requires that offsets are introduced  a traffic flow model is also needed to compute total delay  all existing methods for nssd follow a stage based approach  these methods do not allow for stage matrix optimisation  it is shown that explicit enumeration of stage sequences is only practicable for very small networks  this paper focuses on network signal setting design introducing the so called scheduled synchronisation that includes green scheduling  green timing and coordination into one optimisation problem  the paper proposes a stage based method to solve such a problem  as an extension of the synchronisation method and the traffic flow model proposed in cantarella et al   2015   first a set of candidate stages is defined for each junction  then the stage sequences  the stage lengths and the offsets are optimised all together  to the authors  knowledge  no other one step optimisation method is available in literature for scheduled synchronisation  results of the proposed method to a small network were compared with those from explicit enumeration of all stage sequences  results for a larger network are also discussed   c  2017 elsevier ltd  all rights reserved  
 network user equilibrium problems for the mixed battery electric vehicles and gasoline vehicles subject to battery swapping stations and road grade constraints there has been growing attention on battery electric vehicles  bevs  due to their energy efficiency and environmental friendliness  this paper deals with the user equilibrium  ue  problems for the mixed bevs and traditional gasoline vehicles  gvs  in transportation networks with battery swapping stations and road grade constraints  under the assumption that electricity consumption rate is not affected by traveling speed or traffic flow  a nonlinear minimization model in terms of path flows is first formulated by incorporating effects of road grade on the electricity consumption rate  the battery swapping action based paths are defined for bevs in the represented network to facilitate the model building with flow dependent dwell time at the battery swapping stations  the frank wolfe  f w  algorithm  where descent direction is found by the multi label method in a pseudo polynomial time  is adopted to solve the model  moreover  the aforementioned assumption about the flow independent electricity consumption rate is then relaxed and a system of inequalities has been proposed to formulate the ue conditions  for the nonlinear minimization model  two numerical examples are presented to assess the propose model and algorithm  as well as to analyze the impact of usable battery capacity  bevs  market share and some attributes of battery swapping stations on the equilibrium link flows and or swapping flows  the system of inequalities is exactly solved for a small network by path enumeration to demonstrate the non uniqueness of ue link flow solutions   c  2017 elsevier ltd  all rights reserved  
 network wide adaptive tolling for connected and automated vehicles this article proposes a tolling  a simple adaptive pricing scheme which only requires travel time observations and two tuning parameters  these tolls are applied throughout a road network  and can be updated as frequently as travel time observations are made  notably  a tolling does not require any details of the traffic flow or travel demand models other than travel time observations  rendering it easy to apply in real time  the flexibility of this tolling scheme is demonstrated in three specific traffic modeling contexts with varying traffic flow and user behavior assumptions  a day to day pricing model using static network equilibrium with link delay functions  a within day adaptive pricing model using the cell transmission model and dynamic routing of vehicles  and a microsimulation of reservation based intersection control for connected and autonomous vehicles with myopic routing  in all cases  a tolling produces significant benefits over the no toll case  measured in terms of average travel time and social welfare  while only requiring two parameters to be tuned  some optimality results are also given for the special case of the static network equilibrium model with bpr style delay functions   c  2017 elsevier ltd  all rights reserved  
 networked traffic state estimation involving mixed fixed mobile sensor data using hamilton jacobi equations nowadays  traffic management has become a challenge for urban areas  which are covering larger geographic spaces and facing the generation of different kinds of traffic data  this article presents a robust traffic estimation framework for highways modeled by a system of lighthill whitham richards equations that is able to assimilate different sensor data available  we first present an equivalent formulation of the problem using a hamilton jacobi equation  then  using a semi analytic formula  we show that the model constraints resulting from the hamilton jacobi equation are linear ones  we then pose the problem of estimating the traffic density given incomplete and inaccurate traffic data as a mixed integer program  we then extend the density estimation framework to highway networks with any available data constraint and modeling junctions  finally  we present a travel estimation application for a small network using real traffic measurements obtained obtained during mobile century traffic experiment  and comparing the results with ground truth data   c  2017 elsevier ltd  all rights reserved  
 new functional pavements for pedestrians and cyclists when many fields of pedestrian and cyclist safety have been extensively studied  the surfacing has long been left unquestioned  despite being developed for another mode of transport and being one of the main causes for falls and fall injuries  in this project new surfacing materials for pedestrian and cyclist safety have been produced  focusing on augmenting previously largely disregarded parameters as impact absorption  comfort and visibility at the same time as avoiding deteriorating of crucial parameters as friction and wear resistance  rubber content  binder type  and pigment addition have been varied and evaluated  the results demonstrate that by increasing rubber content of the mixtures the head injury criterion  hic  value and injury risk can be decreased while maintaining frictional properties according to existing criteria  assembly of test lanes demonstrate that some developed materials experience lower flow and component separation than standard materials due to rubber addition  calling for further optimisation of construction procedure linked to content development  initial trials on the test lanes indicate that a polyurethane  pu  based material has high cycling comfort  visibility and can be modified with phosphorescence properties  for standard asphalt  impact absorption might be inflicted by modification of bitumen alone but is mostly augmented by rubber addition  the results also indicate that rubber content can decrease ice formation on the materials   c  2016 elsevier ltd  all rights reserved

 non discriminatory train dispatching in a rail transport market with multiple competing and collaborative train operating companies train dispatching is vital for the punctuality of train services  which is critical for a train operating company  toc  to maintain its competitiveness  due to the introduction of competition in the railway transport market  the issue of discrimination is attracting more and more attention  this paper focuses on delivering non discriminatory train dispatching solutions while multiple tocs are competing in a rail transport market  and investigating impacting factors of the inequity of train dispatching solutions  a mixed integer linear programming  milp  model is first proposed  in which the inequity of competitors  i e   trains and tocs  is formalized by a set of constraints  in order to provide a more flexible framework  a model is further reformulated where the inequity of competitors is formalized as the maximum individual deviation of competitors  delay cost from average delay cost in the objective function  complex infrastructure capacity constraints are considered and modelled through a big m based approach  the proposed models are solved by a standard milp solver  a set of comprehensive experiments is conducted on a real world dataset adapted from the dutch railway network to test the efficiency  effectiveness  and applicability of the proposed models  as well as determine the trade off between train delays and delay equity   c  2017 elsevier ltd  all rights reserved  
 non expected route choice model under risk on stochastic traffic networks in this paper  we propose a novel non expected route travel time  nertt  model  which belong to the rank dependent expected utility model  the nertt consists of two parts  which are the route travel time distribution and the distortion function  with the strictly increasing and strictly concave distortion function  we can prove that the route travel time in the proposed model is risk averse  which is the main focus of this paper  we show two different reduction methods from the nertt model to the travel time budget model and mean excess travel time model  one method is based on the properly selected distortion functions and the other one is based on a general distortion function  besides  the behavioral inconsistency of the expected utility model in the route choice can be overcome with the proposed model  the nertt model can also be generalized to the non expected disutility  ned  model  and some relationship between the ned model and the route choice model based on the cumulative prospect theory can be shown  this indicates that the proposed model has some generality  finally  we develop a non expected risk averse user equilibrium model and formulate it as a variational inequality  vi  problem  a heuristic gradient projection algorithm with column generation is used to solve the vi  the proposed model and algorithm are tested on some hypothetical traffic networks and on some large scale traffic networks  
 non myopic relocation of idle mobility on demand vehicles as a dynamic location allocation queueing problem operation of on demand services like taxis  dynamic ridesharing services  or vehicle sharing depends significantly on the positioning of idle vehicles to anticipate future demand and operational states  a new queueing based formulation is proposed for the problem of relocating idle vehicles in an on demand mobility service  the approach serves as a decision support tool for future studies in urban transport informatics and design of new types of urban mobility systems like carsharing  ridesharing  and smart taxis  a lagrangian decomposition heuristic is developed and compared with a relaxed lower bound solution  using new york taxicab data  the proposed algorithm reduces the cost by up to 27  compared to the myopic case   c  2017 elsevier ltd  all rights reserved  
 nonverbal communication during the learner lesson with a professional driving instructor  a novel investigation background  fundamental for the development of the driving and road use skills of the young driver is learning to drive through driving instruction and  in graduated driver licensing programs such as in australia  driving supervision  in queensland young drivers are required to log a minimum of 100 h supervised practice  with recent research revealing that parents provide most of this supervision  queensland also offers young drivers a 10 h 3 for 1 bonus for professional driving instruction  such that one hour of professional instruction can be logged as three hours of practice  to a maximum of 30 logbook hours  recent research efforts have begun to provide insight into the nature of the verbal instruction of both parents and professional instructors  and into the nonverbal communication between parents and learners  however nothing is known regarding the nonverbal communication between professional instructors and learners  method  ten learner lessons  five male learners  with four professional instructors  four males  were captured via gopro cameras  the nonverbal communication during the first  middle  and last 10 min of each lesson was coded as being posture and body orientation  gestures  facial expressions  proximity  humour  and eye contact  within the context of the accompanying verbal communication according to the value of  a  eager  or  b  cautious  the valence of  a  neutral   b  positive  or  c  negative  and the purpose of  a  rapport  or  b  communication  results  overall  posture and body orientation was the most common mechanism of nonverbal communication  while facial expressions and proximity were the least common mechanisms of nonverbal communication  in general the beginning  the middle  and the end of the lessons were characterised by a plethora of neutral  cautious interactions  and positive  eager interactions  however it is noteworthy that the rates at which learners and instructors engaged in these behaviours were found to change across the lesson  specifically learners actively communication nonverbally through mechanisms such as eye contact  facial expressions and humour  while instructors appeared to manage building rapport and communicating safe vehicle and road use through nonverbal communication such as gestures  facial expressions and posture and body orientation  summarised in a model comprising a continuum of instruction  discussion  while nonverbal communication is fundamental for effective verbal communication  and on occasion can replace verbal communication  and as such the professional and the parental driving lesson should optimise the use of nonverbal communication  at this time the optimal nature of nonverbal communication remains unknown  in addition  optimal verbal and nonverbal communication specifically suited to the driving context which involves a dynamic environment outside the vehicle  and at times a dynamic environment inside the vehicle  remains yet to be identified  the research findings provide unique insight into the nature of the nonverbal communication used by both learner drivers and professional driving instructors  in addition to the continuum of instruction model  as such  the findings provide a solid foundation for future research into  and guidance regarding  optimising the learner driving lesson   c  2017 elsevier ltd  all rights reserved  
 novelty helmet use and motorcycle rider fatality objectives  to compare the risk of fatal injury across helmet types among collision involved motorcyclists  methods  we used data from a cohort of motorcyclists involved in police reported traffic collisions  eighty four law enforcement agencies in california collected detailed information on helmet and rider characteristics during collision investigations in june 2012 through july 2013  multiply adjusted risk ratios were estimated with log binomial regression  results  the adjusted fatal injury risk ratio for novelty helmets was 1 95  95  ci 1 11 3 40  p 0 019   comparing novelty helmets with full face helmets  the risk ratios for modular  open face  and half helmets  compared with full face helmets  were not significant  conclusions  a more complete understanding of the inadequacy of novelty helmets can be used in educational and law enforcement countermeasures to improve helmet use among motorcycling populations in california and other us states  law enforcement approaches to mitigating novelty helmet use would seem attractive given that novelty helmets can be visually identified by law enforcement officers with sufficient training  
 occupant responses in conventional and abts seats in high speed rear sled tests objective  this study compared biomechanical responses of a normally seated hybrid iii dummy on conventional and all belts to seat  abts  seats in 40 2 km h  25 mph  rear sled tests  it determined the difference in performance with modern  2000 my  seats compared to older   2000 my  seats and abts seats methods  the seats were fixed in a sled buck subjected to a 40 2 km h  25 mph  rear sled test  the pulse was a 15 g double peak acceleration with 150ms duration  the 50th percentile hybrid iii was lap shoulder belted in the fmvss 208 design position  the testing included 11  2000 my  8 2000 my  and 7 abts seats  the dummy was fully instrumented  including head accelerations  upper and lower neck 6 axis load cells  chest acceleration  thoracic and lumbar spine load cells  and pelvis accelerations  the peak responses were normalized by injury assessment reference values  iarvs  to assess injury risks  statistical analysis was conducted using student s t test  high speed video documented occupant kinematics results  biomechanical responses were lower with modern  2000 my  seats than older   2000 my  designs  the lower neck extension moment was 32 5 9 7  of iarv in modern seats compared to 62 8     31 6  in older seats  p   01   overall  there was a 34  reduction in the comparable biomechanical responses with modern seats  biomechanical responses were lower with modern seats than abts seats  the lower neck extension moment was 41 4     7 8  with all my abts seats compared to 32 5     9 7  in modern seats  p   07   overall  the abts seats had 13  higher biomechanical responses than the modern seats conclusions  modern  2000 my  design seats have lower biomechanical responses in 40 2 km h rear sled tests than older   2000 my  designs and abts designs  the improved performance is consistent with an increase in seat strength combined with improved occupant kinematics through pocketing of the occupant into the seatback  higher and more forward head restraint  and other design changes  the methods and data presented here provide a basis for standardized testing of seats  however  a complete understanding of seat safety requires consideration of out of position  oop  occupants in high speed impacts and consideration of the much more common  low speed rear impacts  
 occupant thorax response variations due to arm position and restraint systems in side impact crash scenarios recent epidemiological studies have identified that thoracic side airbags may vary in efficacy to reduce injury severity in side impact crash scenarios  while previous experimental and epidemiological studies have presented contrasting results  this study aimed to quantify the variations in occupant response in side impact conditions using a human body computational model integrated with a full vehicle model  the model was analyzed for a moving deformable barrier side impact at 61 km h to assess two pre crash arm positions  the incorporation of a seatbelt  and a thorax air bag on thorax response  the occupant response was evaluated using chest compression  the viscous criterion and thoracic spinal curvature  the arm position accounted for largest changes in the thorax response  106   compared to the presence of the airbag and seatbelt systems  75    it was also noted that the results were dependant on the method and location of thorax response measurement and this should be investigated further  assessment using lateral displacement of the thoracic spine correlated positively with chest compression and viscous criterion  with the benefit of evaluating whole thorax response and provides a useful metric to compare occupant response for different side impact safety systems  the thoracic side airbag was found to increase the chest compression for the driving arm position    70    and reduced the injury metrics for the vertical arm position    17    this study demonstrated the importance of occupant arm position on variability in thoracic response  and provides insight for future design and optimization of side impact safety systems  
 occupant level injury severity analyses for taxis in hong kong  a bayesian space time logistic model this study aimed to identify the factors affecting the crash related severity level of injuries in taxis and quantify the associations between these factors and taxi occupant injury severity  casualties resulting from taxi crashes from 2004 to 2013 in hong kong were divided into four categories  taxi drivers  taxi passengers  private car drivers and private car passengers  to avoid any biased interpretation caused by unobserved spatial and temporal effects  a bayesian hierarchical logistic modeling approach with conditional autoregressive priors was applied  and four different model forms were tested  for taxi drivers and passengers  the model with space time interaction was proven to most properly address the unobserved heterogeneity effects  the results indicated that time of week  number of vehicles involved  weather  point of impact and driver age were closely associated with taxi drivers  injury severity level in a crash  for taxi passengers  injury severity an additional factor  taxi service area  was influential  to investigate the differences between taxis and other traffic  similar models were established for private car drivers and passengers  the results revealed that although location in the network and driver gender significantly influenced private car drivers  injury severity  they did not influence taxi drivers  injury severity  compared with taxi passengers  the injury severity of private car passengers was more sensitive to average speed and whether seat belts were worn  older drivers  urban taxis and fatigued driving were identified as factors that increased taxi occupant injury severity in hong kong

 off the rails  the cost performance of infrastructure rail projects governments in australia place great emphasis on the development and expansion of their rail networks to improve productivity and service the increasing needs and demands from businesses and commuters  a case study approach is used to analyze the cost performance of 16 rail projects constructed by a contractor between 2011 and 2014  which ranged from au 3 4 to au 353 million  findings indicate that scope changes during construction were the key contributors that lead to the amendment of each project s original contractual value  as a result  there is a need for public and private sector asset owners to establish a cost contingency using a probabilistic rather than a deterministic approach to accommodate the potential for scope changes during construction  to improve cost certainty during the construction of rail projects  it is suggested that use of collaborative forms of procurement juxtaposed with the use of building information modelling and systems information modelling are implemented  the utilization of such technological and process innovations can provide public and private sector asset owners charged with delivering and maintaining their rail networks with confidence projects can be delivered within budget and are resilient to unexpected events and adaptable to changing needs  uses or capacities   c  2017 elsevier ltd  all rights reserved  
 offset optimization in signalized traffic networks via semidefinite relaxation we study the problem of selecting offsets of the traffic signals in a network of signalized intersections to reduce queues of vehicles at all intersections  the signals in the network have a common cycle time and a fixed timing plan  it is assumed that the exogenous demands are constant or periodic with the same period as the cycle time and the intersections are under saturated  the resulting queuing processes are periodic  these periodic processes are approximated by sinusoids  the sinusoidal approximation leads to an analytical expression of the queue lengths at every intersection as a function of the demands and the vector of offsets  the optimum offset vector is the solution of a quadratically constrained quadratic program  qcqp   which is solved via its convex semidefinite relaxation  unlike existing techniques  our approach accommodates networks with arbitrary topology and scales well with network size  we illustrate the result in two case studies  the first is an academic example previously proposed in the literature  and the second case study consists of an arterial corridor network in arcadia  california   c  2017 elsevier ltd  all rights reserved  
 on developing a driver identification methodology using in vehicle data recorders recently  cutting edge technologies to facilitate data collection have emerged on a large scale  one of the most prominent is the in vehicle data recorder  ivdr   there are multiple ways to assign the ivdr s data to the different drivers who share the same vehicle  irrespective of the level of sophistication  all of these technologies still suffer considerable limitations in their accuracy  the purpose of this paper is to propose a methodology  which can identify the driver of a given trip using historical tripbased data  to do so  an advanced machine learning pipeline is proposed  the main goal is to take advantage of highly available data such as driver labeled floating car data collected by a ivdr to build a pattern based algorithm able to identify the trip s driver category when its true identity is unknown  this stepwise process includes feature generation selection  multiple heterogeneous explanatory models  and an ensemble approach  i e   stacked generalization  to reduce their generalization error  our goal is to provide an inexpensive alternative to existing driver identification technologies  which can serve as their complement and or validation purposes  experiments conducted over a real world case study from israel uncover the potential of this idea  it obtained an accuracy of similar to 88  and cohen s kappa agreement score of similar to 74   
 on load balancing strategies for baggage screening at airports we study load balancing policies for an airport baggage handling system  bhs   the performance of the screening subsystem is important as it can potentially cause traffic congestion of the whole bhs during peak period  currently  the round robin  rr  and the first available  fa  polices are implemented at airports  this paper presents a simulative approach to evaluate the impact of load balancing policies on the system performance  using discrete event simulations  airport practitioners can assess the effectiveness of the policies according to the actual layout of a particular passenger terminal  in addition to the rr and fa  a join shortest queue  jsq  policy is introduced  this scheme can be applied jointly with the rr for daily operations  a case study is presented to illustrate the characteristics of this scheme  simulation results demonstrate that the rr jsq can replace the existing rr fa for a better balanced load distribution and improve the overall system performance   c  2017 elsevier ltd  all rights reserved  
 on node criticality in air transportation networks in this study  we analyze the criticality of nodes in air transportation using techniques from three different domains  and thus  three essentially different perspectives of criticality  first  we examine the unweighted structure of air transportation networks  using recent methods from control theory  maximum matching and minimum dominating set   second  complex network metrics  betweenness and closeness  are used with passenger traffic as weights  third  ticket data level analysis  origin destination betweenness and outbound traffic with transit threshold  is performed  remarkably  all techniques identify a different set of critical nodes  while  in general  giving preference to the selection of high degree nodes  our evaluation on the international air transportation country network suggests that some countries  e g   united states  france  and germany  are critical from all three perspectives  other countries  e g   united arab emirates and panama  have a very specific influence  by controlling the passenger traffic of their neighborhood countries  furthermore  we assess the criticality of the country network using multi criteria decision analysis  mcda  techniques  united states  great britain  germany  and united arab emirates are identified as non dominated countries  sensitivity analysis shows that united arab emirates is most sensitive to the preference information on the outbound traffic  our work gears towards a better understanding of node criticality in air transportation networks  this study also stipulates future research possibilities on criticality in general transportation networks  
 on node models for high dimensional road networks macroscopic traffic models are necessary for simulation and study of traffic s complex macro scale dynamics  and are often used by practitioners for road network planning  integrated corridor management  and other applications  these models have two parts  a link model  which describes traffic flow behavior on individual roads  and a node model  which describes behavior at road junctions  as the road networks under study become larger and more complex nowadays often including arterial networks the node model becomes more important  despite their great importance to macroscopic models  however  only recently have node models had similar levels of attention as link models in the literature  this paper focuses on the first order node model and has two main contributions  first  we formalize the multi commodity flow distribution at a junction as an optimization problem with all the necessary constraints  most interesting here is the formalization of input flow priorities  then  we discuss a very common  conservation of turning fractions  or  first in first out   fifo  constraint  and how it often produces unrealistic spillback  this spillback occurs when  at a diverge  a queue develops for a movement that only a few lanes service  but fifo requires that all lanes experience spillback from this queue  as we show  avoiding this unrealistic spillback while retaining fifo in the node model requires complicated network topologies  our second contribution is a  partial fifo  mechanism that avoids this unrealistic spillback  and a  first order  node model and solution algorithm that incorporates this mechanism  the partial fifo mechanism is parameterized through intervals that describe how individual movements influence each other  can be intuitively described from physical lane geometry and turning movement rules  and allows tuning to describe a link as having anything between full fifo and no fifo  excepting the fifo constraint  the present node model also fits within the well established  general class of first order node models  for multi commodity flows  several illustrative examples are presented   c  2017 published by elsevier ltd  
 on the distribution of individual daily driving distances plug in electric vehicles  pev  can reduce greenhouse gas emissions  however  the utility of pevs  as well as reduction of emissions is highly dependent on daily vehicle kilometres travelled  vkt   further  the daily vkt by individual passenger cars vary strongly between days  a common method to analyse individual daily vkt is to fit distribution functions and to further analyse these fits  however  several distributions for individual daily vkt have been discussed in the literature without conclusive decision on the best distribution  here we analyse three two parameter distribution functions for the variation in daily vkt with four sets of travel data covering a total of 190 000 driving days and 9 5 million vkt  specifically  we look at overall performance of the distributions on the data using four goodness of fit measures  as well as the consequence of choosing one distribution over the others for two common pev applications  the days requiring adaptation for battery electric vehicles and the utility factor for plug in hybrid electric vehicles  we find the weibull distribution to fit most vehicles well but not all and at the same time yielding good predictions for pev related attributes  furthermore  the choice of distribution impacts pev usage factors  here  the weibull distribution yields reliable estimates for electric vehicle applications whereas the log normal distribution yields more conservative estimates for pev usage factors  our results help to guide the choice of distribution for a specific research question utilising driving data and provide a methodological advancement in the application of distribution functions to longitudinal driving data   c  2017 the authors  published by elsevier ltd  this is an open access article under the cc by nc nd license   http   creativecommons org licenses by nc nd 4 0   
 on the effect of networks of cycle tracks on the risk of cycling  the case of seville we analyze the evolution of the risk of cycling in seville before and after the implementation of a network of segregated cycle tracks in the city  specifically  we study the evolution of the risk for cyclists of being involved in a collision with a motor vehicle  using data reported by the traffic police along the period 2000 2013  i e  seven years before and after the network was built  a sudden drop of such risk was observed after the implementation of the network of bikeways  we study  through a multilinear regression analysis  the evolution of the risk by means of explanatory variables representing changes in the built environment  specifically the length of the bikeways and a stepwise jump variable taking the values 0 1 before after the network was implemented  we found that this last variable has a high value as explanatory variable  even higher than the length of the network  thus suggesting that networking the bikeways has a substantial effect on cycling safety by itself and beyond the mere increase in the length of the bikeways  we also analyze safety in numbers through a non linear regression analysis  our results fully agree qualitatively and quantitatively with the results previously reported by jacobsen  2003   thus providing an independent confirmation of jacobsen s results  finally  the mutual causal relationships between the increase in safety  the increase in the number of cyclists and the presence of the network of bikeways are discussed   c  2017 elsevier ltd  all rights reserved  
 on the equivalence between sue and fixed point states of day to day assignment processes with serially correlated route choice we propose a new theoretical framework of deterministic processes of traffic assignment able to include day to day correlation of the random terms  according to the prevailing interpretation of random utility models  random terms are regarded as individual specific  correlation is justified by persistence of habits and unobservables  the framework includes the deterministic sequence of systematic utilities based on a learning filter  the stochastic process of the random terms based on a stationary autoregressive structure with i i d  gumbel or multivariate normal one day marginals  and the resulting stochastic process of choice which generally is not markov  the fixed point states of the choice process are the classical logit and probit stochastic user equilibrium  sue   the linkage between flows at any day and transition flows is made explicit  and  by this  a new perspective on the interpretation of sue is opened  sue is the condition where  at macro level  the observed route flows do not change across days  while  at micro level  individuals change route  only if random terms are unchanged no individual changes route  transition flows at sue are symmetric  i e  the number of shifters from path i to path j equals the number of shifters from path j to path i  the insights are illustrated by numerical examples related to a two link and a five link network  
 on the existence and uniqueness of equilibrium in the bottleneck model with atomic users this paper investigates the existence and uniqueness of equilibrium in the vickrey bottleneck model when each user controls a positive fraction of total traffic  users simultaneously choose departure schedules for their vehicle fleets  each user internalizes the congestion cost that each of its vehicles imposes on other vehicles in its fleet  we establish three results  first  a pure strategynash equilibrium  psne  may not exist  second  if a psne does exist  identical users may incur appreciably different equilibrium costs  finally  a multiplicity of psne can exist in which no queuing occurs but departures begin earlier or later than in the system optimum  the order in which users depart can be suboptimal as well  nevertheless  by internalizing self imposed congestion costs individual users can realize much  and possibly all  of the potential cost savings from either centralized traffic control or time varying congestion tolls  
 on the factors affecting the choice of regional transit for commuting in greater toronto and hamilton area  application of an advanced rp sp choice model this paper presents a jointly estimated revealed preference stated preference  rp sp  choice model to explore mode choice behavior of commuters in a multimodal regional transportation system in the greater toronto and hamilton area  gtha   the paper focuses on the commuting trips that are long enough to be served by more than one transit services  local and regional transit services  in the gtha  hence denoted by cross regional commuting   this type of trips represents a unique travel market for which multimodal transportation services compete with each other  the study uses a dataset collected by a purposely designed sp pivoted on rp choices of cross regional commuters in the gtha  an advanced rp sp model structure is specified to enhance parameter estimation from the sp choices by explicitly capturing the correlations between the sp choices and corresponding elicited confidence ratings  the econometric model also accounts for serial correlations between sp choices of the same respondents as well as inertia effects between rp and sp choices  the estimated choice model is used to predict the effectiveness of different strategies on commuting mode choice behaviour of cross regional commuters  the results of the empirical investigation revealed many behavioural details such as the effect of eliminating co fare between local and regional transit services and providing wi fi on regional transit vehicles on increasing the share of regional transit modes  it is found that monetizing park and ride at transit stations will deter some individuals from using transit  however  this strategy can be considered as a way to manage the increasing parking demand at regional transit stations and to improve the access time of park and ride users  
 on the selection of stimulus for the auditory variant of the detection response task method for driving experiments objectives  the detection response task  drt  is a method for measuring attentional effects of secondary tasks on a driver s cognitive load by measuring response times and hit rates to different types of stimuli as indirect indicators of increased cognitive load  iso 17488  international organization for standardization 2016  only provides guidelines for the technical implementation and measurement methods for the visual and tactile versions  use of visual and tactile stimuli  of the drt method  this article presents a study with the goal of finding the most appropriate auditory stimulus for the implementation of an auditory version of the drt method methods  this article presents the results of an experiment in which responses to 7 different auditory drt stimulivarying in frequencywere compared while inducing users  cognitive load with a modified n back task  the experiment was conducted in a surrogate driving environment and in a within subject design  response times  hit rates  and secondary task performances were observed as indicators of increased cognitive load results  significantly shorter response times were found for the white noise signal compared to single frequency signals  however  the largest differences in response times  for trials without and with a cognitive task  were found for 4  and 8 khz single frequency signals  no significant differences were found for hit rates and secondary task performances between the different stimuli conclusions  consistent significant differences in response times for all tested stimuli prove that the auditory drt variant is also sensitive to changes in cognitive load  the mean increase in response times of more than 25  for 4  and 8 khz signals for trials with a cognitive task compared to trials without one indicates that one of these signals could be used as a potential auditory stimulus for the auditory drt variant  
 on the stochastic fundamental diagram for freeway traffic  model development  analytical properties  validation  and extensive applications in this research  we apply a new calibration approach to generate stochastic traffic flow fundamental diagrams  we first prove that the percentile based fundamental diagrams are obtainable based on the proposed model  we further prove the proposed model has continuity  differentiability and convexity properties so that it can be easily solved by gauss newton method  by selecting different percentile values from 0 to 1  the speed distributions at any given densities can be derived  the model has been validated based on the ga400 data and the calibrated speed distributions perfectly fit the speed density data  this proposed methodology has wide applications  first  new approaches can be proposed to evaluate the performance of calibrated fundamental diagrams by taking into account not only the residual but also ability to reflect the stochasticity of samples  secondly  stochastic fundamental diagrams can be used to develop and evaluate traffic control strategies  in particular  the proposed stochastic fundamental diagram is applicable to model and optimize the connected and automated vehicles at the macroscopic level with an objective to reduce the stochasticity of traffic flow  last but not the least  this proposed methodology can be applied to generate the stochastic models for most regression models with scattered samples   c  2017 elsevier ltd  all rights reserved  
 on the use of naturalistic methods to examine safety relevant behaviours amongst children and evaluate a cycling education program school based cycling education programs aim to improve cycling safety and participation amongst children  available research suggests that typical programs  which focus on bicycle manoeuvring skills  have limited effects on behaviour observed on a track or planned route  the current study uses theoretically more valid  naturalistic cycling data  to evaluate safe cycle  a program that incorporates hazard and self awareness training  soon after safe cycle was delivered at treatment schools  research bicycles instrumented with a rearward  and a forward facing camera were loaned to six children from treatment schools and six children from  waitlist  control schools  in each group half the children were in year 6  and half were in year 7 8  each child was instructed to ride the research bicycle instead of their own bicycle for the 1 2 weeks that they had a research bicycle  video data were reduced using a purpose designed coding scheme that identified whether participants performed specific safety relevant behaviours in appropriate circumstances  while the participants controlled their bicycles well  gave way appropriately to traffic at intersections  and stopped at red lights  participants frequently removed one or both hands from the handlebars  and seldom signalled turns  conducted over shoulder checks when changing lanes  or looked in multiple directions at intersections  except when crossing a road   while aspects of design and small sample sizes limited evaluation findings  this research demonstrated the feasibility and potential of naturalistic data to support cycling education program evaluation  further  the study substantially extended available naturalistic study of children s cycling behaviour to highlight behaviours which might be targeted by cycling safety initiatives  
 on the use of reservation based autonomous vehicles for demand management automated mobility on demand is foreseen as the future of urban passenger mobility  while mixed traffic for autonomous and conventional vehicles could be considered  separation amplifies the benefits of automation  combined with mobility as a service  separation also opens new possibilities in terms of demand management  we consider in this paper a single bottleneck dynamic framework  in which the capacity of a freeway is dedicated either to conventional or to autonomous vehicles  users of conventional vehicles freely choose their departure time from home and compete for the best departure times from the bottleneck  users of autonomous vehicles need to book their trip in advance  as the number of time slots available for booking does not exceed the capacity  booking users are guaranteed no delay at the bottleneck  an individual specific cooperation cost is introduced in the modeling framework  we then investigate how a central planner should allocate the capacity to these two vehicle types depending on the regime  laissez faire  welfare  or profit maximizing   two major findings are that the equilibrium demand split pareto dominates the case with only conventional cars and that the social cost difference between equilibrium and socially optimal demand splits is small compared to their benefits  although the pareto improvement result may not hold for every single user in the case of richer heterogeneity  it remains a key advantage of our booking scheme  profit maximizing strategies however turn out to be hardly compatible with welfare maximization   c  2017 published by elsevier ltd

 opening the door to social equity  local and participatory approaches to transportation planning in montreal purpose transportation systems play a key role in providing individuals with a diversity of means to access their desired destinations and have significant impacts on their quality of life  the social perspective of mobility is  however  marginalized in the current model of transportation planning and significant changes are called for  this study aims to identify the barriers and opportunities of local participatory approaches to trigger changes in transportation planning in montreal  drawing on the concept of social learning  methods a case study approach is selected and the participatory processes of two local transportation plans  ltps  are analysed  data is collected through document analysis and semi structured interviews with local transport planners and representatives of community groups  a qualitative content analysis is conducted to assess the outcomes of public participation  the quality of the processes and the perspectives of participants  results the results highlight the narrow contribution of the participation of local communities and community groups in the development of ltps  furthermore  the participatory process assessed in this research allows for a limited integration of social aspects in the planning process  the main barriers lie in the broader planning context and the organizational structure at the borough level as well as the lack of expertise of the community groups  nevertheless  ltps provide a window of opportunity for addressing transport related social aspects  conclusion in order to take advantage of this opportunity and foster social learning towards the desired changes  the process requires the inclusion of clear social equity goals at the metropolitan level  furthermore  the presence of a skilled facilitator is key to support the integration of diverse perspectives on transportation planning  it is also essential to provide community groups with resources to meaningfully participate in the process  thereby promoting social equity  in sum  ltps have the potential to further include the social dimension of transport  but further steps are required to foster an equitable and sustainable transportation system  this research is of relevance to researchers and planners wishing to better understand the challenges associated with participatory processes and social equity in transport planning

 optimal environmental road pricing and daily commuting patterns road pricing can improve air quality by reducing and spreading traffic flows  nevertheless  air quality does not depend only on traffic flows  but also on pollution dispersion  in this paper we investigate the effects of the temporal variation in pollution dispersion on optimal road pricing  and show that time varying road pricing is needed to make drivers internalize the social costs of both time varying congestion and time varying pollution  to this end  we develop an ecological economics model that takes into account the effects of road pricing on daily commuting patterns  we characterize the optimal road pricing when pollution dispersion varies over the day and analyze its effects on traffic flows  arrival times  and the number of commuters by car   c  2017 the authors  published by elsevier ltd  
 optimal hyperpaths with non additive link costs non additive fares are common in public transport as well as important for a range of other assignment problems  we discuss the problem of finding optimal hyperpaths under such conditions assuming a cost vector with a limited number of marginal decreasing costs depending on the number of links already traversed  we illustrate that these non additive costs lead to violation of bellman s optimality principle which in turn means that standard procedures to obtain optimal destination specific hyperpath trees are not feasible  to overcome the problem we introduce the concepts of a  travel history vector  and critical vs fixed nodes  the former records the expected number of traversed links until a node  and the latter distinguishes nodes for which the fare cost can be determined deterministically  with this we develop a 2 stage solution approach  in the first stage we test whether the optimal hyperpath can be obtained by backward search  if this is not the case  we propose a selective hyperpath generation to a  small  number of critical nodes and combine this with standard hyperpath search  we illustrate our approach by applying it to the sioux falls network showing that even for link cost functions  fare stages  with large step changes we are able to obtain all optimal hyperpaths in a reasonable computational time   c  2017 elsevier ltd  all rights reserved

 optimal recharging policies for electric vehicles recharging decisions for electric vehicles require many special considerations because of battery dynamics  battery longevity is prolonged by recharging less frequently and at slower rates  and also by not charging the battery too close to its maximum capacity  in this paper  we address the problem of finding an optimal recharging policy for an electric vehicle along a given path  the path consists of a sequence of nodes  each representing a charging station  and the driver must decide where to stop and how much to recharge at each stop  we present efficient algorithms for finding an optimal policy in general instances with deterministic travel costs and homogeneous charging stations  and also for two specialized cases one where the vehicle can stop anywhere along the path to recharge and another with equidistant charging stations along the path  in addition  we develop two heuristic procedures that we characterize analytically and explore empirically  we further analyze and test our solution methods on model variations that include stochastic travel costs and nonhomogeneous charging stations  
 optimal routing for plugle in hybrid electric vehicles we propose routing algorithms for plug in hybrid electric vehicles  phevs  that account for the significant energy efficiency differences of vehicle operating modes and recommend the predominant mode of operation for each road segment during route planning  this is to enhance fuel economy and reduce emissions  we introduce the energy efficient routing problem  eerp  for phevs and formulate this problem as a new class of the shortest path problem  the objective of the eerp is to not only find a path to any given destination but also to identify the predominant operating mode for each segment of the path to minimize fuel consumption  eerp can be generalized to a new class of problems in the context of network optimization  where for each arc we need to choose which resources to use to minimize the consumption of one of the resources subject to a constraint on the other resource  in this problem  the resource selection is mutually exclusive  which means we cannot choose both resources together for an arc  we prove that the eerp is np complete  we then propose two exact algorithms  and a fully polynomial time approximation scheme  fptas  to solve the eerp  we demonstrate the performance of our proposed exact and fptas algorithms using road network data from southeast michigan  the results show that incorporating our proposed algorithms during route planning leads to significant energy savings for phevs over simplistic routing algorithms and current practice  
 optimal time varying pricing for toll roads under multiple objectives  a simulation based optimization approach the determination of the pricing for tolled facilities always involves consideration of multiple objectives  e g   efficiency  safety  pollution  reliability  and economy  simulations are widely used to evaluate the performance of transportation systems as to the various objectives in response to different travel demand management policies  however  transportation simulation is usually associated with high computation costs and non closed form objective functions  this paper builds a simulation based optimization framework  and uses surrogate models to approximate the true simulation function  a significant amount of computation time can be saved with this method  to solve real world application problems  we develop infill strategies for multiobjective and constrained optimization problems  using dynust as the simulator  we optimize the toll rates for a five segment toll road in maryland  and successfully update the pareto front based on initial samples for the multiobjective optimization problem  the method works even more efficiently for the constrained optimization problem  by adjusting the toll rates for the five segments  the network wide average travel time can be reduced by 20  compared to the currently implemented toll scheme  a total of 22 250 hours can be saved in travel time for all network users in the three hour morning peak period  also  the toll revenue is increased by 50  compared to the baseline case  
 optimal toll of new highway in the equilibrium framework of heterogeneous households  residential location choice because of limited budget and the consideration of transportation demand management  most of the new highways will be tolled after putting them into use  meanwhile  lots of people belonging to different sectors of society flocked to city to search for jobs and better living each year  therefore  for the government departments  one of most important issues is to determine the optimal toll of new highway under the background of ever increasing households  this paper proposes an optimal toll model in the equilibrium framework of heterogeneous households  residential location choice  it is formulated as a bi level program  in the upper level subprogram  government departments determine an optimal toll of new highway in order to minimize urban system s total travel time  however  the construction and toll charge of the new highway will totally change urban traffic condition  and thus under the assumption of a complete market economy it will further affect the new households  location and commute behavior  here  new households  location choice behavior has been modeled based on reference dependent theory and household balance model  and their route choice behavior has been formulated as the multi class multi criteria stochastic user equilibrium model  this combined residential location choice and traffic assignment problem has been formulated by fixed point theory as the lower level program  finally  a genetic algorithm based solution approach is used to solve this optimization problem  in addition  a set of numerical experiments has been conducted to demonstrate the properties of this problem and the performance of our proposed model  and some interesting conclusions have been given

 overcoming barriers to cycling  understanding frequency of cycling in a university setting and the factors preventing commuters from cycling on a regular basis much local and regional transport policy is attempting to increase cycling as an everyday mode of travel through infrastructure changes  education initiatives  and safety campaigns  while considerable research has examined the influence of the built form on cycling  less research has examined the barriers that prevent people who wish to cycle more  as part of their routine  from doing so  this study examines several factors influencing the frequency by which people do  and do not  cycle in a campus setting in a large metropolitan area  mixed methods reveal differences between barriers to cycling as well as the relative strength of these barriers across categories of age  sex  and current mode used  a multinomial logit model  which controls for residential self selection effects  predicts whether and how often a respondent cycles based on socio demographic and trip characteristics  the presence of cycle paths is found to be strongly associated with a higher frequency of cycling commutes  additionally  an analysis of stated barriers reveals effort and a lack of safety as the most important barriers to potential cyclists  finally  a qualitative analysis of respondents  open ended responses confirms the influence of bicycle paths  but reveals other factors such as the importance of improved interactions among various street users  findings from this research can be of benefit to transportation engineers and planners who are aiming to increase the use of cycling among various groups of commuters  
 own and cross price elasticities of demand for domestic flights and intercity trains in the us in 2009  the u s  federal government announced its plan to invest in the expansion of the passenger rail system  instead of adding to the freeway or aviation systems  on the other hand  environmental studies show that passenger rails have a lower polluting impact than flights or cars  in order to evaluate whether consumers would switch from flights to trains and use the new rail system  this paper estimates the own and cross price elasticities of demand for domestic flights and passenger trains using the methodology described in berry  1994   specifically  the changes in demand for domestic flights and trains with respect to their prices are evaluated  the static model in this study suggests that the substitutability between these two modes of transport is minimal  in other words  travelers will to change their choices is very small given the configuration of the transportation system when the notice was made  in particular  train trips are substituted more easily   c  2017 elsevier ltd  all rights reserved  
 parental perceptions of cycle skills training for adolescents objective  traffic safety is a key concern regarding cycling for transportation  parental perceptions of adolescents  cycle skills may influence the uptake of cycling for transportation among adolescents  this study examined parental perceptions of cycle skills training  cst  for new zealand adolescents where rates of adolescents  cycling for transportation are low  methods  parents  n 310  age  47 7     5 3 years  77 7  females  of adolescents  age  15 1     1 6 years  51 0  females  from dunedin  new zealand  completed a survey about travel to school habits and parental perceptions of cycling to school  their adolescent s cycling skills  and cst  perceived benefits and provision of cst at school   data were analysed using linear mixed models  results  more than half of parents perceived that their adolescents had very good or excellent cycling skills  57 8    overall  73 2  of parents believed their adolescents would benefit from cst and of those parents 74 5  believed their adolescents would take cst at school  in a multivariate analysis  parental perceptions that cycling to school is important and unsafe  and having fewer vehicles at home were positively associated with parental perceptions that cst would make adolescents safer in traffic  all p    05   conclusions  nearly three quarters of parents perceived that their adolescents would benefit from participation in cst  parental perceptions that cycling to school is important and unsafe  and having fewer vehicles at home were associated with favourable parental perceptions of cst for adolescents  future interventions should also involve parents and consider offering cst in secondary schools as a part of the efforts to promote active transport to school  
 parking benefit districts   the transferability of a measure to reduce car dependency to a european context parking benefit districts  pbds  are a parking measure where revenues from on street parking charges are returned to the area where they are charged  and stakeholders in the area participate in prioritizing how the revenues are to be spent  the purpose of this article is to analyse whether and how a pbd programme can be transferred to a european context  and whether it can contribute to reduced car dependency  the first part of the article provides an overview of some salient features of pbd programmes in the usa through a literature survey  this is followed by results from interviews and from a focus group with civil servants and a deputy mayor in stockholm  the results are used to analyse the conditions for implementing a pbd programme in stockholm  as well as for analysing how such a programme can be designed to reduce car dependency  a main conclusion is that there are no legal barriers that render a pbd programme impossible in stockholm  even though there are some legal restrictions  we also conclude that a pbd programme might contribute to reduced car dependency in two different ways  either by increasing acceptance for parking charges or by improving the alternatives to private cars  there seem to be several aspects in a pbd programme that can contribute to increased acceptance for parking charges  however  there is no tradition of working with these principles in sweden and the programme s redistributional effects need to be taken into account when designing the programme  
 parking enforcement policies for commercial vehicles commercial vehicles are of particular interest in parking enforcement because of their heavy presence in central business districts and their recurrent behavior of illegal parking  to deter illegal commercial vehicle parking  enforcement policies are defined by the citation fine and level of enforcement  this paper investigates how rational carriers react to a policy under steady state equilibrium conditions  to model the equilibrium  the paper uses the theory of bilateral searching and meeting where enforcement units meet illegally parked commercial vehicles at a rate which depends on the size of the two agents  illegally parked commercial vehicles and enforcement units   in assessing policy effectiveness  two objectives are defined which are profit maximization and social cost minimization  with the two objectives  the paper presents three market regimes and studies the equilibrium of each market  the proposed model covers several gaps in the parking literature by introducing illegal parking behavior elasticity with respect to parking dwell time  level of enforcement  citation fine  and citation probability  the model is applied on a case study of the city of toronto and the results show that the citation probability increases with dwell time and the level of enforcement  increasing either the citation fine or level of enforcement will hinder illegal parking but the obtained profit remains approximately constant  sensitivity analysis on the meeting rate elasticity shows that profits are low when both elasticities are either high or low   c  2016 elsevier ltd  all rights reserved  
 passenger booking timing for low cost airlines  a continuous logit approach low cost airlines irregularly launch ticket promotions  where fares may differ by day of the week and departure dates  the timing for purchasing air tickets is thus closely associated with fares  airlines should analyze booking timing for tickets and increase the accuracy of demand forecasts to achieve efficient use of airplane seating and plan for promotional activities  therefore  this study develops a continuous choice model for timing decision making regarding bookings  a trigonometric function is used and interacts with trip and socioeconomic characteristics to capture the heterogeneous preferences of air passengers  data were collected from low cost airline passengers traveling from taiwan to singapore  the results of the continuous multinomial logit model indicate that lower fares increase the number of bookings and heterogeneous preferences in booking timing are present  some travelers tend to book flights earlier than the other groups  these are the price sensitive customers   c  2017 elsevier ltd  all rights reserved  
 passenger oriented railway disruption management by adapting timetables and rolling stock schedules in passenger railway operations  unforeseen events require railway operators to adjust their timetable and their resource schedules  the passengers will also adapt their routes to their destinations  when determining the new timetable and rolling stock schedule  the railway operator has to take passenger behavior into account  the operator should increase the capacity of trains for which the operator expects more demand than on a regular day  furthermore  the operator could increase the frequency of the trains that serve stations with an additional demand  this paper describes a real time disruption management approach which integrates the rescheduling of the rolling stock and the timetable by taking the changed passenger demand into account  the timetable decisions are limited to additional stops of trains at stations at which they normally would not call  several variants of the approach are suggested  with the difference in how to determine which additional stops should be executed  real time rescheduling requires fast solutions  therefore a heuristic approach is used  we demonstrate the performance of the several variants of our algorithm on realistic instances of netherlands railways  the major railway operator in the netherlands   c  2017 elsevier ltd  all rights reserved  
 paternalistic leadership and cabin crews  upward safety communication  the motivation of voice behavior being the frontline operators in the airline industry  flight attendants constantly obtain and collect first hand information from their interactions with passengers and other crew members  their experiences and observations may contribute greatly to airlines  safety management and policy making  it is thus critical to learn how to enhance cabin crews  voice behavior  particularly communicating safety related issues upward through specific leadership styles  the current research aims at the flight attendants working for taiwanese international airlines  the cabin crew department managers  paternalistic leadership style is adopted to observe how it may trigger cabin crews  different types of voice behavior  this research addresses the following two major questions  i  what is the motivation for cabin crew to conduct upward safety communication  2  how does department managers  paternalistic leadership style impact cabin crew s voice behavior  regression analysis is used to analyze the empirical data collected by the questionnaire survey  the results are applied to provide airlines with practical references for constituting human resource management policies  and the findings also enhance existing literature regarding management applications and employees voice behaviors   c  2017 elsevier ltd  all rights reserved  
 path to a multilayered transshipment port system  how the yangtze river bulk port system has evolved china s steel output has maintained rapid growth over the past twenty years  due to this  a large number of iron ore ports terminals have been built along the yangtze river  and the yangtze river bulk port system has experienced a unique development in its structure  this paper aims to understand the evolution of this bulk port system  1  along the yangtze river  to achieve this objective  first the development phases of the yangtze river bulk port system are reviewed  taking the theoretical  container  port evolution model as a benchmark  then several hypotheses addressing certain features of bulk port system development are proposed  followed by using panel data analysis to test these hypotheses  based on this discussion and analysis  the major driving forces that are reshaping bulk port development along the yangtze river are then summarized  it is found that evolution of the yangtze river bulk port system in general follows the port development models in previous literature  however  the trend toward regionalization and an offshore hub have not appeared  besides this  iron ore transshipment is moving outward both for sea ports and river ports  and few iron ore transshipment gateway hubs are occurring  furthermore  the transshipment function of a bulk port plays a significant role in port traffic changes  but this role is affecting sea ports differently to river ports  the container throughput of transshipment sea ports has a significant negative effect on bulk traffic  whereas that of transshipment river ports has a positive effect  geographical conditions  institutional factors and national policy  industry agglomeration  changes in market supply and demand  and technology updates are major factors driving changes to the port system structure  these factors are observed to function either individually or collectively at different development stages  
 path constrained traffic assignment  modeling and computing network impacts of stochastic range anxietye it is notoriously known that range anxiety is one of the major barriers that hinder a wide adoption of plug in electric vehicles  especially battery electric vehicles  recent studies suggested that if the caused driving range limit makes any impact on travel behaviors  it more likely occurs on the tour or trip chain level than the trip level  to properly assess its impacts on travel choices and traffic congestion  this research is devoted to studying a new network equilibrium problem that implies activity location and travel path choices on the trip chain level subject to stochastic driving ranges  convex optimization and variational inequality models are respectively constructed for characterizing the equilibrium conditions under both discretely and continuously distributed driving ranges  for deriving the equilibrium flow solutions for these problem cases  we suggested different adaptations of a well known path based algorithm the projected gradient method  while the problem instance with a discrete number of driving ranges can be simply treated as a multi class version of its deterministic counterpart  the one with continuous driving ranges poses a much more complicated situation  to overcome this arising modeling and algorithmic complication  we introduce a couple of newly defined variables  namely  path indexed travel subdemand rate and traffic subflow rate  by which the demand and flow rates as well as their corresponding feasible path sets can be dynamically indexed in the solution process with reference to path lengths  an illustrative example with various types and forms of driving range distributions demonstrates the applicability of the proposed modeling and solution methods and various impacts of the heterogeneity of range anxiety on network flows and computational costs  the numerical analysis results from this example show that stochastic driving ranges confine network flows in a different way from deterministic or no driving ranges and the projected gradient procedure relying on dynamically indexed subdemand and subflow rates is generally preferable to its counterpart on pre indexed ones for both the discrete and continuous driving range cases  2017 elsevier ltd  all rights reserved  
 patterns of entry and exit in the deregulated german interurban bus industry we study patterns of entry and exit in the german interurban bus industry in the first three years after its deregulation in january 2013  using a comprehensive data set of all firm and route entries and exits  we find that the industry grew much quicker than originally expected with particularly a few new entrants being most successful in quickly extending their route networks from regional to national coverage  although the clear majority of routes is operated on a monopoly basis  competition does play a key role on routes with a sufficiently large base of  potential  customers  from a spatial perspective  three years after deregulation  the entire interurban bus network connects 60 percent of all 644 larger german cities with the intensity of entry being dependent on the number of inhabitants  average income  the share of under 24 years old and the presence of intermodal competition by intercity railway services  
 peak car and increasing rebound  a closer look at car travel trends in great britain this paper uses econometric analysis of aggregate time series data to explore how different factors have influenced the demand for car travel in great britain since 1970 and how the rebound effect has changed over that time  our results suggest that changes in income  the fuel cost of driving and the level of urbanisation largely explain travel trends over this period   with recent reductions in car travel  peak car  being driven by a combination of the rising fuel cost of driving  increased urbanisation and the economic difficulties created by the 2008 financial crisis  we find some evidence that the proportion of licensed drivers has influenced aggregate travel trends  but no evidence that growing income inequality and the diffusion of ict technology have played a role  our results also suggest that the rebound effect from improved fuel efficiency has averaged 26  over this period and that the magnitude of this effect has increased over time  however  methodological and data limitations constrain the level of confidence that we can have in these results   c  2017 the authors  published by elsevier ltd  
 pedestrian crossing in urban ghana  safety implications pedestrian fatalities constitute 42  of road traffic fatalities in ghana  and 68  of the total pedestrian fatalities are related to pedestrian crossing facilities and behaviour  this study examines the state of pedestrian crossing facilities  crosswalks  and behaviour on urban roads in ghana  and its consequences on pedestrian safety  using new juaben municipality as a case study area  a 5 year road traffic collision data  information on the condition and utilisation of crosswalks and pedestrians  perceptions of crosswalks located at different land uses were collected and analysed  findings show that 98  of pedestrian collisions occurred in locations further away from crosswalks  in addition  accessibility of the crosswalks was a challenge to many urban residents  particularly the disabled  children and pregnant women  pedestrian behaviour was found to be central to the numbers and extent of pedestrian collisions  major factors associated with pedestrian behaviour include time of walking  fatigue  place of walking  inappropriate crossing points and the influence of alcohol and drugs  this study concludes that pedestrian safety appurtenances should be installed to encourage pedestrian and driver compliance  as well as public education campaigns to encourage behavioural change amongst pedestrians and drivers   c  2016 elsevier ltd all rights reserved  
 pedestrian falls  a review of the literature and future research directions introduction  pedestrian falls  pfs    falls in public spaces without collisions with other road users   are a significant cause of serious transport related injuries  amounting to three quarters of all pedestrians admitted to hospital  methods  this scoping review examined peer reviewed research on pfs published between 1995 and 2015  electronic databases  scopus  safetylit  and pubmed  were used to find studies identifying pfs or outdoor falls  the latter also including falls in gardens   results  we identified only 28 studies reporting relevant information on pfs  i e   15 prospective  10 retrospective  and 3 intervention studies   the results show that more walking is related to a lower risk of pfs  older people  especially older women  have a higher risk of  injurious  pfs  outdoor fall victims have equally good or better health characteristics and scores on balance tests compared to those who have not experienced such falls  road factors such as uneven surfaces  busy junctions  stairs  and slippery surfaces seem to play an important role in pfs  but much of the research on these factors is of a qualitative nature  conclusions  pf victims are generally in good health  apart from normal age related problems  but at risk due to road factors  practical applications  we recommend to adopt a human factors approach  the road system should be adapted to human capabilities and limitations including those of pedestrians  measures such as preventing uneven surfaces and good winter maintenance seem to be effective  however  we advise more quantitative research on road factors to inform design guidelines and standards for public space authorities given the qualitative nature of current research on road factors   c  2017 national safety council and elsevier ltd  all rights reserved  
 pedestrian fatality and impact speed squared  cloglog modeling from french national data objective  the present study estimates pedestrians  risk of death according to impact speed when hit by a passenger car in a frontal collision methods  data were coded for all fatal crashes in france in 2011 and for a random sample of 1 20th of all road injuries for the same year and weighted to take into account police underreporting of mild injury  a cloglog model was used to optimize risk adjustment for high collision speeds  the fit of the model on the data was also improved by using the square of the impact speed  which best matches the energy dissipated in the collision results  modeling clearly demonstrated that the risk of death was very close to 1 when impact speeds exceeded 80km h  for speeds less than 40km h  because data representative of all crashes resulting in injury were used  the estimated risk of death was fairly low  however  although the curve seemed deceptively flat below 50km h  the risk of death in fact rose 2 fold between 30 and 40km h and 6 fold between 30 and 50km h  for any given speed  the risk of death was much higher for more elderly subjects  especially those over 75years of age  these results concern frontal crashes involving a passenger car  collisions involving trucks are far less frequent  but half result in the pedestrian being run over  incurring greater mortality conclusions  for impact speeds below 60km h  the shape of the curve relating probability of death to impact speed was very similar to those reported in recent rigorous studies  for higher impact speeds  the present model allows the curve to rise ever more steeply  giving a much better fit to observed data  the present results confirm that  when a pedestrian is struck by a car  impact speed is a major risk factor  thus providing a supplementary argument for strict speed limits in areas where pedestrians are highly exposed  
 pedestrian flows through a narrow doorway  effect of individual behaviours on the global flow and microscopic dynamics we study the dynamics of pedestrian flows through a narrow doorway by means of controlled experiments  the influence of the pedestrians  behaviours is investigated by prescribing a selfish attitude to a fraction c s  of the participants  while the others behave politely  thanks to an original setup enabling the re injection of egressed participants into the room  the analysis is conducted in a  macroscopically  quasi stationary regime  we find that  as c s  is increased  the flow rate j rises  interpolating between published values for egresses in normal conditions and measurements for competitive evacuations  the dependence of several flow properties on the pedestrian density rho at the door  independently of cs  suggests that macroscopically the behavioural aspects could be subsumed under the density  at least in our specific settings with limited crowd pressure  in particular  under these conditions  j grows monotonically with rho up to  close packing   p approximate to 9m  2    the flow is then characterised microscopically  among other quantities  the time lapses between successive escapes  the pedestrians  waiting times in front of the door  and their angles of incidence are analysed statistically  in a nutshell  our main results show that the flow is orderly for polite crowds  with narrowly distributed time lapses between egresses  while for larger c s  the flow gets disorderly and vanishing time lapses emerge  for all c s   we find an alternation between short and long time lapses  which we ascribe to a generalised zipper effect  the average waiting time in the exit zone increases with its occupancy  the disorder in the flow and the pressure felt by participants are also assessed   c  2017 elsevier ltd  all rights reserved  
 pedestrian driver communication and decision strategies at marked crossings the aim of this work is to describe pedestrian driver encounters  communication  and decision strategies at marked but unsignalised crossings in urban areas in the czech republic and the ways in which the parties involved experience and handle these encounters  a mixed methods design was used  consisting of focus groups with pedestrians and drivers regarding their subjective views of the situations  on site observations  camera recordings  speed measurements  the measurement of car and pedestrian densities  and brief on site interviews with pedestrians  in close correspondence with the literature  our study revealed that the most relevant predictors of pedestrians  and drivers  behaviour at crossings were the densities of car traffic and pedestrian flows and car speed  the factors which influenced pedestrians  wait go behaviour were  car speed  the distance of the car from the crossing  traffic density  whether there were cars approaching from both directions  various signs given by the driver  eye contact  waving a hand  flashing their lights   and the presence of other pedestrians  the factors influencing drivers  yield go behaviour were  speed  traffic density  the number of pedestrians waiting to cross  and pedestrians being distracted  a great proportion of drivers  36   failed to yield to pedestrians at marked crossings  the probability of conflict situations increased with cars travelling at a higher speed  higher traffic density  and pedestrians being distracted by a different activity while crossing  the findings of this study can add to the existing literature by helping to provide an understanding of the perception of encounter situations by the parties involved and the motives lying behind certain aspects of behaviour associated with these encounters  this seems necessary in order to develop suggestions for improvements  for instance  the infrastructure near pedestrian crossings should be designed in such a way as to take proper account of pedestrians  needs to feel safe and comfortable  as well as ensuring their objective safety  thus  improvements should include measures aimed at reducing the speed of approaching vehicles  e g  humps  speed cushions  elevated crossings  early yield bars  and narrow lanes   as this would enhance yielding by motor vehicles  other measures that specifically rely on the subjective perception of different situations by the parties involved include the education and training of drivers  the aim of which is to promote their understanding and appreciation of pedestrians  needs and motives   c  2017 elsevier ltd  all rights reserved  
 perceived barriers to bicycling in an urban us environment prior research has identified several barriers influencing decisions to bicycle  including infrastructure  safety  and environmental factors  there is scant research exploring how sex and ridership status correlate with perceived barriers  which is a known barrier to being physically active  a total of 1334 baltimore city residents aged 18 to 75 participated in an online survey  february march 2014  assessing the major barriers to bicycling in the city  differences by sex and ridership status were examined independently and interactively  most respondents were women  60   and not regular riders  66    safety due to traffic was the biggest barrier for non riding women  77   and non riding men  54    weather was the biggest barrier for riding women  55   and riding men  51    followed by safety due to drivers  45  and 33   respectively   sex and ridership differences were also found for barriers regarding preference and logistics of transport  for example  riders had lower odds than non riders of rating biking as less comfortable than driving as a major barrier  or   0 39  p   0 01  furthermore  women had greater odds than men of rating it is difficult to carry things on a bike as a major barrier  or   1 65  p   0 01  interactions between sex and ridership status revealed that riding women had lower odds than riding men of rating a  needing others to travel  or   0 32 and b  hygiene  or   0 41  as major barriers  p s   0 05  we discuss these findings in the broader context of the literature  and offer strategies for addressing specific barriers to bicycling  
 perceived quality of urban public transport  use and willingness to pay in italian regions this paper focuses on various aspects of perceived quality of lpt services and the relation among quality  use and satisfaction with the ticket price  elaborating data provided by istat in the 2013 survey  aspects of daily life   we develop an indicator of perceived quality of urban public transport  measuring the progress made at the regional level in last ten years  following a customer based approach  we consider the opinions of the users on the service and formalize a methodology to compare an indicator over time  through a structured approach that can be replicated in different urban contexts  the survey results highlight  i  an increase in the overall levels of user satisfaction in italy between the first observation  2002  and the second one  2012    ii  a very limited relation between perceived quality and use both in the first and in the second year of observation   iii  a positive and increasingly strong relation between perceived quality and satisfaction with the ticket price  finally   iv  no relation between the satisfaction with the ticket price and the use of local public transport in both years considered  this work aims to suggest effective ideas for action to lpt companies and public administration  by breaking up the abstract and all encompassing concept of quality into its single constituents  and analysing them more precisely  on the foreground we put the concept of mobility as a  system  and not as a loose set of individual components  
 perceptual training to increase drivers  ability to spot motorcycles at t junctions motorcyclists too often collide with other road users who pull out of side roads in front of them  these other road users typically report making all the necessary visual checks  despite failing to see the approaching motorcycle  these look but fail to see errors appear to be attenuated in road users who themselves have motorcycling experience  suggesting that motorcycle exposure may lower thresholds for spotting these vulnerable road users through natural perceptual learning  this raises the possibility that perceptual training could improve car drivers  abilities to spot motorcycles  two experiments are reported  the first experiment demonstrated that a t junction task  requiring participants to detect an approaching vehicle in briefly displayed images  was sensitive to participants  motorcycle experience  with dual drivers  who both ride motorcycles and drive cars  performing better than average car drivers  following this  a second experiment split the car drivers into 2 groups  one group undertook a pelmanism task requiring participants to match pairs of motorcycles  while the control group had to match pairs of fruit  when the two groups were re tested on the t junction task  the group who had undergone perceptual training for motorcycles via the pelmanism task  were better able to identify approaching motorcycles  but not approaching cars  the results suggest that gamification of perceptual training for motorcycle detection provides a novel opportunity to improve driver safety   c  2017 elsevier ltd  all rights reserved  
 performance of basic kinematic thresholds in the identification of crash and near crash events within naturalistic driving data understanding causal factors for traffic safety critical events  e g   crashes and near crashes  is an important step in reducing their frequency and severity  naturalistic driving data offers unparalleled insight into these factors  but requires identification of situations where crashes are present within large volumes of data  sensitivity and specificity of these identification approaches are key to minimizing the resources required to validate candidate crash events  this investigation used data from the second strategic highway research program naturalistic driving study  shrp 2 nds  and the canada naturalistic driving study  cnds  to develop and validate different kinematic thresholds that can be used to detect crash events  results indicate that the sensitivity of many of these approaches can be quite low  but can be improved by selecting particular threshold levels based on detection performance  additional improvements in these approaches are possible  and may involve leveraging combinations of different detection approaches  including advanced statistical techniques and artificial intelligence approaches  additional parameter modifications  and automation of validation processes   c  2017 elsevier ltd  all rights reserved  
 pickup and delivery service with manpower planning in hong kong public hospitals this paper deals with a real life healthcare problem derived from the non emergency ambulance transfer service for hong kong public hospitals which provides transportation services for disabled or elderly patients between their residences and clinics  the problem is modeled as a multitrip pickup and delivery problem with time windows and manpower planning  mtpdptw mp  that not only needs to design and schedule ambulance routes satisfying a series of constraints but also requires staff scheduling  because of the strict limits on route duration  each ambulance traverses several routes per day  which  starting and terminating at the depot  complete a series of pickup and delivery operations to serve the clients  a feasible route demands a driver and several assistants to serve the clients and needs to satisfy some constraints  such as capacity  pickup before delivery  time windows  etc  the objective is hierarchical in that it primarily serves as many clients as possible  then minimizes the operational cost  and finally strikes a balance for the staff workload  theoretically  mtpdptw mp  which is a combination of two well known np hard problems  i e   the pickup and delivery problem with time windows and the staff scheduling problem   is difficult to solve  in this study  we propose an iterated local search metaheuristic that uses a variable neighborhood descent procedure in the local search phase  we use a modified regret insertion method to construct solutions  a heuristic backtracking algorithm is designed to schedule staff  to speed up the process  we adapt the segment based evaluation for moves and reduce the neighborhoods explored based on the characteristics of the problem  the effectiveness of the proposed algorithm was tested in real world instances  results showed that it can serve more requests than the manually designed plans  in addition  the performance of the proposed algorithm was evaluated on a simplified problem  the multitrip vehicle routing problem with time windows  
 pilots using selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors compared to other fatally injured pilots selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors  ssri  were a disqualifying medication for u s  civil pilots before april 5  2010  after this date  a federal aviation administration policy was created that allowed airmen  on select ssris  a pathway to hold a valid medical certificate  the purpose of this study was to provide a detailed look at ssris in the u s  pilot population since the inception of this new policy  we examined the toxicology results from fatally injured airmen in addition to outcomes concerning pilots who are participating in the program  this study examined data from the civil aerospace medical institute s bioaeronautical sciences research laboratory in conjunction with the medical analysis tracking registry and the document imaging and workflow system  a count based regression model quantified the relationships between positive ssri findings with additional factors of interest  these factors included pilot rating  ethanol  and first generation antihistamines  there were 1484 fatally injured airmen over the six year study period  of which 44 tested positive for an ssri  first generation antihistamines were statistically associated with positive findings of ssris  
 policy entrepreneurs and opportunities  establishing a model of policy change through bicycle infrastructure at the municipal level although bicycling has been the subject of increasing academic attention  particularly in the areas of mode choice  benefit analyses  and discussions of policies treatments  much less attention has been devoted to actually studying how communities have made decisions about whether and what they will implement in regards to bicycle infrastructure   policy entrepreneurs  are theorized as actors centrally responsible for either creating an opportunity or capitalizing on an opportunity to pair a public problem with a policy solution  a survey instrument solicited directly the participation of the 200 most populous municipalities within the united states  using a variety of analytical tools  and merged data sources  a model of municipal transportation policy change is developed that contributes an important perspective to the existing paradigm of policy process theory  neither individual policy entrepreneurs nor their role or qualities were not significant effectors of change  despite being regularly present  however  where networks of supportive actors  including strong champions policy entrepreneurs  were present they played a critical role in making projects happen and at larger scales  this finding puts additional emphasis moving forward on the collaborative nature of municipal policy change  advocates and planners may be more successful by being attuned to these networks and political contexts and taking advantage of open  windows  of engagement  or by  manually  opening these windows  lastly  city population was also associated with implementation  suggesting underlying factors to be explored in the future   c  2017 elsevier ltd  all rights reserved  
 policy insights and modelling challenges  the case of passenger car powertrain technology transition in the european union purpose we are interested in what policy insights can be transferred from eu countries that have been most successful in introducing evs to those that are debating policy options  as we use a model to explore this  we are also interested in the application of modelling  seeking to understand if real world policies and results can be replicated in a model and  more generally  the challenges to the use of modelling in policy appraisal  methods we use the ec jrc powertrain technology transition market agent model  pttmam   a system dynamics model based around the interactions of conceptual market agent groups in the eu  we perform iterative scenario tests to replicate the policies carried out in the netherlands and the uk in recent years in an attempt to achieve similar results in ev sales  we then transfer the policy scenarios to other eu member states and assess the transferability of the policies  results reasonable approximations of the netherlands and uk ev policies and sales were achieved and implemented in other eu member states  conclusion we find that the pttmam is fit for purpose and can replicate successful policies to a certain degree  policy success is sensitive to country specific conditions  and a system dynamics model like the pttmam can help identify which conditions react to which policy stimulus  there are challenges to modelling in policy appraisal  such as the subjectivity of the modeller and flexibility to specific conditions  which must be kept transparent for the model to be a relevant tool for policy making  
 population growth  accessibility spillovers and persistent borders  historical growth in west european municipalities lack of cross border transport supply has repeatedly been blamed for the fact that national borders limit spatial interaction and  consequently  the growth of border regions  this study applies an accessibility approach to investigate for most municipalities in ten countries in mainland west europe if foreign transport supply is lagging behind  and if population growth in these municipalities has been affected by the limits that national borders have imposed on market access  to do so  data describing historical population changes and road networks between 1961 and 2011 have been used  the results show that in the study area  cross border transport accessibility was not at a disadvantage in 1961 and has since then grown even more than domestic accessibility  however  municipal population growth has depended almost exclusively on domestic market access  processes of economic international integration in the study area are found to coincide with the growth of cross border accessibility  but do not have a clear coincidence with the effects of cross border accessibility on population growth  
 pre crash scenarios at road junctions  a clustering method for car crash data given the recent advancements in autonomous driving functions  one of the main challenges is safe and efficient operation in complex traffic situations such as road junctions  there is a need for comprehensive testing  either in virtual simulation environments or on real world test tracks  this paper presents a novel data analysis method including the preparation  analysis and visualization of car crash data  to identify the critical pre crash scenarios at t  and four legged junctions as a basis for testing the safety of automated driving systems  the presented method employs k medoids to cluster historical junction crash data into distinct partitions and then applies the association rules algorithm to each cluster to specify the driving scenarios in more detail  the dataset used consists of 1056 junction crashes in the uk  which were exported from the in depth  on the spot  database  the study resulted in thirteen crash clusters for t junctions  and six crash clusters for crossroads  association rules revealed common crash characteristics  which were the basis for the scenario descriptions  the results support existing findings on road junction accidents and provide benchmark situations for safety performance tests in order to reduce the possible number parameter combinations  
 pre disaster investment decisions for strengthening the chinese railway system under earthquakes this study proposes a framework to determine the investment plan to strengthen a railway system which is subject to earthquake hazard  the proposed framework includes four parts   1  construct a two layer  physical layer and service layer  railway network representation   2  generate earthquake scenarios based on historical earthquake data   3  formulate an investment optimization model to minimize the expected railway system service loss subjected to an investment budget constraint  where the service loss is quantified based on the affected train flow   4  solve the optimization model by using genetic algorithm  taking the chinese railway system  crs  as an example  the proposed framework has been applied and the results show that the solution of the proposed framework is more responsive to the earthquake impact on railway system compared to topology based methods  note that the proposed framework can also be extended to identify pre disaster investment plans for other transportation systems under natural disasters   c  2017 elsevier ltd  all rights reserved  
 predicting car drivers  intention to use low cost airlines for intercity travel in libya this study used an extended version of the theory of planned behaviour  tpb  to predict the travel intention of car drivers in libya with regard to using the new low cost carriers  lcc   in order to understand the willingness of travelleis to accept the lcc in libya and its antecedents  this study has added three constructs to the original tpb model  namely novelty seeking  trust  and external influences  the respondents in this study are 338 car drivers in libya  the results of this study indicate that attitude towards lcc  perceived behavioural control  and subjective norm all have positive effects on the behavioural intention of taking lcc  furthermore  novelty seeking and trust have indirect positive effects on behavioural intention  trust  on the other hand  has an indirect positive influence on the three antecedents of intention in accepting lcc in libya  results also revealed that external influence  i e  advertising campaigns by the media  has a significant indirect influence on car users  intention to accept the new lcc via subjective norm and perceived behavioural control  and indirect influence on the behaviour intention of car users via novelty seeking with regard to attitude towards lcc and trust to perceived behavioural control   c  2017 elsevier ltd  all rights reserved  
 predicting cost escalation pathways and deviation severities of infrastructure projects using risk based econometric models and monte carlo simulation in the past decade  infrastructure related legislation in the united states has consistently emphasized the need to measure the variation associated with infrastructure project cost estimates  such cost variability is best viewed from the perspective of the project development phases and how the project cost estimate changes as it evolves across these phases  the article first identifies a few gaps in the cost overrun literature  then it introduces a methodology that uses risk based multinomial models and monte carlo simulation involving random draws to predict the probability that a project will follow a particular cost escalation pathway across its development phases and that it will incur a given level of cost deviation severity  the article then uses historical data to demonstrate how infrastructure agencies could apply the proposed methodology  statistical models are developed to estimate the probability that a highway project will follow any specific cost escalation pathway and ultimately  a given direction and severity of cost deviation  the case study results provided some interesting insights  for a given highway functional class  larger project sizes are associated with lower probability of underestimating the final cost  however  such a trend is not exhibited by very large projects  total cost exceeding  30m   for a given project size  higher class roads were generally observed to have a lower probability of underestimating the final cost  compared to lower class roads and this gap in probability narrows as the project size increases  it was determined that a project s most likely pathway of cost escalation is not a guarantee that it will yield any particular direction of cost deviation  the case study results also confirmed the findings of a few past studies that the probabilities of cost escalation pathways and the cost overruns differ significantly across highway districts  and attributed this to differences in administrative culture and work practices across the districts  infrastructure managers can use the developed methodology to identify which projects are likely to experience a particular pathway of cost escalation  the direction and severity of cost deviation  and to develop more realistic project contingency estimates  
 predicting motorcycle crash injury severity using weather data and alternative bayesian multivariate crash frequency models motorcycle crashes constitute a very high proportion of the overall motor vehicle fatalities in the united states  and many studies have examined the influential factors under various conditions  however  research on the impact of weather conditions on the motorcycle crash severity is not well documented  hi this study  we examined the impact of weather conditions on motorcycle crash injuries at four different severity levels using san francisco motorcycle crash injury data  five models were developed using full bayesian formulation accounting for different correlations commonly seen in crash data and then compared for fitness and performance  results indicate that the models with serial and severity variations of parameters had superior fit  and the capability of accurate crash prediction  the inferences from the parameter estimates from the five models were  an increase in the air temperature reduced the possibility of a fatal crash but had a reverse impact on crashes of other severity levels  humidity in air was not observed to have a predictable or strong impact on crashes  the occurrence of rainfall decreased the possibility of crashes for all severity levels  transportation agencies might benefit from the research results to improve road safety by providing motorcyclists with information regarding the risk of certain crash severity levels for special weather conditions  
 predicting tanker freight rates using parsimonious variables and a hybrid artificial neural network with an adaptive genetic algorithm short term prediction of tanker freight rates  tfrs  is strategically important to stakeholders in the oil shipping industry  this study develops a hybrid tfr prediction model based on an artificial neural network  ann  and an adaptive genetic algorithm  aga   the aga adaptively searches satisficing network parameters such as input delay size  the ann iteratively optimizes a prediction network considering parsimonious variables and time lag effects as predictors  three parsimonious variables  crude oil price  fleet productivity and bunker price  are selected by a stepwise regression of tfr variables  the article compares the performance of its hybrid model with two traditional approaches  regression and moving average   as well as with the findings of existing ann studies  the results of our model  root mean squared error  rmse   11 2 ws  are not only significantly superior to the regression approach  rmse   21 6 ws  and the moving average approach  rmse   17 5 ws   but are even slightly superior to the results of existing ann studies  rmse   14 6 ws 15 8 ws   
 predicting the potential market for electric vehicles forecasting the potential demand for electric vehicles is a challenging task  because most studies for new technologies rely on stated preference  sp  data  market share predictions will reflect shares in the sp data and not in the real market  moreover  typical disaggregate demand models are suitable to forecast demand in relatively stable markets  but show limitations in the case of innovations  when predicting the market for new products it is crucial to account for the role played by innovation and how it penetrates the new market over time through a diffusion process  however  typical diffusion models in marketing research use fairly simple demand models  in this paper we discuss the problem of predicting market shares for new products and suggest a method that combines advanced choice models with a diffusion model to take into account that new products often need time to gain a significant market share  we have the advantage of a relatively unique databank where respondents were submitted to the same stated choice experiment before and after experiencing an electric vehicle  results show that typical choice models forecast a demand that is too restrictive in the long period  accounting for the diffusion effect  instead allows predicting the usual slow penetration of a new product in the initial years after product launch and a faster market share increase after diffusion takes place  
 predicting upcoming values of stress while driving the levels of stress while driving affect the way we drive and have an impact on the likelihood of having an accident  different types of sensors  such as heart rate or skin conductivity sensors  have been previously used to measure stress related features  estimated stress levels could be used to adapt the driver s environment to minimize distractions in high cognitive demanding situations and to promote stress friendly driving behaviors  the way we drive has an impact on how stressors affect the perceived cognitive demands by drivers  and at the same time  the perceived stress has an impact on the actions taken by the driver  in this paper  we evaluate how effectively upcoming stress levels can be predicted considering current stress levels  current driving behavior  and the shape of the road  we use features  such as the positive kinetic energy and severity of curves on the road to estimate how stress levels will evolve in the next minute  different machine learning techniques are evaluated and the results for both intra and inter city driving and for both intra and inter driver data are presented  we have used data from four different drivers with three different car models and a motorbike and more than 220 test drives  results show that upcoming stress levels can be accurately predicted for a single user   correlation r   0 99 and classification accuracy 97 5   but prediction for different users is more limited   correlation r   0 92 and classification accuracy 46 9    
 predicting workers  compensation claims and disciplinary actions using securefit  r    further support for integrative models of workplace safety introduction  a growing body of applied research has identified certain psychological traits that are predictive of worker safety  however  most of these studies suffer from an overreliance on common method bias caused by self report measures of both   a  personal factors such as personality traits  and  b  outcomes such as safety behaviors and injuries  method  this study utilized archival data from 796 employees at a large u s  automobile manufacturer  data were gathered on a pre employment assessment  securefit  r   that measured key personality characteristics such as conscientiousness  locus of control  and risk taking  in addition  objective measures of workers  compensation claims and disciplinary actions were also gathered  results  the results indicated that disciplinary actions and workers  compensation claims were strongly correlated  it also demonstrated that the pre employment assessment was able to predict both disciplinary actions and workers  compensation claims up to 12 months in the future  screening out just 8  of the applicant sample using the assessment would have resulted in a 35  reduction in disciplinary actions and 46  in workers  compensation claims  respectively  conclusions  the study found a very strong relationship between counterproductive work behaviors  cwbs   such as not following rules  and workers  compensation claims  it also found a strong relationship between a combination of personality traits that have been shown to be associated with both variables  although the current study was able to demonstrate that relationship with objective measure of both variables  practical applications  individuals who receive disciplinary actions for things such as not following rules  not coming to work on time  etc  are significantly more likely to also be involved in serious safety incidents  and vice versa  identifying those individuals early on in the hiring process and screening them out can significantly reduce the number of cwbs as well as workers  compensation claims   c  2017 national safety council and elsevier ltd  all rights reserved  
 predictors of driving outcomes including both crash involvement and driving cessation in a prospective study of japanese older drivers the first aim of this study was to investigate predictors of future traffic crash involvement  taking into account bias in the handling of data for former drivers  the second aim was to compare characteristics of former drivers and crash involved drivers in order to gain an understanding of appropriate driving cessation among older drivers  in all  154 drivers aged 70 years or older participated in the baseline interview and the follow up survey conducted two years later  in the baseline interview  participants were asked to respond to a questionnaire  take the useful field of view test center dot   ufov   and complete the mini mental state examination  in the follow up survey  participants were asked by mail or telephone whether they had stopped driving  participants reporting that they still drove were invited to participate in a subsequent interview  based on the information obtained in the follow up survey  participants were classified as follows  driving cessation group  n   26   crash involved group  n   18   and crash free group  n   110   a multinomial logistic regression was then used to analyse the data  contrary to the results of previous studies  we found older age to be associated with crash involvement but not with driving cessation  the cessation group had more decreased cognitive processing speed than the crash involved and crash free groups  crash history was also predictive of crash involvement  participants who were subject to license renewal between baseline and follow up had a greater tendency to continue driving  results suggested that age and crash history could potentially identify high risk older drivers  the predictive power of cognitive processing speed is reduced under certain conditions  license renewal procedures may induce japanese older adults to continue driving  future studies should use a large national sample to confirm the results of the present study  
 predictors of recovery in cyclists hospitalised for orthopaedic trauma following an on road crash background  as cycling related injury rates are on the rise  there is a need to understand the long term outcomes of these patients in order to quantify the burden of injury and to inform injury prevention strategies  this study aimed to investigate predictors of return to work and functional recovery in a cohort of cyclists hospitalised for orthopaedic trauma from crashes occurring on road  methods  a retrospective analysis of data from the victorian orthopaedic trauma outcomes registry motor  was conducted for patients who were hospitalised for orthopaedic trauma following a cycling crash that occurred on road between july 2007 and june 2015  results  there were 1787 injured cyclists admitted at the participating hospitals  most cyclists were male  79    resided in major cities  89   and were in the highest socioeconomic quintile  52    the majority of crashes were either non collisions  41   or collisions with a motor vehicle  35    a smaller proportion of cyclists who collided with motor vehicles had returned to work and had returned to pre injury functional levels at 12 months post injury  when compared to collisions with other impact counterparts and non collisions  mixed effects logistic regression models revealed that compensable patients demonstrated lower odds of complete functional recovery and return to work when compared with non compensable patients  conclusion  cyclists who collided with motor vehicles had worse outcomes compared to crashes with other impact counterparts and non collision events  these findings provide support for reducing the potential for interaction between cyclists and motor vehicles  
 prevalence of complete streets policies in us municipalities communities can adopt complete streets policies to support physical activity through the routine design and operation of streets and communities that are safe for all people  regardless of age  ability  or mode of transport  our aim was two fold   1  to estimate the prevalence of complete streets policies in the united states overall and by select municipality characteristics using data from the national survey of community based policy and environmental supports for healthy eating and active living  cbs heal  and  2  examine the agreement between information about local policies reported in cbs heal with those found in the national complete streets coalition s database  data from a representative sample of incorporated u s  municipalities with a population of at least 1000 people  n   2029  were analyzed using survey weights to create national estimates  in 2014  25 2  of municipalities had a complete streets policy reported by a local official  prevalence of local policies decreased with decreasing population size and was lower among those with a lower median education level and those in the south  with and without adjustment for other municipality characteristics  agreement between local complete streets policies reported in cbs heal and the coalition s database was moderate with 72 5  agreement  kappa   0 21   however  agreement was lower for municipalities with smaller populations  those located in rural areas  and those with a lower median education level  about 16 8  of local officials reported they did not know if their municipality had such a policy  there is room for improvement in the awareness and adoption of complete streets policies in the united states  especially among smaller municipalities and those with lower median education levels  helping communities address issues related to the awareness  adoption  and implementation of complete streets policies can be an important step toward creating more walkable communities  published by elsevier ltd  
 pricing scheme design of ridesharing program in morning commute problem this paper examines the dynamic user equilibrium of the morning commute problem in the presence of ridesharing program  commuters simultaneously choose departure time from home and commute mode among three roles  solo driver  ridesharing driver  and ridesharing rider  considering the congestion evolution over time  we propose a time varying compensation scheme to maintain a positive ridesharing ridership at user equilibrium  to match the demand and the supply of ridesharing service over time  the compensation scheme should be set according to the inconvenience cost functions and the out of pocket cost functions  when the price charged per time unit is higher than the inconvenience cost per time unit perceived by the ridesharing drivers  the ridesharing participants will travel at the center of peak hours and solo drivers will commute at the two tails  within the feasible region with positive ridership  the ridesharing program can reduce the congestion and all the commuters will be better off  to support system optimum  so   we derive a time varying toll combined with a flat ridesharing price from eliminating queuing delay  under so toll  the ridesharing program can attract more participants and have an enlarged feasible region  this reveals that the commuters are more tolerant to the inconvenience caused by sharing a ride at so because of the lower travel time  compared with no toll equilibrium  both overall congestion and individual travel cost are further reduced at so   c  2017 elsevier ltd  all rights reserved  
 prioritizing influential factors for freeway incident clearance time prediction using the gradient boosting decision trees method identifying and quantifying the influential factors on incident clearance time can benefit incident management for accident causal analysis and prediction  and consequently mitigate the impact of non recurrent congestion  traditional incident clearance time studies rely on either statistical models with rigorous assumptions or artificial intelligence  ai  approaches with poor interpretability  this paper proposes a novel method  gradient boosting decision trees  gbdts   to predict the nonlinear and imbalanced incident clearance time based on different types of explanatory variables  the gbdt inherits both the advantages of statistical models and ai approaches  and can identify the complex and nonlinear relationship while computing the relative importance among variables  one year crash data from washington state  usa  incident tracking system are used to demonstrate the effectiveness of gbdt method  based on the distribution of incident clearance time  two groups are categorized for prediction with a 15 min threshold  a comparative study confirms that the gbdt method is significantly superior to other algorithms for incidents with both short and long clearance times  in addition  incident response time is found to be the greatest contributor to short clearance time with more than 41  relative importance  while traffic volume generates the second greatest impact on incident clearance time with relative importance of 27 34  and 19 56   respectively  
 proactive  backward analysis and learning in road probabilistic bayesian network models some probabilistic safety assessment models based on bayesian networks have been recommended recently for safety analysis of highways and roads  these methods provide a very natural and powerful alternative to traditional approaches  such as fault and event tree based methods  in this article  we present several new and original contributions to complement the inference engine tools of these models to provide new and relevant information about safety and backward analysis on one hand  and to learn the complex multidimensional joint probabilities of all variables  on the other hand  more precisely  we show how standard tools combined with the partitioning technique can be used in new ways to solve three relevant problems  1  to prognosticate the most probable combinations of variables leading to incidents   2  to perform a backward analysis to identify the causes of accidents  and  3  to learn the model parameters using bayesian conjugate methods  categorical and dirichlet families   finally  some real examples of applications are used to illustrate the proposed methods  
 probabilistic prediction of bus headway using relevance vector machine regression bus headway regularity heavily affects transit riders  attitude for choosing public transportation and also serves as an important indicator for transit performance evaluation  therefore  an accurate estimate of bus headway can benefit both transit riders and transit operators  this paper proposed a relevance vector machine  rvm  algorithm to predict bus headway by incorporating the time series of bus headways  travel time  and passenger demand at previous stops  different from traditional computational intelligence approaches  rvmcan output the probabilistic prediction result  in which the upper and lower bounds of a predicted headway within a certain probability are yielded  an empirical experiment with two bus routes in beijing  china  is utilized to confirm the high precision and strong robustness of the proposed model  five algorithms  support vector machine  svm   genetic algorithm svm  kalman filter  k nearest neighbor  and artificial neural network  are used for comparison with the rvm model and the result indicates that rvm outperforms these algorithms in terms of accuracy and confidence intervals  when the confidence level is set to 95   more than 95  of actual bus headways fall within the prediction bands  with the probabilistic bus headway prediction information  transit riders can better schedule their trips to avoid late and early arrivals at bus stops  while transit operators can adopt the targeted correction actions to maintain regular headway for bus bunching prevention  
 productivity growth in urban freight transport  an index number approach improvement of operational efficiency is a common goal of most governmental freight transport policies  productivity and efficiency analysis consequently provides a sound knowledge base  this paper illustrates how axiomatic production theory can be applied to model road freight transport  and proposes a logistics efficiency measure as the function representation  based thereon  a logistics productivity index that decomposes into technical  cargo mix  vehicle capacity  and efficiency changes is established to determine the rate and drivers of growth  emphasizing urban logistics  the paper discusses the limited access to reliable data at the micro level and illustrates how local or regional freight transport can be evaluated applying pseudo panel techniques to national freight surveys  correspondingly  the theoretical productivity index is implemented on a pseudo panel covering the 24 largest cities in norway between 2008 and 2012  when 12 of them entered a collaboration agreement to promote efficient transport  the results indicate a modest 0 6  average productivity growth  efficiency change is the key driver of growth  countered by technical stagnation and regress  negative productivity growth is expected if this trend continues  moreover  the results do not reveal productivity gains from urban agglomeration or membership of the collaboration agreement  suggesting that prevailing transport and land use policies have so far been unable to foster productivity growth in urban freight transport  
 profile of urban vs rural drivers detected drink driving via roadside breath testing  rbt  in queensland  australia  between 2000 and 2011 problem  in australia  as in many other countries  a disproportionate number of drink driving crashes occur on rural roads  aims and method  the study used queensland police random breath testing  rbt  data from 2000 2011 to  a  comparing drink driving rates and rbt efficacy in areas of increasing remoteness  b  compare drink driver factors and the circumstances of apprehensions in rural and urban areas  results  generally  rural areas had a higher detection rate per rbt intercepts and a greater number of apprehensions per licensed drivers than the state average  main effects showed that rural drivers were more likely to be male and to be a reoffender but less likely to be apprehended between midnight and 5 59 am and after visiting a licensed venue  urban drivers were more likely to be aged 17 49 years and to be apprehended with a bac  0 15   conclusion  differences in rbt effectiveness and drink driving factors and circumstances exist between rural and urban areas  practical application  the greater number of drink drivers in rural areas signal a need for targeted interventions in these areas  to increase the effectiveness of such interventions  further research should examine the mechanisms responsible for these observed differences between rural and urban drink driver   c  2017 elsevier ltd  all rights reserved

 projected prevalence of car sharing in four asian pacific countries in 2030  what the experts think this paper presents a  big picture view  for policymakers and related stakeholders regarding the future development of car sharing services  car sharing has the potential to significantly disrupt the personal mobility market  thus  understanding their market penetration and implications is urgently needed  previous studies in this domain have predominantly focused on the views  opinions  and preferences of consumers  in this study  we complement the current demand modelling research on car sharing by applying an expert elicitation and aggregation technique that relies on transport experts  opinions to investigate the role of car sharing in the future  specifically  based on the opinions of mobility suppliers  this research elicits experts  judgment from across government  industry  and academia to gain insights into the future of car sharing markets in four countries australia  malaysia  indonesia  and thailand  the analysis reveals that  from a mobility supplier s perspective  energy and vehicle prices will not have a statistically significant impact on the future adoption of car sharing  the results also show that the more knowledgeable an expert is  the more pessimistic they are about the market penetration of car sharing in 2016  and the more optimistic they are about the prevalence of car sharing in 2030   c  2017 elsevier ltd  all rights reserved  
 projecting impacts of two wheelers on urban air quality of douala  cameroon douala  one of the fastest developing cities of cameroon  has been experiencing unprecedented growth of two wheelers  motorbikes  and poor perceived air quality  the city has no air quality monitoring system and no air quality data  the only survey that reported the carbon monoxide  co  levels was carried out by the world bank under the clean air initiative in 2002 and another study of traffic counts in 2008  in this study  the world bank co concentration levels of 2002 have been validated by back projecting the 2008 traffic scenario using vehicular emission and line source dispersion models and future scenarios up to 2015 have been projected at one of the busiest traffic intersections  the potential impacts of euro emissions standards to improve the roadside air quality in douala were studied  the results showed that the co levels increased by a factor of 18 for a period from 2002 to 2015 with an annual increase of 65  in two wheelers and 31  in cars  the estimated population of two wheelers in 2015 was found to be 23 times higher than in 2002  which  by 2035  is expected to grow by 533  and the car ownership by 146   if euro ii and iii emissions standards are gradually implemented on two wheelers in cameroon  co levels along roadways are expected to be reduced by about 70   these results may be helpful to policy makers to prepare an air quality management plan for the city   c  2017 elsevier ltd  all rights reserved  
 promotion of active transportation among state departments of transportation in the u s objectives  this research aimed to assess the level of support for active transportation among state departments of transportation  dots  in the u s  methods  we conducted an inventory plans adopted by 51 state dots and a survey of state dot pedestrian and bicycle coordinators in the u s  in 2010  n 39  72  response rate   results  overall  the plans were not very encouraging of planning and design elements that would encourage walking and bicycling  only two items  establish pedestrian and bicycle facilities requirements and standards and safer intersections for pedestrians and bicyclists  were encouraged or required by at least half of the states  states were more supportive of including bicycle and pedestrian facilities  e g  trails  sidewalks  and bike lanes  and less supportive of policies related to land use and urban design and reallocating road space  e g  road diets or narrower streets   the overall levels of support were positively correlated to levels of urbanization  according to the state coordinators  support for bicycle and pedestrian projects and policies increased over time  but support is stronger among top management than highway engineering staff  funding was identified as the major implementation barrier  particularly in more rural states  conclusions  change within state dots to incorporate bicycle and pedestrian modes is a slow process  influenced by both management and engineering staff  education at several levels and through different mechanisms could play an important role in changing dot culture  though funding for projects is also a major barrier  effective advocacy groups may also play a positive role   c  2017 published by elsevier ltd  
 pss are more user friendly  but are they also increasingly useful  planning support systems  pss  can provide important and much needed knowledge and support in strategy making processes  by bringing explicit information to daily planning practices  however  as decades of academic studies show  their use is riddled with barriers and bottlenecks  academic studies generated insight in these bottlenecks and identified a number of directions to bridge the implementation gap  most notably  the transparency  flexibility and interactivity of pss needed to be enhanced to align the instruments more with the dynamic characteristics of urban strategy making processes  however  pss developers do not seek instrumental use only  they seek to increase the quality of planning through this use  accordingly  academic analysis should go beyond the user friendliness of the pss themselves  there are a number of studies that focus on the relations between pss and planning quality  this paper aims to construct links between these studies of usefulness and the body of knowledge on user friendliness  to do so  it operationalizes the characteristics of user friendliness and the potential added value that pss have on the qualities of planning  specifically the strategy making phases   consequently  the relations between these concepts are further explored  five experiments measured user friendliness and usefulness indicators of different pss and explored the relations between these two concepts  the findings indicate high user friendliness across the board  while usefulness was only found in very limited cases and for very limited dimensions  notably insight and consensus   the correlations between the perceived user friendliness and usefulness on different planning qualities reveal that for the self reported enthusiasm of participants all user friendliness indicators have a positive effect  for perceived gains in insight  only credibility and clarity of output have a significant positive effect   c  2016 published by elsevier ltd  
 pss  beyond the implementation gap in the last couple of decades  a large number of papers on planning support systems  pss  have been published in national and international  scientific and professional journals  what is remarkable about pss is that for quite some time their history has been dominated by an implementation gap  that is  a discrepancy between supply and demand  despite the availability of a growing number and diversity of potentially valuable pss instruments  planning practitioners are rather hesitant to buy  implement or apply them  this implementation gap leads to the question whether pss are a valuable tool for planning practice  in this commentary  i answer this question by taking a closer look at the pss debate from four perspectives  namely those of pss history  pss research  pss education and pss in practice  although these perspectives are closely related  i show that they also reveal different aspects of this issue  for each of these perspectives  i start with a hypothetical conclusion and present some of my underlying considerations  at the end of this contribution  i summarize the situation  finalize the hypothetical conclusions and provide some recommendations concerning the implerbentation gap  these include focusing on the positive rather than the negative  we should look at the success stories  successful or best practices  and try to learn from them  after all  the proof of the pudding is in the eating  furthermore  pss are by no means a panacea for all our problems or challenges in planning practice  in my opinion  selectivity in their application in actual planning practice evidences a growing maturity of the pss field   c  2016 elsevier ltd  all rights reserved  
 public infrastructure and regional growth  evidence from turkey the aim of this study is to examine the effects of public transportation infrastructure investments on regional economic growth in turkish nuts 2 regions between 2004 and 2011  to offer an advanced statistical analysis  we employ an augmented production function model for measuring the effects of different types of transportation infrastructure on regional output  we use specifically ordinary least squares  ols   fixed effects  two stage least squares  2sls  and hausman taylor iv estimation methods with both cross section and panel data  our results show that road and motorway infrastructure have strongly significant positive effects on regional output in all our estimations  land infrastructure is found to play a very important role in regional economic performance in turkey  while  somewhat surprisingly  air infrastructure has no significant impact on regional gva  which clearly suggests the existence of different types of transportation infrastructure in the turkish regions  also  the high growth elasticity of land infrastructure in the turkish regions indicates that turkey is currently still suffering from an inadequate transport infrastructure  
 public transport service quality elements based on real time operational tactics public transport  pt  real time control actions  such as daily implementation of operational tactics  play a vital role in service reliability because of allowing for improvement of the quality of service perceived by passengers  applying appropriate tactics leads to increased service reliability  reduced passenger waiting time  prevention of missed transfers and curtail passenger frustrations  to date  various studies have investigated the efficiency of using real time tactics and its effects on pt system performance  yet  passenger perception related to various operational tactics remains one of the most poorly understood aspects of pt operations  the purpose of this study is to cultivate an understanding of what constitutes pt service quality  sq  at the operational level  using real time operational tactics based on user centric performance measures  sq as a measure of serviceability in a pt system has been evaluated in relation to four definitive factors  performance  information  operational tactics  and travel time  a conjoint analysis combined with cluster analysis is developed to capture the most important factors in evaluating the sq process  two case studies  each from a different country  have been selected  one is at a major terminal in auckland  new zealand  and the other in lyon  france  the findings show which attributes are important in assessing sq and how they vary in importance in different case studies  
 punishing or subsidizing  regulation analysis of sustainable fashion procurement strategies in the recent years  the fashion and apparel industry has seen intense competition and increasing production quantity  along with growing concern about the sustainability issues and the environmental impacts  many companies in fashion supply chains have tried various approaches to be more  green   and procurement is one of the most important functions which influences supply chain sustainability  because procurement does not only affect the supply chain output but also change the supply chain structure  in this paper  we consider a typical fashion supply chain comprising of an apparel manufacturer  a retailer and a logistic service provider  lsp   where we analyze two commonly used procurement strategies  control and agency  we examine the effects of two widely used government regulations  punishing and subsidizing  on the management of sustainable fashion procurement  we show that  there exist conflicts between supply chain profit goals and sustainability goals  the retailer will obtain more profits under control  but the price is that it determines a larger order size and the supply chain becomes less sustainable  to improve sustainability  a local government can either punish or subsidize the retailer  we show that  punishing can only reduce the order size  while subsidizing may induce the retailer to change its procurement strategy from control to agency  when the subsidy exceeds a threshold  we also find that the objectives of improving sustainability and maximizing social welfare may be conflicting  so it is an important task to find a balance between them for the government  
 putting sustainability theory into roadway design practice  implementation of lca and lcca analysis for pavement type selection in real world decision making assessment of life cycle costs and environmental impacts of pavements has become an essential component of roadway design and asset management  the existing literature reveals that the economic and environmental sustainability of pavements depend on specific project characteristics  hence  recent studies have called for real world case studies of pavement construction projects to better understand how the life cycle costs and environmental impacts of pavements vary based on different project characteristics  to this end  present study conducted comprehensive lca and lcca analyses to investigate the sustain ability of different pavement alternatives for the sr 836 southwest extension project in miami  florida  the study considered the agency costs and impacts as well as various use phase impacts and costs including those connected with pavement vehicle interaction and work zone traffic delays  in addition  the uncertainty related to the costs and impacts of construction and maintenance activities was assessed  the results indicated that at 90  confidence interval the flexible pavement design has lower cost and environmental impacts in the construction phase  however  when all phases are taken into consideration  the rigid pavement alternatives have lower environmental impacts and costs  the analysis also examined the sensitivity of the results to different parameters such as the discount rate and future traffic growth rate  the results of the sensitivity analysis indicated that the flexible pavement design has lower agency costs compared to rigid pavements at discount rates less than 4   for discount rate values greater than 4 5   the rigid pavement leads to lower life cycle costs   c  2017 elsevier ltd  all rights reserved  
 qualifying information on deaths and serious injuries caused by road traffic in five brazilian capitals using record linkage introduction  road traffic crashes  rtc  are an important public health problem  accounting for 1 2 million deaths per year worldwide  in brazil  approximately 40 000 deaths caused by rtc occur every year  with different trends in the federal units  however  these figures may be even greater if health databases are linked to police records  in addition  the linkage procedure would make it possible to qualify information from the health and police databases  improving the quality of the data regarding underlying cause of death  cause of injury in hospital records  and injury severity  objective  this study linked different data sources to measure the numbers of deaths and serious injuries and to estimate the percentage of corrections regarding the underlying cause of death  cause of injury  and the severity injury in victims in matched pairs from record linkage in five representative state capitals of the five macro regions of brazil  methods  this cross sectional  population based study used data from the hospital information system  his   mortality information system  mis   and police road traffic database of belo horizonte  campo grande  curitiba  palmas  and teresina  for the year 2013 for teresina  and 2012 for the other capitals  reclink iii was used to perform probabilistic record linkage by identifying matched pairs to calculate the global correction percentage of the underlying cause of death  the circumstance that caused the road traffic injury  and the injury severity of the victims in the police database  results  there was a change in the cause of injury in the his  with an overall percentage of correction estimated at 24 4  for belo horizonte  96 9  for campo grande  100 0  for palmas  and 33 2  for teresina  the overall percentages of correction of the underlying cause of death in the mis were 29 9   11 9   4 2   and 33 5  for belo horizonte  campo grande  curitiba  and teresina  respectively  the correction of the classification of injury severity in police database were 100 0  for belo horizonte and teresina  48 0  for campo grande  and 51 4  for palmas after linkage with hospital database  the linkage between mortality and police database found a percentage of correction of 29 5   52 3   4 4   74 3 and 72 9  for belo horizonte  campo grande  palmas  curitiba and teresina  respectively in the police records  conclusions  the results showed the importance of linking records of the health and police databases for estimating the quality of data on road traffic injuries and the victims in the five capital cities studied  the true causes of death and degrees of severity of the injuries caused by rtc are underestimated in the absence of integration of health and police databases  thus  it is necessary to define national rules and standards of integration between health and traffic databases in national and state levels in brazil  
 quality of life following road traffic injury  a systematic literature review purpose  to assess and provide a systematic overview of current knowledge about the relationship between quality of life  qol  and road traffic injury  and to appraise how qol is affected by road traffic injury  methods  a systematic review of the literature published since 1990 on qol after a road traffic injury  including adult and paediatric populations  from three databases  pubmed  psychinfo and safetylit  was undertaken  the methodological quality was assessed according to the newcastle ottawa quality assessment scale  results  thirty articles were included and assessed for quality  the qol scores of those injured were similar to population norms at the first assessment  followed by a drop at the second assessment  an increase of qol from the second to third assessment was reported  but participants never reached the population norms at the last follow up  range six weeks to two years   with an exception of those claiming compensation and those with lower extremity fractures  age  gender  socioeconomic status  injury severity  injury type and post traumatic stress disorder were associated with reduced qol  conclusions  available literature regarding qol among injured in road traffic crashes is heterogeneous with regard to aims and tools used for assessment  our review confirmed that independent of measure  the overall qol was significantly reduced after a road traffic injury compared to the general population norms  persons who are older  of female gender  lower socioeconomic status  diagnosed with post traumatic stress disorder  with more severe injuries or injuries to the lower limbs are more vulnerable to loss of qol following road traffic injury compared to other patient groups injured in road traffic crashes  
 quantifying the environmental impacts of increasing high occupancy vehicle lanes in the united states to what extent will increasing high occupancy vehicle  hov  lane kilometer incentivize carpooling and reduce emissions of air pollutants and greenhouse gases  to answer these questions  we develop a multiple regression model relating hov lanes and other socioeconomic factors to carpooling propensity in all 50 u s  states and the district of columbia  then calculate the extent to which increasing hov lane kilometers would lead to reductions in carbon dioxide equivalent  co 2 e  and major air pollutants across the u s   by state  increasing hov lane extent has the greatest potential to reduce annual co 2 e in the district of columbia  followed by hawaii and new york  the smallest potential is found in states with the lowest population density  led by north dakota  we then explore the extent to which recommendations made at one level of data aggregation  that of individual states  may be valid for another level  such as individual counties  the only state with sufficient data available to disaggregate the model to the county level is california  where we found a lower potential for state wide co 2 e emission reductions under the county level model as compared to the state level model  0 69  as compared to 1 08   under the same hypothetical scenario   albeit with significant differences in emission reduction potential between counties with higher vs  lower population densities  this analysis demonstrates the potential to generate generalizable insight into the magnitude of vehicle emission reductions that might be achieved through expanding hov lanes  and highlights the importance of data disaggregation in identifying the optimal locations for potential reductions  
 quantifying the value of a clean ride  how far would you bicycle to avoid exposure to traffic related air pollution  while there is widespread acceptance of the health benefits of bicycling  recent research has highlighted that the benefits may be partially offset by the potential adverse health impacts as a result of bicyclists  exposure to traffic related air pollution  using a stated preference experiment  data from 695 commuter cyclists was compiled through a web based survey and analyzed using a random utility approach to evaluate whether and to what extent cyclists are willing to trade off air pollution exposure with other attributes such as roadway characteristics  bike facilities  and travel time  mean and maximum concentrations of nitrogen dioxide  in parts per billion or ppb   a common marker of traffic related air pollution  were used as the attributes to represent the externality  ranging from 5 to 60 ppb   empirical results indicate that travel time and traffic volume remain the most important attributes for commuter cyclists in their route decision  we also computed a unique marginal rate of substitution called  value of clean ride   vcr   for mean exposure  the vcr is  0 72 min ppb and for maximum exposure  the vcr is  0 25 min ppb  95  distribution   0 16  0 67   this essentially suggests that if an alternative route was available with an average nitrogen dioxide concentration that is lower by 5 ppb  a realistic goal in light of the high spatial variability in air pollution within urban areas   then cyclists would be willing to take it if it added no more than about 4 min to their travel time  we also observed that cyclists who received information on short term impacts of traffic related air pollution tended to be more concerned with avoiding maximum exposure  
 quantile analysis of factors influencing the time taken to clear road traffic incidents the time it takes to clear road traffic incidents is an important performance measure in highway management  understanding the effects of explanatory variables on incident clearance time is a necessary step in developing incident management strategies  previously  hazard based duration models have been used extensively in identifying the influential factors in incident duration  quantile regression models have been introduced in survival analysis  and these offer a more flexible approach to analyse incident duration data  the advantage offered by quantile regression lies in the ability to make inferences about the effect of explanatory variables on different quantiles of the incident duration distribution  in this work  quantile regression was applied to an incident clearance time dataset collected on freeway sections in seattle  usa  based on the estimation results from quantile regression  four influential factors were identified to have a stronger impact at the upper tail of the clearance time distribution  these factors cannot be identified through the conventional hazard based duration methods used in most previous studies  the findings of this study suggest that the additional information obtained from quantile regression about the short term and long term effects of explanatory variables is potentially useful for assigning clearance priority to different road traffic incident types

 quantitative analysis of the world sea piracy by fuzzy ahp and fuzzy topsis methodologies despite to many conventions and regulations in force against sea piracy  the problem still threatens the security of the world sea transportations by affecting both the ship and the crew on board  privateering and piracy  which are widely occurred  were analyzed within the context of the current study  the factors causing piracy incidents were first defined to propose practical and applicable solutions for the problem  the expert opinions on criteria set were analyzed by applying fuzzy ahp and fuzzy topsis techniques to determine the significance level and ranking the alternatives  among all criteria the  economic insufficiency  c6   was received the maximum score as the most effective cause of the sea piracy whereas the least effective factor was decided as  geographic location of the canals and straits that are in risky regions of the world  cl    while the most important alternative to offer a solution to this problem was established as  providing support local and regional authority in risky regions  a5    the least important alternative was confirmed as  providing rehabilitations to individuals or groups  which have tendency toward privateering actions  a6   
 questions of governance  rethinking the study of transportation policy this paper critiques the state of the art approaches to studying transportation policy  it does so through analysing 100 papers sampled from the two leading policy journals in the transportation literature  on applying two different frameworks for understanding policy  the review finds that only 13  of papers consider specific aspects of the policy cycle  that 60  focus on  tools  for policy  and that two thirds of papers did not engage with real world policy examples or policy makers and focussed on quantitative analysis alone  we argue that these findings highlight the persistence of the technical rational model within the transportation literature  this model  and the numerous traditions and disciplines that have fed into it have an important role to play in developing the transportation evidence base  however  we argue there are important questions of governance  such as context  power  resources and legitimacy  that are largely being ignored in the literature as it stands  the substantial lack of engagement with governance issues and debates means that as a field we are artificially  but more importantly  disproportionately generating a science of applied policy making which is unlikely to be utilised because of the distance between it and the realities on the ground  the paper identifies analytical approaches deployed readily in other fields that could be used to address some of the key deficiencies   c  2017 elsevier ltd  all rights reserved  
 queues with server vacations as a model for pretimed signalized urban traffic a queuing system resulting from a signalized intersection regulated by pretimed control in a network of urban traffic is considered  modeling the queue length and the delay of vehicles is crucial to evaluate the performance of intersections equipped with traffic signals  air quality and rational use of energy also depend on an efficient management of the intersections  these traffic systems have the specificity that the server  green signal  is deactivated  red signal  during a fixed period of time  in the present work  an m d 1 queue with a server that occasionally takes vacations is analyzed  the mean delays of vehicles and the mean queue length are computed and compared with those obtained by using a detailed simulation model in a case study  we find that  in general  the mean delays of vehicles given by the proposed queuing model provide a good approximation  but the model can provide slightly smaller values than those obtained in the simulation model for large traffic flows  this result is of interest for traffic engineers  as the approaches one can find in the literature for large signalized urban traffic flows are subject to criticism  
 rail worker fatigue  identification  management and countermeasures on a 24 7 railway  managing the risks of operator fatigue is crucial for maintaining the reliability and safety of the system  whilst there is a substantial body of scientific literature covering the causes and effects of fatigue  a recent accident investigation report exposed gaps in our applied knowledge regarding barriers to reporting fatigue  and the problems of monitoring and mitigating the risk arising from fatigue  this paper responds to that call by reviewing literature and practices regarding fatigue management in rail and other safety critical industries  before focusing on potential solutions for assessing  monitoring and counteracting fatigue both before and during a shift  the authors conclude by identifying areas for future work in this field  
 rail transit induced gentrification and the affordability paradox of tod numerous studies have shown that rail transit has a positive effect on raising property values and tax revenues  such an effect is widely viewed as an economic benefit for property owners and is key to justifying the high cost of building rail transit infrastructure  in recent years  however  concerns have been raised about rail transit acting as a gentrification trigger and causing the affordability paradox  in this study  i evaluate whether rail transit in suburban portland caused neighborhood gentrification and reduced home affordability through a longitudinal quasi experimental design  i use the propensity score matching method to identify control neighborhoods for rail transit served neighborhoods  i then make pretest posttest comparisons between rail transit served neighborhoods and their control neighborhoods at multiple observation points  in general  i did not find consistent evidence for rail transit induced gentrification in suburban portland  i did not find evidence that rail transit reduced home affordability for tenants and home owners in rail transit served neighborhoods either  i observed more changes in the neighborhoods served by the eastside line  the oldest rail transit line in portland  than their control neighborhoods in the past three decades  socially  they attracted older and less educated population  physically  they experienced densification and faster increases of the share of rental units in their housing stock  rail transit was more likely to be installed along low income neighborhoods in suburban portland  confirming the necessity of constructing appropriate control neighborhoods while evaluating the neighborhood and social effects of rail transit  
 raising the speed limit from 75 to 80 mph on utah rural interstates  effects on vehicle speeds and speed variance introduction  in november 2010 and october 2013  utah increased speed limits on sections of rural interstates from 75 to 80 mph  effects on vehicle speeds and speed variance were examined  methods  speeds were measured in may 2010 and may 2014 within the new 80 mph zones  and at a nearby spillover site and at more distant control sites where speed limits remained 75 mph  log linear regression models estimated percentage changes in speed variance and mean speeds for passenger vehicles and large trucks associated with the speed limit increase  logistic regression models estimated effects on the probability of passenger vehicles exceeding 80  85  or 90 mph and large trucks exceeding 80 mph  results  within the 80 mph zones and at the spillover location in 2014  mean passenger vehicle speeds were significantly higher  4 1  and 3 5   respectively   as were the probabilities that passenger vehicles exceeded 80 mph  122 3  and 88 5   respectively   than would have been expected without the speed limit increase  probabilities that passenger vehicles exceeded 85 and 90 mph were non significantly higher than expected within the 80 mph zones  for large trucks  the mean speed and probability of exceeding 80 mph were higher than expected within the 80 mph zones  only the increase in mean speed was significant  raising the speed limit was associated with non significant increases in speed variance  conclusions  the study adds to the wealth of evidence that increasing speed limits leads to higher travel speeds and an increased probability of exceeding the new speed limit  results moreover contradict the claim that increasing speed limits reduces speed variance  practical applications  although the estimated increases in mean vehicle speeds may appear modest  prior research suggests such increases would be associated with substantial increases in fatal or injury crashes  this should be considered by lawmakers considering increasing speed limits   c  2017 national safety council and elsevier ltd  all rights reserved

 rational behavior adjustment process with boundedly rational user equilibrium this paper extends the framework of  rational behavior adjustment process   rbap  to incorporating the  boundedly rational user equilibrium   brue   the proportional switch adjustment process  psap  and the network tatonnement process  ntp  are extended to the brue case  and their dynamical equations are shown to be lipschitz continuous  which guarantees the global uniqueness of the classical solutions  a special group of the brue rbap is proposed  for which the path flows would increase if the paths are in an acceptable path set  and would decrease otherwise  classical solutions to this special group of models may not exist  stability of the brue rbap with classical solutions is proved with separable link travel cost functions  for nonseparable link travel cost functions  the stability of the brue psap is proved  numerical examples are presented to demonstrate the evolution processes of brue psap and brue ntp under various bounded rationality thresholds and different initial states  the applicability of brue psap in larger networks with asymmetric link travel cost functions is also illustrated  
 rationality of fare increment for improvement of transfer facilities at metro stations  an experience in kolkata there are several lacunas associated with the public transport quality and allied facilities in emerging countries such as india  the improvement of these facilities is a major challenge as most of the governments are not only finding it difficult to provide an additional subsidy for the improvement but are also hesitant to increase the fare because of socio political reasons  in this context  the present paper demonstrates an approach for investigating the rationality of fare increment with reference to a case study of transfer facilities at metro stations in kolkata city  india  rationality of the fare increment is judged by comparing the fare increment with  i  benefits likely to be transferred to commuters due to improvement   ii  present fare  and  iii  average daily income of metro commuters  the work also highlights the need for quantifying the benefits likely to be transferred to commuters from the proposed improvements for relating the fare increment to derived benefits  it is shown that if the fare increment is found rational then facilities should be developed by recovering the associated cost from commuters without putting the additional financial burden on the government  the government subsidy should be introduced only when it is required to bring down the fare increment to a level which is considered rational  the findings will hopefully encourage policy makers to apply the approach to other contexts for improvement of transport facility or quality of service with a rational increment of fare and use of government subsidy  as and when required  
 reading cyclist intentions  can a lead cyclist s behaviour be predicted  as a cyclist  it is essential to make inferences about the intentions of other road users in order to anticipate their behaviour  there are official ways for cyclists to communicate their intentions to other road users  such as using their arms to point in the intended direction of travel  however  in everyday traffic cyclists often do not use such active forms of communication  therefore  other visual cues have to be used to anticipate  critical  encounters or events  during this study  108 participants completed a video internet survey in which they predicted the intentions of a lead cyclist based on visible behaviour preceding a turning manoeuvre  when the lead cyclist approached the intersection  each video was stopped just before the cyclist initiated turning  based on visual cues  the participants had to select which direction they thought the cyclist would go  after entering their prediction  they were asked how certain they were about their prediction and on which visible behaviour s  each prediction was based  the results show that it is very hard to predict the direction of a turning cyclist based on visual cues before the turning manoeuvre is initiated  exploratory regression analyses revealed that observable behaviours such as head movements and cycling speed were related to prediction accuracy  these results may be used to support cyclists in traffic interactions   c  2016 elsevier ltd  all rights reserved  
 real options and flexibility analysis in design and management of one way mobility on demand systems using decision rules this study explores the concepts of real options and flexibility analysis as an approach to address uncertain demand growth in mobility on demand  mod  vehicle sharing systems  with the goal of improving expected lifecycle performance  as mod systems are gaining popularity worldwide  they inevitably face significant uncertainty in terms of needs and customer demands  designing  planning capacity deployment  and operating such system can be challenging  and require significant capital investments for companies and cities  two distinct real options analysis  roa  models are developed to evaluate and optimize flexible strategies for these systems  relying on a novel methodological approach to value flexibility based on decision rules  the decision rule based approach differs from standard roa approaches used to quantify the value of flexibility in irreversible investment projects  typically based on dynamic programming  it emulates the decision making process by capturing mathematically a triggering mechanism that determines when it is best to exercise the flexibilities embedded in the system design  two prevalent types of mod systems are studied in this paper as demonstration of the methodological framework  a station based system where customers must pick up and return the vehicle at specific locations  and a free floating system  where customers may pick up and drop the car anywhere within a certain area  a simulation based approach is used to analyze the station based system  which models the rebalancing operations from a micro level perspective  the approach consists of a discrete event simulator for performance estimation  and an optimization algorithm for design space exploration that integrates a population based search algorithm with optimal computing budget allocation  ocba   for the free floating system  an analytical model is developed where the decision rule is formulated into and solved using stochastic mixed integer programming  mip   the study provides guidance to system operators on potential strategies for deploying mod systems  considering explicitly uncertainty and flexibility as a value enhancing mechanism   c  2017 elsevier ltd  all rights reserved  
 real time automatic rescheduling strategy for an urban rail line by integrating the information of fault handling in the operation of urban rails  faults are inevitable  which leads to deviation between the actual timetable and the planned timetable  in nowadays  timetable rescheduling strategies rarely integrate the information of fault handling  in this paper  we develop a real time automatic rescheduling strategy  which integrates the dynamic information of fault handling  the rescheduled timetable is obtained by a mathematical optimization model  the constraints set of which is automatically generated and adjusted as more information of fault handling is feedback  compared with the experience based rescheduling methods  the automatic rescheduling strategy reacts more quickly  and uses the information of fault handling more efficiently  a simulation system for testing the automatic rescheduling strategy is built  which uses the data of the beijing yizhuang metro line  via testing on the simulation system  the effectiveness and efficiency of the automatic rescheduling strategy are validated   c  2017 elsevier ltd  all rights reserved

 reducing the air quality and co2 climate impacts of taxi and takeoff operations at airports aircraft activity at airports is a source of co2 emissions that affect the climate and other pollutants that affect air quality and human health  we estimate the air quality and climate benefits of two measures applied to aircraft operations at the detroit metropolitan airport   pushback control and de rated takeoffs  we also calculate the minimum air quality and environmental impacts beyond fuel burn and co2 minimization by optimizing gate holding and takeoff thrust hourly over the year  pushback control  i e  holding aircraft at their gates up to 25 min to reduce congestion  minimizes fuel burn and reduces emissions and air quality impacts from taxi operations by 35 38  relative to no gate holds  the pm2 5 and 03 costs can be further reduced beyond fuel burn minimization by 2 7  and 8 5   respectively  by optimizing the gate holds according to time varying atmospheric conditions  de rated takeoffs  i e  takeoffs at 75  thrust  reduce pm2 5 costs from takeoff operations by 18   up to 21 6  when optimized  relative to full thrust takeoffs  but result in 3  increased fuel burn and co2 climate impacts  the environmental costs of takeoff operations are minimized with an average thrust setting of 81   while total fuel combustion related costs  i e  the sum of environmental  fuel and maintenance costs  are minimized with 75  thrust  our findings suggest that the pushback control strategy is effective in mitigating the environmental impacts of taxi operations at airports  and that de rated takeoffs are effective in reducing the environmental costs of takeoff operations at an optimal level of de rate   c  2017 elsevier ltd  all rights reserved  
 reducing the threat of wildlife vehicle collisions during peak tourism periods using a roadside animal detection system roadside animal detection systems  rads  aim to reduce the frequency of wildlife vehicle collisions  unlike fencing and wildlife passages  rads do not attempt to keep animals off the road  rather  they attempt to modify driver behavior by detecting animals near the road and warning drivers with flashing signs  a rads was installed in big cypress national park  florida  usa  in 2012 in response to an increased number of florida panther mortalities  to assess driver response  we measured the speed of individual cars on the road when the rads was active  flashing  and inactive  not flashing  during the tourist season  november march  and the off season  april october   which vary dramatically in traffic volume  we also used track beds and camera traps to assess whether roadside activity of large mammal species varied between seasons  in the tourist season  the activation of the rads caused a significant reduction in vehicle speed  however  this effect was not observed in the off season  track and camera data showed that the tourist season coincided with peak periods of activity for several large mammals of conservation interest  drivers in the tourist season generally drove faster than those in the off season  so a reduction in speed in response to the rads is more beneficial in the tourist season  because traffic volume and roadside activity of several species of conservation interest both peak during the tourist season  our study indicates that the rads has the potential to reduce the number of accidents during this period of heightened risk  
 reducing the uncertainty induced by spatial aggregation in accessibility and spatial interaction applications analyses of spatial interaction are to some degree plagued by uncertainty regarding the impact of spatially dispersed interaction masses within zones on travel times  in this paper  interaction weighted travel times are computed from a matrix between regularly distributed points at fine resolution  and used together with secondary data to improve estimates of interaction weighted travel time based on commonly applied methods  the paper proposes a method for computing intra zonal  interaction weighted travel times that is considerably less sensitive to spatial aggregation than existing approaches  and demonstrates that population weighted centroids are to be preferred over geographically weighted centroids  
 reformulations by discretization for piecewise linear integer multicommodity network flow problems we consider the piecewise linear multicommodity network flow problem with the addition of a constraint specifying that the total flow on each arc must be an integer  this problem has applications in transportation and logistics  where total flows might represent vehicles or containers filled with different products  we introduce formulations that exploit this integrality constraint by adapting to our problem a technique known as discretization that has been used to derive mixed integer programming models for several combinatorial optimization problems  we enhance the discretized models either by adding valid inequalities derived from cut set inequalities or by using flow disaggregation techniques  since the size of the formulations derived from discretization and flow disaggregation rapidly increases with problem dimensions  we develop an efficient and effective lagrangian relaxation method to compute lower and upper bounds  we perform computational results on a large set of randomly generated instances that allow us to compare the relative efficiency of the different modeling alternatives  flow disaggregation plus addition of cut set inequalities with or without discretization   when used within the lagrangian relaxation approach  
 regional differences in the determinants of oregon vmt road user charges  rucs  in the form of per mile charges have been suggested as an alternative to fuel taxes to help keep up with the costs of maintaining and expanding public road systems  the success of a ruc in providing for the long term stability of highway finance depends partly on how drivers respond to changes in the tax structure and also other determinants of driving behavior  region specific characteristics  such as public transit accessibility and biking infrastructure  may also affect vehicle miles traveled  vmt  demand  this paper uses econometric techniques to examine the determinants of vmt using data from the oregon household activities survey  ohas   we use standard ols regression to examine the impact of urban density  household income  fuel cost  transit mileage  household location  and additional household characteristics on vmt  preliminary results show that statewide oregon demand for vmt is positively and significantly impacted by household income  statewide  fuel price  transit use and population density are all found to be statistically significant and negatively related to household vmt  however  at the regional level some of these variables lose significance  holding all factors constant  household vmt is found to differ by region as well as by population density   c  2017 elsevier ltd  all rights reserved

 representation requirements for perfect first in first out verification in continuous flow dynamic models dynamic models of traffic require answers for many issues  one of them is the way priorities of different traffic streams  commodities  are managed  this is particularly challenging when flows are treated as continuous  it is common to consider the first in first out  fifo  rule as a baseline for setting priorities  but most practical continuous flow dynamic models do not satisfy fifo perfectly  this paper examines the difficulties associated with full adherence to network wide fifo  we examine six different ways to represent dynamic flow solutions over a network  and for each representation we discuss whether it is sufficient for verifying fifo  whether the verification process is finite  and whether proving fifo can be directly implied  throughout the evaluation eight alternative definitions of fifo are considered  seven of them are shown to be essentially equivalent  while the last definition is not  and may therefore be considered as  weak  fifo  the most promising representation appears to be the one denoted as  cohort bundles  while somewhat more abstract than the other representations  supporting this representation directly shows perfect fifo satisfaction  further evaluation of this representation remains a subject for future research  in a nutshell  the key conclusion of this analysis is that in order to satisfy perfect network wide fifo the number of discretized elements of flow should probably be allowed to grow quickly and unboundedly with model duration  and it cannot be determined a priori  these insights about the challenges of incorporating fifo in continuous flow dynamic models  which may be relevant also for other behavior based priority rules  can help modelers and practitioners set realistic expectations regarding the level of control over priority rules that can be achieved within finite  dimensional continuous flow dynamic models   c  2017 elsevier ltd  all rights reserved  
 rescheduling through stop skipping in dense railway systems based on the analysis of the railway system in the paris region in france  this paper presents a rescheduling problem in which stops on train lines can be skipped and services are retimed to recover when limited disturbances occur  indeed  in such mass transit systems  minor disturbances tend to propagate and generate larger delays through the shared use of resources  if no action is quickly taken  an integrated integer linear programming model is presented whose objective function minimizes both the recovery time and the waiting time of passengers  additional criteria related to the weighted number of train stops that are skipped are included in the objective function  rolling stock constraints are also taken into account to propose a feasible plan  computational experiments on real data are conducted to show the impact of rescheduling decisions depending on key parameters such as the duration of the disturbances and the minimal turning time between trains  the trade off between the different criteria in the objective function is also illustrated and discussed   c  2017 elsevier ltd  all rights reserved

 residential segregation and commuting patterns of migrant workers in china in china  many rural migrant workers experience residential segregation and live in urbanizing villages  due to china s unique institutional context  e g  land tenure system  hukou system  as well as exclusionary housing regulations  the purpose of this paper is to investigate whether these urbanizing villages provide good job accessibility for rural migrant workers  we explore this problem by investigating the commuting patterns of migrant workers  through a survey conducted in 2009 across four mega regions in china that are currently experiencing rapid urbanization  we collected individual level information on rural migrant workers  commute distances and durations  demographics  household socioeconomic status  and whether the migrant worker is living in an urbanizing village or not  from residential address information collected in the survey  we constructed a group of built environment variables  using iv tobit models to address the endogeneity issues associated with residential location choice  our analyses show that these urbanizing villages actually provide relatively good accessibility to job opportunities  this result is different from what is suggested by the spatial mismatch literature based on u s  data  this research helps to fill the gap in the literature on the relationship between residential segregation  built environment and travel behavior in the chinese context  the findings have implications for policymaking  especially when many government officials are proposing to demolish urbanizing villages without fully realizing the benefits of these villages  this research could also provide useful information for other developing countries facing residential segregation of migrants or immigrants   c  2016 elsevier ltd  all rights reserved  
 resilient facility location against the risk of disruptions in this paper  we consider an uncapacitated facility location problem  rufl  with random facility disruptions  we develop risk averse optimization formulations to compute resilient location and customer assignment solutions for two cases  i e   under either independent or correlated disruptions   where the risks are expressed through a family of risk measures including conditional value at risk  cvar  and absolute semideviation  asd   the risk averse rufl with independent facility disruptions is to control the risks at each individual customer and modeled as a mixed integer nonlinear programming  which is challenging to be solved  in response  we develop a branch and cut algorithm combined with augmented lagrangian decomposition for globally optimizing the problem  as for the risk averse rufl with correlated facility disruptions  we propose a scenario based model to minimize the total fixed costs and risks across the entire customer set  the resulting formulation is a pure milp and a lagrangian decomposition scheme is proposed for computational aspects in large scale cases  our numerical results show that the risk averse models outperform the classic risk neutral models in improving the reliability  experiments demonstrate that our proposed algorithms perform well  to conclude  we extract managerial insights that suggest important guidelines for controlling risk in the face of disruption   c  2017 elsevier ltd  all rights reserved  
 response of electric vehicle drivers to dynamic pricing of parking and charging services  risky choice in early reservations when clusters of electric vehicles charge simultaneously in urban areas  the capacity of the power network might not be adequate to accommodate the additional electricity demand  recent studies suggest that real time control strategies  like dynamic pricing of electricity  can spread the demand and help operators to avoid costly infrastructure investments  to assess the effectiveness of dynamic pricing  it is necessary to understand how electric vehicle drivers respond to uncertain future prices when they charge their vehicle away from home  even when data is available from electric vehicle trials  the lack of variability in electricity prices renders them insufficient for this analysis  we resolve this problem by designing a survey where we observe the stated preferences of the respondents for hypothetical charging services  a novel feature of this survey is its interface  which resembles an online or smartphone application for parking and charging reservations  the time of booking choices are evaluated within a risky choice modelling framework  where expected utility and non  expected utility specifications are compared to understand how people perceive price probabilities  in the progress  we bring together theoretical frameworks of forward looking behaviour in contexts where individuals were subject to equivalent price uncertainties  the results suggest that  a  the majority of the electric vehicle drivers are risk averse by choosing a certain price to an uncertain one and  b  there is a non linearity in their choices  with a disproportional influence by the upper end of the price distribution  this approach gives new perspectives in the way people plan their travel activities in advance and highlights the impact of uncertainty when managing limited resources in dense urban centres  similar surveys and analyses could provide valuable insights in a wide range of innovative mobility applications  including car sharing  ride sharing and on demand services   c  2017 the author s   published by elsevier ltd  
 rethinking business as usual  mackenzie river freight transport in the context of climate change impacts in northern canada the mackenzie river is a major transportation route serving many remote northern canadian communities and mining sites  the river is only navigable during the summer and early fall  when clear of ice  however  the river s water conditions have changed significantly in recent years  and are expected to continue to do so  resulting in increased uncertainty for waterway transport  this paper presents a model for providing guidance to shipping companies  customers  and government on how shipping patterns may need to evolve to effectively adapt to changing climate conditions  future freight volumes are forecasted using time series analysis  then  logistics cost optimization is used to incorporate predicted water flow profile changes in shipping companies  future delivery schedule planning  results indicate that future waterway freight delivery capacities in september and october may be insufficient to transport forecasted volumes  and shipping companies may be advised to arrange for increased delivery activities in june and july  if delivery capacities are constrained by equipment and crew availability rather than water conditions in the first half of the shipping season  shipping companies may also need to take advantage of earlier anticipated ice breakup to begin the delivery season earlier  incorporating this method for climate change adaptation in freight schedule planning may aid both shipping companies and government agencies in rethinking current practices  the method is particularly suitable for a region where harsh environmental conditions  climate change  and extreme remoteness have an overwhelming impact on operations  and logistical delays are considered quite differently from supply chains further south   c  2017 elsevier ltd  all rights reserved  
 revealing intra urban travel patterns and service ranges from taxi trajectories as an important transport tool  taxi plays a significant role to meet travel demand in urban city  understanding the travel patterns of taxis is important for addressing many urban sustainability challenges  previous research has primarily focused on examining the statistical properties of taxi trips to characterize travel patterns  while it may be more appropriate to explore taxi service strategies on seasonal  weekly or daily time scale  therefore  intra urban taxi mobility is investigated by examining taxi trajectory data that were collected in harbin  china  while 12 week corresponding to 12 month is chosen as the sampling period in our study  the multivariate spatial point pattern analysis is firstly adopted to characterize and model the spatial dependence  and infer significant positive spatial relationships between the picked up points  pups  and the dropped off points  dops   secondly  the points of interest  pois  are identified from dops using the emerging hot spot detection technique  then the taxi services and movement patterns surrounding pois are further examined in details  moreover  our study builds on and extends the existing work to examine the statistical regularities of trip distances  and we also validate and quantify the impacts posed by airport trips on the distance distributions  finally  the movement based kernel density estimation  mkde  method is proposed to estimate taxis  service ranges within three isopleth levels  50  75 and 95   between summer weekday and winter weekend from taxi driver s perspective  and season as well as temperature factors are identified as the significant effect within certain service range levels  these results are expected to enhance current urban mobility research and suggest some interesting avenues for future research  
 reverse and closed loop supply chain coordination by government role due to the increasing number of end of life  eol  products and their related environmental concerns  much attention has been paid to reverse logistics  in this paper  we consider a two echelon reverse supply chain  rsc  with one manufacturer and one retailer who try to improve sustainable consumption by increasing customers  willingness to return used products through offering a discount or a direct fee in exchange for bringing back eol products  afterward  the model is extended to consider a closed loop supply chain  clsc   quantity discounts and increasing fee contracts are proposed to coordinate supply chains  then  government role in improving coordinated supply chains through donating different incentives  tax exemption and subsidy  to supply chain members are analyzed  results show that total channel profit in the coordinated case is improved  also  in the proposed models  each member has enough motives to participate in the plan  in addition  results demonstrate that government sponsored incentives to the manufacturer are preferred to the retailer   c  2017 elsevier ltd  all rights reserved

 risk profiles in novice road users  relation between moped riding simulator performance  on road aberrant behaviors and dangerous driving the aim of this study was to compare the scores obtained by an italian sample of novice drivers riders on an adapted version of the driver behaviour questionnaire  dbq  and the dula dangerous driving index  dddi  with their performance in a moped riding simulator  cluster analysis on the indexes extracted by the simulator were used to identify two groups with opposite riding styles  prudent riders and imprudent riders  using the dbq our data not only confirmed data in the literature indicating that females reported more driving errors than males  and that males reported higher intended violation scores than females  but also showed that gender effects are modulated by riding style  as measured by the simulator  and driving exposure  differences between males  and females  dbq scores were only apparent for imprudent riders  while  the reported errors  slips and lapses  and violations were lower the higher the driving exposure  as for the dddi  males scored higher than females for risky driving  and the aggressive driving scores were higher the greater the driving exposure  but only for imprudent riders  these results provide crucial information for the use of dbq and dddi questionnaires in the italian population  they also confirm that a multidimensional approach  supported by the use of driving simulators  may facilitate a more detailed assessment of riding abilities   c  2017 elsevier ltd  all rights reserved  
 risky weighting in discrete choice this paper presents a new approach to discrete choice analysis for risky prospects  conventional discrete choice analysis focuses on riskless prospects and does not deal with the scenario where the alternatives that the decision makers choose from are associated with risk  in this paper  we investigate decision makers  risk perception and choice behaviour in choice experiments when they are facing several risky prospects  we propose a broad class of cumulative risky weighting functions  upon which a unified cumulative risky weighting function is developed  we show that this unified cumulative risky weighting function includes several existing cumulative risky weighting functions  as special cases  we then develop a multivariate method for choice analysis with risky prospects to account for decision makers  individual specific risk perception and the impact of various factors on the value function respectively  we illustrate the developed method using an empirical study on road tolling in australia   c  2017 elsevier ltd  all rights reserved  
 road freight transport policies and their impact  a comparative study of germany and sweden by comparing two representative countries  sweden and germany  we study the impacts of different road freight transport policies  sweden applies a time based infrastructure charge  and has done so since the 1990ies  germany has introduced distance based charges and subsidized the purchase of low emission trucks  we find that the german road freight policy has resulted in substantially larger revenues and a cleaner truck fleet and mileage  some support is found for that the german policy causes spill overs to the neighbouring countries as hauliers tend to use the cleanest trucks in countries with distance based tolls  by comparing the actual composition of trucks using the swedish network to a hypothetical case where the composition is the same as on the german toll roads  we estimate the environmental costs to be around  sic 39 million less per year in the latter case  this puts pressure on countries as sweden to implement stronger policies  
 road safety and the urban emergency medical service  uems   strategy station location this paper provides a methodology on how to contribute to road safety by improving the vehicle response of urban emergency medical services  uems  using road safety investments  the methodology embodies two steps  the first step includes a demand assessment through a model that calculates the frequency of urban emergency events and their priority in a spatial area per different population demographics and urban characteristics  these events are categorized by type  which we separated as road crashes  cardiac arrests and other emergency events that require the dispatch of an ambulance with a medical team  the second step proposes an optimization model developed to maximize the uems vehicle coverage  considering road crashes by locating ambulance stations in the urban area  giving priority to high priority emergencies and strategically double covering road crashes  the applicability and practical interest of the proposed models are proven by applying them to the real world case of the metropolitan area of porto  where data on the emergency service response  land use and population demographics are available  the final conclusions indicate that areas prone to high volumes of traffic and high speed roads lead to higher volumes of road crash emergencies  and stations should be located closer to high speed roads  moreover  further investigations should entail micromanagement improvements to assist in road crashes  
 road safety determinants  do political institutions matter  road safety is a global health problem and its severity in developing countries highlights the need for research to address its causes  we explore the effect of institutional variables on road safety  redressing the literature s failure to consider political institutions as road safety determinants  specifically  we analyze the effect on traffic accidents and fatalities of different political regimes  electoral rules and forms of government  by drawing on an international sample of countries taken over a long time span  we implement panel data methods to empirically estimate the role of institutions on road safety determinants  we find that democratic institutions are associated with better road safety outcomes  the beneficial effects of democratization become apparent after about four years in countries undergoing a regime transition and are also discernible in established democracies that are consolidating their political institutions  finally  our results suggest that road safety can be characterized as a local public good and that its provision is greater in parliamentary systems  this paper is the first empirical paper shedding light on the role of institutions to road safety outcomes  our results provide evidence of how the democratization of countries involve positive externalities to road safety outcomes

 road traffic crash risk associated with prescription of hydroxyzine and other sedating h1 antihistamines  a responsibility and case crossover study background h1 antihistamines differ from each other by their ability to cross the blood brain barrier  the resulting sedating effect can be sought in therapy but may be a driving hazard  the aim of this study was to estimate the impact of sedating h1 antihistamines on the risk of road traffic crash  with a particular focus on hydroxyzine which is also indicated as an anxiolytic in france  methods  the study consisted in extracting and matching data from three french nationwide databases  the national healthcare insurance database  police reports and the police national database of injurious crashes  all sedating h1 antihistamines  including hydroxyzine  were considered in the study  a case control analysis  in which responsible drivers were cases and non responsible were controls was performed  a case crossover analysis  comparing for the same subject exposure during a period immediately before the crash with exposure during an earlier period  was also conducted  results  the extraction and matching procedures over the july 2005 december 2011 period led to the inclusion of 142 771 drivers involved in an injurious road traffic crash  the responsibility study found an increased risk of being responsible for an injurious road traffic crash in hydroxyzine users who were registered with a long term chronic disease  mostly psychiatric disorders  on the day of the crash  or   1 67  1 22 2 30    among them  the risk was even higher in drivers with highest exposure levels  or   2 60  1 23 5 50    there was no impact of sedating h1 antihistamine treatment initiation on the risk of crash  conclusion  even if it is difficult to disentangle the part of the increased risk that would be causally related to hydroxyzine and the part related to behaviours of patients with a heavy psychiatric disorder  our study raises the alarm on the crash risk linked to hydroxyzine utilization in countries in which the anxiolytic indication is widespread  
 road transport and co2 emissions  what are the challenges  in order for the world to stay within the safety threshold of a 2 degrees c increase in average temperature agreed by virtually all governments  the transport sector needs to be decarbonized  the two main obstacles that have prevented this from happening have been the absence of a global legally binding deal and the high relative cost of clean vehicle energy technologies  the paris agreement  which commits countries to reductions of ghg emissions  has virtually solved the first problem and paved the way for countries to implement environmental taxes and subsidies in order to change the relative costs of clean alternatives  which would solve the second problem  these policy actions combined with investment in clean infrastructure and regulation can decarbonize the transport sector  
 roadside vegetation design characteristics that can improve local  near road air quality as public health concerns have increased due to the rising number of studies linking adverse health effects with exposures to traffic related air pollution near large roadways  interest in methods to mitigate these exposures have also increased  several studies have investigated the use of roadside features in reducing near road air pollution concentrations since this method is often one of the few short term options available  since roadside vegetation has other potential benefits  the impact of this feature has been of particular interest  the literature has been mixed on whether roadside vegetation reduces nearby pollutant concentrations  or whether this feature has no effect or even potentially increases downwind air pollutant concentrations  however  these differences in study results highlight key characteristics of the vegetative barrier that can result in pollutant reductions or increase local pollutant levels  this paper describes the characteristics of roadside vegetation that previous research shows can result in improved local air quality  as well as identify characteristics that should be avoided in order to protect from unintended increases in nearby concentrations  these design conditions include height  thickness  coverage  porosity density  and species characteristics that promote improved air quality  these design considerations can inform highway departments  urban and transportation planners  and developers in understanding how best to preserve existing roadside vegetation or plant vegetative barriers in order to reduce air pollution impacts near transportation facilities  these designs can also be used to mitigate impacts from other air pollution sources where emissions occur near ground level  published by elsevier ltd

 robust optimization of distance based tolls in a network considering stochastic day to day dynamics this paper investigates the nonlinear distance based congestion pricing in a network considering stochastic day to day dynamics  after an implementation adjustment of a congestion pricing scheme  the network flows in a certain period of days are not on an equilibrium state  thus it is problematic to take the equilibrium based indexes as the pricing objective  therefore  the concept of robust optimization is taken for the congestion toll determination problem  which takes into account the network performance of each day  first  a minimax model which minimizes the maximum regret on each day is proposed  taking as a constraint of the minimax model  a path based day to day dynamics model under stochastic user equilibrium  sue  constraints is discussed in this paper  it is difficult to solve this minimax model by exact algorithms because of the implicity of the flow map function  hence  a two phase artificial bee colony algorithm is developed to solve the proposed minimax regret model  of which the first phase solves the minimal expected total travel cost for each day and the second phase handles the minimax robust optimization problem  finally  a numerical example is conducted to validate the proposed models and methods   c  2017 elsevier ltd  all rights reserved  
 robust routing and timetabling in complex railway stations in nearly saturated station areas the limited capacity is one of the main reasons of delay propagation  spreading the trains well in time and space in these areas has a big impact on the passenger robustness  i e  the total travel time in practice of all passengers in the railway network in case of frequently occurring small delays  we focus on improving the performance in the bottleneck of the network in order to improve the performance of the whole railway network  this paper proposes a method that builds from scratch a routing plan and a cyclic timetable that optimizes the infrastructure occupation and the passenger robustness  an integer linear routing model assigns  without considering a timetable  every train to a route such that the maximal node usage is minimized and that the number of times that each node is used  is quadratically penalized  thereafter  a mixed integer linear timetabling model assigns to each train the blocking times at which the nodes on its route  assigned by the routing model  are reserved and released  different from other approaches is that we focus on the occupation of the railway infrastructure before constructing the timetable  the approach is validated on the complex railway station area of brussels  belgium   our routing plan and timetable from scratch improve the passenger robustness up to 11  compared to a reference timetable and routing plan composed by the belgian railway infrastructure manager infrabel and by up to 2  compared to a reference timetable and routing plan from literature   c  2017 elsevier ltd  all rights reserved

 role of sensation seeking and attitudes as mediators between age of driver and risky driving of powered two wheelers introduction  this study examines the effect of age of driver on risky driving of powered two wheelers  ptw  employing sensation seeking and safety attitudes as mediators  methods  a survey was conducted with 1299 ptw drivers  1089 males and 210 females  within the age of 18 and 63 years  living in the state of kerala  india  the questionnaire consisted of 31 items to measure sensation seeking  safety attitude  and risky driving of the drivers  results  mediation models were examined using sensation seeking as mediator and secondly safety attitudes as mediators  the relationship between the driver s age and risky driving was fully mediated by all the three variables  practical applications  results of this study suggest that safety strategies should be employed to reduce risky driving tendencies that could be achieved by shaping or adapting the mediators  reducing sensation seeking and enhancing safety attitudes   this goal could be reached by starting to educate children about this at an early stage when they are at school as well as by social learning and safety awareness campaigns   c  2017 national safety council and elsevier ltd  all rights reserved  
 rolling stock rescheduling in passenger railway transportation using dead heading trips and adjusted passenger demand in this paper we introduce dead heading trips and adjusted passenger demand in the rolling stock rescheduling problem  rsrp   unfortunately  disruptions disturb passenger railway transportation on a daily basis  such a disruption causes infeasibilities in the timetable  rolling stock circulation  and crew schedule  we propose a mixed integer linear programming model to tackle the rsrp  this formulation includes the possibility of using dead heading trips  moving empty trains  during  and after  a disruption  furthermore  passenger flows are included to handle the adjusted passenger demand after the occurrence of a disruption  many rolling stock rescheduling models are unable to cope with changing passenger demand  in this paper we include passenger demand on a more accurate level in the rsrp  we have tested the model on different cases from netherlands railways  the results show that dead heading trips are useful to reduce the number of cancelled trips and that adjusted passenger demand has a large influence on the rescheduled circulation   c  2017 elsevier ltd  all rights reserved  
 route choice stickiness of public transport passengers  measuring habitual bus ridership behaviour using smart card data this paper explores how we can use smart card data for bus passengers to reveal individual and aggregate travel behaviour  more specifically  we measure the extent to which both individual and bus routes exhibit habitual behaviour  to achieve this  we introduce a metric called stickiness index to quantify the range of preferences of users that always select to travel on the same route  high stickiness  to those with a more varied patterns of route selection  low stickiness   adopting a visual analytic and modelling approach using a suite of regression models we find evidence to suggest that stickiness varies across the metropolitan area and over a 24 h period wherein higher stickiness is associated with high frequency users where there is substantial variability of route travel times across all alternatives  we argue that our findings are important in their capacity to contribute to a new evidence base with the potential to inform the  re  design and scheduling of a public transit systems through unveiling the complexities of transit behaviour   c  2017 elsevier ltd  all rights reserved  
 rural migrant workers  intentions to permanently reside in cities and future energy consumption preference in the changing context of urban china focusing on china  which has a special household registration system  called hukou   this study examines the likely effects of the china s national new type urbanization plan  2014 2020  on rural migrant workers  intentions to reside permanently in cities and their future energy consumption preference  questionnaire surveys were conducted in 2014 and 2015 among rural migrant workers and residents with a hukou in three cities  985 migrants and 671 residents with a hukou   analysis results show that 39  of migrant workers intended to reside permanently in cities under the aforementioned plan  and the current energy consumption of residents with a hukou is 1 2 4 0 times higher than that of rural migrant workers  further analyses based on structural equation models confirm that migrants  current less satisfied life experience and lower level of viability in cities hinder them to become a permanent urban resident  unexpectedly  migrants  permanent residence intentions do not affect their future energy consumption preference  which is however mostly affected by their confidence and barriers to become a permanent resident  especially future concerns about health and lack of social security in their current daily life  finally  it is argued that studies on rural migrants should pay more attention to capability concerned and life oriented aspects  which are useful to derive important insights into cross sectoral energy policymaking   c  2017 elsevier ltd  all rights reserved  
 safe roundabouts for cyclists may roundabouts be safer for cyclists than intersections  how are safe roundabouts designed  this paper tries to answer these questions on the basis of a before after safety study of conversions of intersections to 255 single lane roundabouts in denmark  the before after study accounts for long term accident and injury trends and regression to the mean effects  in order to relate safety effects for cyclists of various roundabout design features it is crucial to split the converted sites by speed limit  because safety effects for both cyclists and other road users of converting intersections to roundabouts depend heavily on speed limits on roads entering the converted sites  if speed limits are 70 km h or higher then converting intersections to roundabouts have resulted in bicycle safety improvements in denmark  results show that diameter and height of central islands and type of bicycle facilities at single lane roundabouts have considerable impacts on cyclists  safety  central island diameters of 20 40 m are safer for cyclists than smaller or larger roundabouts  a central island  which middle is elevated 2 m or more above the circulating lane  is safer for cyclists than single lane roundabouts with lower central islands  single lane roundabouts with separate cycle paths  where cyclists must yield to motorists entering or exiting the roundabout  are safer than roundabouts with cycle lanes  single lane roundabouts are safer for cyclists than intersections regardless of speed limits when these roundabouts have high central islands and or separate cycle paths   c  2016 elsevier ltd  all rights reserved  
 safer driver responses at intersections with green signal countdown timers traffic signal countdown timers  tscts  are innovative  practical  and cost effective technologies with the potential to improve safety at signalized intersections  the purpose of these devices is to assist motorists in decision making at signalized intersections by providing them with real time signal duration information  this study examines us driver responses in the presence of a green signal countdown timer  gsct  and the implications those responses have on intersection safety  a driving simulator study was conducted to record driver responses to virtual gscts  fifty five participants  32 male and 23 female  responded to 1100 simulated traffic signals  half of which had gscts  a predictive model was developed and validated to estimate the change in driver s probability to stop at different distances from the stop line in the presence of a gsct  the presence of a gsct increased average driver stopping probability in the dilemma zone by 13 10   while decreasing average driver deceleration rates by 1 50 ft s 2   these results suggest that gscts may contribute to improved intersection safety in the us   c  2017 elsevier ltd  all rights reserved  
 safety analysis of the new synchronized and milwaukee b interchanges in comparison to existing designs interchanges have high crash rates and large impacts on traffic operations  the main objective of this research is to analyze the safety performance of two new interchanges  the synchronized interchange and the milwaukee b interchange  the primary method of study was microscopic simulation modeling using the surrogate safety assessment model  ssam  program to estimate the quantity and type of conflicting interactions in each interchange  a comprehensive series of simulation scenarios were considered to include different conditions of traffic volumes  traffic turning ratios  traffic distribution  and heavy vehicles percentages  afterward  outcomes were analyzed with two way analyses of variance  anovas  to compare the mean values of conflicts  based on the results  the diverging diamond interchange  ddi  and milwaukee b were the safest designs regarding observed conflicting interactions in the simulation models  however  the ddi did not seem as reliable from the viewpoint of wrong way movements  the new synchronized interchange  the parclo b  and the milwaukee a  an existing interchange in milwaukee  wi  showed the same rate of conflicts  the synchronized interchange may be advantageous because it was estimated to reduce the severity of crashes due to fewer crossing conflicts  a lower speed of conflicts  and a higher time to collision  the conventional diamond was the most dangerous design based on our measures  the ddi and the synchronized interchange look like plausible substitutes for reconstructing an unsafe diamond interchange due to the similarities in their required space  
 safety analysis of urban arterials at the meso level urban arterials form the main structure of street networks  they typically have multiple lanes  high traffic volume  and high crash frequency  classical crash prediction models investigate the relationship between arterial characteristics and traffic safety by treating road segments and intersections as isolated units  this micro level analysis does not work when examining urban arterial crashes because signal spacing is typically short for urban arterials  and there are interactions between intersections and road segments that classical models do not accommodate  signal spacing also has safety effects on both intersections and road segments that classical models cannot fully account for because they allocate crashes separately to intersections and road segments  in addition  classical models do not consider the impact on arterial safety of the immediately surrounding street network pattern  this study proposes a new modeling methodology that will offer an integrated treatment of intersections and road segments by combining signalized intersections and their adjacent road segments into a single unit based on road geometric design characteristics and operational conditions  these are called meso level units because they offer an analytical approach between micro and macro  the safety effects of signal spacing and street network pattern were estimated for this study based on 118 meso level units obtained from 21 urban arterials in shanghai  and were examined using car  conditional auto regressive  models that corrected for spatial correlation among the units within individual arterials  results showed shorter arterial signal spacing was associated with higher total and pdo  property damage only  crashes  while arterials with a greater number of parallel roads were associated with lower total  pdo  and injury crashes  the findings from this study can be used in the traffic safety planning  design  and management of urban arterials  
 safety analytics for integrating crash frequency and real time risk modeling for expressways to find crash contributing factors  there have been numerous crash frequency and real time safety studies  but such studies have been conducted independently  until this point  no researcher has simultaneously analyzed crash frequency and real time crash risk to test whether integrating them could better explain crash occurrence  therefore  this study aims at integrating crash frequency and real time safety analyses using expressway data  a bayesian integrated model and a non integrated model were built  the integrated model linked the crash frequency and the real time models by adding the logarithm of the estimated expected crash frequency in the real time model  the non integrated model independently estimated the crash frequency and the real time crash risk  the results showed that the integrated model outperformed the non integrated model  as it provided much better model results for both the crash frequency and the real time models  this result indicated that the added component  the logarithm of the expected crash frequency  successfully linked and provided useful information to the two models  this study uncovered few variables that are not typically included in the crash frequency analysis  for example  the average daily standard deviation of speed  which was aggregated based on speed at 1 min intervals  had a positive effect on crash frequency  in conclusion  this study suggested a methodology to improve the crash frequency and real time models by integrating them  and it might inspire future researchers to understand crash mechanisms better  
 safety climate and firefighting  focus group results background  firefighting is a hazardous occupation and there have been numerous calls for fundamental changes in how fire service organizations approach safety and balance safety with other operational priorities  these calls  however  have yielded little systematic research  methods  as part of a larger project to develop and test a model of safety climate for the fire service  focus groups were used to identify potentially important dimensions of safety climate pertinent to firefighting  results  analyses revealed nine overarching themes  competency professionalism  physical psychological readiness  and that positive traits sometimes produce negative consequences were themes at the individual level  cohesion and supervisor leadership support at the workgroup level  and politics bureaucracy  resources  leadership  and hiring promotion at the organizational level  a multi level perspective seems appropriate for examining safety climate in firefighting  conclusions  safety climate in firefighting appears to be multidimensional and some dimensions prominent in the general safety climate literature also seem relevant to firefighting  these results also suggest that the fire service may be undergoing transitions encompassing mission  personnel  and its fundamental approach to safety and risk  practical applications  these results help point the way to the development of safety climate measures specific to firefighting and to interventions for improving safety performance   c  2017 national safety council and elsevier ltd  all rights reserved  
 safety evaluation of driver cognitive failures and driving errors on right turn filtering movement at signalized road intersections based on fuzzy cellular automata  fca  model this paper proposes a simulation based approach to estimate safety impact of driver cognitive failures and driving errors  fuzzy logic  which involves linguistic terms and uncertainty  is incorporated with cellular automata model to simulate decision making process of right turn filtering movement at signalized intersections  simulation experiments are conducted to estimate the relationships between cognitive failures and driving errors with safety performance  simulation results show different types of cognitive failures are found to have varied relationship with driving errors and safety performance  for right turn filtering movement  cognitive failures are more likely to result in driving errors with denser conflicting traffic stream  moreover  different driving errors are found to have different safety impacts  the study serves to provide a novel approach to linguistically assess cognitions and replicate decision making procedures of the individual driver  compare to crash analysis  the proposed fca model allows quantitative estimation of particular cognitive failures  and the impact of cognitions on driving errors and safety performance  
 safety evaluation of intersections with dynamic use of exit lanes for left turn using field data as a newly proposed unconventional intersection design  the exit lanes for left turn  efl  intersection is found to be effective in increasing the intersection capacity with high level of application flexibility  especially under heavy left turn traffic conditions  however  the operational safety of efl is of most concern to the authority prior to its implementation  this paper evaluates the safety of the efl intersections by studying the behavior of left turn maneuvers using field data collected at 7 locations in china  a total of 22830 left turn vehicles were captured  in which 9793 vehicles turned left using the mixed usage area  four potential safety problems  including the red light violations  head on collision risks  trapped vehicles  and rear end crash risks  were discussed  statistical analyses were carried out to compare the safety risk between the efl intersection and the conventional one  results indicate that the safety problems of efl intersections mainly lie in higher percentages in red light violations at the pre signal  1 83  higher   wrong way violation problems during the peak hours  the violation rate reaches up to 11 07    and the lower travel speeds in the mixed usage area  18 75  lower   such risks can be counteracted  however  by providing more guiding information  installing cameras to investigate and punish violation maneuvers  and adjusting design parameter values for layout design and signal timing  respectively   c  2017 elsevier ltd  all rights reserved  
 safety factors of exit slip roads on china s urban motorways the number of crashes occurring on motorway exit slip roads is approximately double that occurring on entrance slip roads  a crash on an exit slip road usually causes a decrease in its capacity  leading to queues forming on the main carriageway  the aim of this paper is to evaluate the safety factors for exit slip roads on urban motorways in china  seventy exit slip roads on motorways in shanghai were selected for statistical and regression analyses  negative binomial models were established to identify the influencing factors  the regression results indicate that the slope of the exit slip road  the length of deceleration lane  the length from the slip road terminal to stop line  the exit slip road type and the average annual daily traffic are significant factors with respect to the safety performance of exit slip roads  compared with previous studies  urban motorway exit slip roads in china have complex and specific influencing factors  with the exception of the geometric design of exit slip roads  the slip road street intersection serves an important role in slip road safety

 safety implications of co locating road signs  a driving simulator investigation background  as road complexity increases the requirement for number of road signs also increases  although the amount of road side space does not  one practical strategy to address this is to present multiple road signs on the same gantry  sign co location   however  there is very little research on the safety implications of this practice  method  36 participants  mean age   42 25 years  sd   13 99  18 females  completed three driving simulator scenarios  each scenario had a different sign co location condition  no co location  dual co location and triple co location  each scenario presented similar information using direction signs  variable message signs and variable speed limit signs  under  each drive included standard motorway driving  100 lanth speed zone  in free flow traffic and one emergency event where a lead vehicle suddenly braked  the scenario order was counterbalanced and the emergency event vehicle varied  results  overall  there was no impact of co locating signs on general driving performance  no significant difference was observed between conditions for reaction time and minimum headway in response to the emergency event  participants were able to correctly choose their destination whether the signs were co located or not  discussion  for the particular configuration of signs tested there is no evidence that co location negatively impacts driving performance  however  there may be some implications for travel speed and the manner in which the emergency event is responded to  future work should confirm the findings on real roads  these findings provided support for sign co location as a practical and safe option for displaying multiple road signs in a confined area   c  2017 published by elsevier ltd  
 safety in numbers for cyclists conclusions from a multidisciplinary study of seasonal change in interplay and conflicts in many european countries  it is a political goal that future growth in local travel should be absorbed by sustainable transport modes  concerns that increased walking and cycling produce more accidents have been countered by the  safety in numbers   sin  argument  according to sin  the more walkers cyclists there are in a population  the lower their risk  sin has been demonstrated in cross sectional and longitudinal studies  but the mechanisms behind the effect have yet to be proven  previous studies have mostly relied on register data  the current study  carried out in 2013 and 2014 tests the existence of this effect in a more controlled manner  this is achieved through the use of three data sets   1  roadside survey data with cyclists  pedestrians and car drivers from oslo carried out at three time points in the cycling season  2  a panel study covering the same time period  and  3  video observations at four different locations in oslo  by exploiting the natural seasonal variation in cycling frequency  and by using a repeated measures design we can further control for other factors suggested to lie behind the sin mechanism  such as differences in infrastructure and traffic culture  the results suggest that bicyclists experience a short term safety in numbers effect through the season  each individual cyclist experiences fewer occasions of being overlooked by cars and fewer safety critical situations  near misses   video observation data confirm this pattern  however  the sin effect seems to be countered by another mechanism taking place at the same time  the influx of inexperienced and risk taking cyclists through the season  thus car drivers and pedestrians also report to find themselves being surprised by cyclists in traffic late in the season   c  2016 the author s   published by elsevier ltd

 scalable space time trajectory cube for path finding  a study using big taxi trajectory data route planning is an important daily activity and has been intensively studied owing to their broad applications  extracting the driving experience of taxi drivers to learn about the best routes and to support dynamic route planning can greatly help both end users and governments to ease traffic problems  travel frequency representing the popularity of different road segments plays an important role in experience based path finding models and route computation  however  global frequency used in previous studies does not take into account the dynamic space time characteristics of origins and destinations and the detailed travel frequency in different directions on the same road segment  this paper presents the space time trajectory cube as a framework for dividing and organizing the trajectory space in terms of three dimensions  origin  destination  and time   after that  space time trajectory cube computation and origin destination constrained experience extraction methods are proposed to extract the fine grained experience of taxi drivers based on a dataset of real taxi trajectories  finally  space time constrained graph was generated by merging drivers  experience with the road network to compute optimal routes  the framework and methods were implemented using a taxi trajectory dataset from shenzhen  china  the results show that the proposed methods effectively extracted the driving experience of the taxi drivers and the entailed trade off between route length and travel time for routes with high trajectory coverage  they also indicate that road segment global frequency is not appropriate for representing driving experience in route planning models  these results are important for future research on route planning or path finding methods and their applications in navigation systems   c  2017 elsevier ltd  all rights reserved  
 scale  quality and efficiency in road maintenance  evidence for english local authorities this paper outlines the first econometric stochastic frontier efficiency analysis of road maintenance costs for local authorities in england in the academic literature  it is motivated by current public sector austerity requiring local authorities to provide efficient highway functions both in terms of learning from best practice  economic efficiency  and potential reorganisation to exploit economies of scale  scale efficiency   the analysis utilises a road condition measure and an end user  public  satisfaction indicator as well as road length and traffic factors  the availability of public satisfaction data is particularly important as incorporation of such a measure into benchmarking is currently in its infancy in economic regulation but is increasing in prominence  such as in regulation of health care  evidence is found for an optimal road length which has implications for the current trend to merge the delivery of highways services across local authorities  bigger is not necessarily better  a positive relationship is found between public satisfaction and cost which is strongest for very low or high public satisfaction  finally  the median cost efficiency is 83  which implies many authorities have the opportunity to save substantial sums by adopting best practice without reducing service quality  
 scenario tree airline fleet planning for demand uncertainty this paper proposes an innovative multi period modeling approach to solve the airline fleet planning problem under demand uncertainty  the problem is modeled using a scenario tree approach  the tree is composed of nodes  which represent points of decision in multiple time stages of the planning horizon  and branches  representing demand variation scenarios  the branches link the decision nodes in consequent time stages and compose scenario paths  fleet decisions are modeled according to these scenario paths  resembling the real life process in which fleet plans are not defined in a single moment but instead are adjusted according to the demand development  given that some scenario paths share common decision nodes  decisions among scenarios need to be synchronized  a mixed integer linear programming model is proposed to determine the ideal fleet composition for each scenario in the tree and to describe this interdependency between scenarios  considering the probability of a scenario  fleet composition probabilities for each time period can be determined  two real world based case studies are performed to show the validity of the model  results show that the proposed scenario tree approach can provide flexible multi period airline fleet plans  which are more robust to future demand scenarios than fleet solutions obtained using the traditional approach of considering a single deterministic demand evolution scenario   c  2017 elsevier ltd  all rights reserved  
 school bus routing with stochastic demand and duration constraints the school bus routing problem  sbrp  is crucial because of its impact on economic and social objectives  a single bus is assigned to each route  picking up students and arriving at the school within a specified time window  sbrp aims to find the fewest buses needed to cover all of the routes while minimizing the total travel distance and meeting required constraints  we propose a mathematical formulation responding to the overbooking policies applied in a real world school district  according to our empirical studies  the probability of a student riding a bus varies from 22  to 77   opening the opportunity to overbook the buses to improve utilization of their capacity  however  sbrp with overbooking has not attracted much attention in previous studies  in this work  overbooking is modeled via chance constrained programming  additionally  to account for the uncertainty of the total travel time of the buses  a constraint limiting the probability of being late to school is also proposed in this paper  as a result of the np hard nature of the problem  a cascade simplification algorithm is proposed to partition the multiple stage sbrp problems into multiple multi depot and one school subproblems that are solved sequentially  where the results for one are data inputs for the next  furthermore  we develop column generation based algorithms to solve the scheduling problem  and different instances of the problem are examined  our computational experiments on a real world school district demonstrate desirable cost savings in terms of the total number of buses used

 school travel mode choice in beijing  china this study explores school travel mode choice behavior of 7 18 year old students in beijing  china  based on the data collected in fifth travel survey of beijing inhabitants  the integration of tree based and logit based models is employed to examine the influence of key variables on school travel mode choice  in particular  the tree based model is used to preliminarily select the traits which have a statistical effect on mode choice  and the logit based model is used to provide deeper understanding of the underlying decision processes and the correlation effects of the variables  results show that car ownership  poor walking cycling environment  and adults  convenience for escorting students significantly stimulate the use of cars in school commuting  students are more inclined to choose cars when their departure time is at rush hour compared to the other time  moreover  the longer distance encourages the use of motorized transport  where the households with local hukou  usually related to the car ownership and other welfares  are more willing to drive their children to school  a number of recommendations on car restraint  sustainable travel environment improvement  different working hour implementing  and educational resources layout for the encouragement and promotion of sustainable travel practices are lastly proposed  
 scrubber  a potentially overestimated compliance method for the emission control areas the importance of involving a ship s sailing pattern in the evaluation different methods for sulphur emission reductions  available to satisfy the latest emission control areas  eca  regulations  may lead to different sailing patterns  route and speed choices of a vessel  and thus have significant impact on a shipping company s operating costs  however  the current literature does not include sailing pattern optimization caused by eca  and its corresponding cost effects  in the evaluation and selection process for sulphur abatement technology  this leads to an inaccurate estimation of the value of certain technologies and hence an incorrect investment decision  in this paper  we integrate the optimization of a ship s sailing pattern into the lifespan cost assessment of the emission control technology  so that such expensive and irreversible decisions can be made more accurately  the results shows that a considerable overestimation of the value of scrubbers  and thus a substantial loss  can occur if the sailing pattern of a ship is not considered in the decision making process  furthermore  we also illustrate that it is more important to involve a ship s sailing pattern when the port call density inside eca is low   c  2017 elsevier ltd  all rights reserved  
 segmentation of passengers using full service and low cost carriers   evidence from taiwan low cost carriers in taiwan have rapidly drawn a large number of passengers away from full service carriers in recent years  however  many passengers still stick with traditional airlines as their primary air carriers  these two groups of passengers should differ in terms of their personal and trip characteristics  valuations of factors in determining an airline  and perceptions of need for ancillary services  the present paper compares the profiles of passengers using different types of air services in taiwan using data collected from an online survey and assesses the potential of principal component analysis with biplot technique to define different passengers based on their preferences of services and valuations of the importance of factors  our study shows that passengers of full service and low cost carriers have different trip characteristics  principal component analysis is applicable for this context of passenger profile segmentations   c  2017 elsevier ltd  all rights reserved  
 self fulfilling signal of an endogenous state in network congestion games we consider the problem of coordination via signaling in network congestion games to improve social welfare deteriorated by incomplete information about traffic flow  traditional studies on signaling  which focus on exogenous factors of congestion and ignore congestion externalities  fail to discuss the oscillations of traffic flow  to address this gap  we formulate a problem of designing a coordination signal on endogenous information about traffic flow and introduce a self fulfilling characteristic of a signal that guarantees an outcome flow consistent with the signal itself without causing the unwanted oscillation  an instance of the self fulfilling signal is shown in the case of a gaussian signal distribution  in addition  we show simple numerical examples  the results reveal how a self fulfilling signal suppresses the oscillation and simultaneously improves social welfare through improved network efficiency  
 self monitoring of driving speed in vehicle data recorders  ivdr  have been found to facilitate safe driving and are highly valuable in accident analysis  nevertheless  it is not easy to convince drivers to use them  part of the difficulty is related to the  big brother  concern  installing ivdr impairs the drivers  privacy  the  big brother  concern can be mitigated by adding a turn off switch to the ivdr  however  this addition comes at the expense of increasing speed variability between drivers  which is known to impair safety  the current experimental study examines the significance of this negative effect of a turn off switch under two experimental settings representing different incentive structures  small and large fines for speeding  199 students were asked to participate in a computerized speeding dilemma task  where they could control the speed of their  car  using  brake  and  speed  buttons  corresponding to automatic car foot pedals  the participants in two experimental conditions had ivdr installed in their  cars   and were told that they could turn it off at any time  driving with active ivdr implied some probability of  fines  for speeding  and the two experimental groups differed with respect to the fine s magnitude  small or large  the results indicate that the option to use ivdr reduced speeding and speed variance  in addition  the results indicate that the reduction of speed variability was maximal in the small fine group  these results suggest that using ivdr with gentle fines and with a turn off option maintains the positive effect of ivdr  addresses the  big brother  concern  and does not increase speed variance  
 self reported dimensions of aberrant behaviours among drivers in pakistan this paper has explored aberrant behaviours of drivers in pakistan with the help of extended violation scale of the modified manchester driver behaviour questionnaire  principal component analysis with promax rotation reveals that the drivers in the country have four discrete behavioural dimensions including aggressive driving  unlawful driving  risky driving  and egoistic driving  further  univariate descriptive indicate that the study s drivers engage in risky overtaking and close following more than drunk driving or speeding  the results also demonstrate that the behaviour of drivers is attributable to their personal characteristics and being young  affluent or separated divorced can negatively influence it   c  2017 elsevier ltd  all rights reserved  
 self reported speed compliance and attitudes towards speeding in a representative sample of drivers in australia background  vehicle speed is a major contributor to road trauma  both in terms of increased crash risk and injury severity  in australia  approximately one third of fatal crashes occur in speed zones of 100 km h  this proportion has remained the same  despite the reduction in the number of road fatalities over the past decade  to drive further reductions in speed related crashes  an improved understanding of the underlying determinants of speed choice is required  method  a community attitude survey designed to understand speed behaviour and attitudes towards speeding was distributed to a large  n   5179  representative sample of drivers in australia  participants provided information regarding their normal speed choices across four different speed zones  40  50  60 and 100 km h   beliefs about the risks and enforcement of speeding behaviour as well as technology to reduce speeding  results  almost half of the sample  47   reported exceeding the speed limit in 100 km h zones  although only a small number of these drivers    0 5   did so by 11 km h or more  age and sex were related to speed limit noncompliance  males were more likely to be classified as mid level speeders  defined as being up to 10 km h over the limit  and excessive speeders  11   km h over the limit   younger drivers were also more likely to be noncompliant  when compared to compliant drivers  non compliers perceived less risk of a serious crash  reported greater likelihood of exceeding the speed limit when they believed they would not be detected  and reported a higher level of social acceptability of speeding  only one third of the sample reported prior knowledge of intelligent speed assist  isa  technology  however  once explained  the majority agreed it would be personally useful  64    speed non compliers were somewhat less likely to support the usefulness of isa than speed limit compliant drivers  conclusion  these findings can be used to target appropriate interventions and road safety messages  aimed at reducing speeding behaviour  measures designed to address perceived social acceptability of speed behaviour  the increased crash risk associated with speeding  and the threat of detection are recommended  
 semi autonomous vehicle motor insurance  a bayesian network risk transfer approach all developed economies mandate at least third party auto insurance resulting inw a vast global liability industry  the evolution towards semi autonomous and eventually driverless vehicles will progressively remove the leading cause of vehicle accidents  human error  and significantly lower vehicle accident rates  however  this transition will force a departure from existing actuarial methods requires careful management to ensure risks are correctly assigned  personal motor insurance lines are anticipated to diminish as liability shifts towards oems  tier 1 and 2 suppliers and software developers  vehicle accident risks will hinge on vehicular characteristics in addition to driver related risks as drivers alternate between autonomous and manual driving modes  this paper proposes a bayesian network statistical risk estimation approach that can accommodate changing risk levels and the emergence of new risk structures  we demonstrate the use of this method for a level 3 semi autonomous vehicle for two scenarios  one where the driver is in control and one where the vehicle is in control  this approach is especially suited to use telematics data generated from the vehicle inherent technologies  we validate the efficacy of this approach from the perspective of the insurer and discuss how vehicle technology development will require a greater degree of collaboration between the insurance company and the manufacturers in order to develop a greater understanding of the risks semiautonomous and fully autonomous vehicles   c  2017 elsevier ltd  all rights reserved  
 sensitivity to reward and risky driving  risky decision making  and risky health behaviour  a literature review young driver road safety has persisted as a global problem for decades  despite copious and diverse intervention  recently the influence in reward sensitivity  which refers to the individual s personal sensitivity to rewards  has received attention in health related research  including more generally through decision making in risky circumstances  and in risky driving behaviour specifically  as such  a literature review and synthesis of the literature regarding reward sensitivity in relation to risky driving  risky decision making  and risky health behaviour  with a focus on literature in which adolescents and young adults feature  is timely  thirty one papers were identified  and the literature revealed that young drivers with greater reward sensitivity engage in more risky driving behaviours including speeding  crashes and traffic violations  and that individuals with greater reward sensitivity engage in more risky decision making and other risky health related behaviours  such as drinking and drug use   adolescents and young adults exhibit heightened sensitivity to rewards in the presence of peers  which has considerable implications for young driver road safety as research consistently demonstrates that carrying peer passengers places all vehicle occupants at greater risk of being involved in a road crash  consideration of the influence of reward sensitivity in young driver road safety  and other adolescent young adult health related safety  appears to be a promising avenue of intervention  with gain framed messages more likely to be accepted by young drivers with greater reward sensitivity  future research in jurisdictions other than australia and europe will increase our understanding of the influence of reward sensitivity  and exploration of the differential impacts of reward responsiveness and fun seeking specifically are warranted   c  2017 elsevier ltd  all rights reserved  
 sensor layout strategy and sensitivity analysis for macroscopic traffic flow parameter acquisition an increased number of sensors used in traffic networks to obtain more information will lead to higher costs  this study proposes a minimum investment model for optimal traffic network sensor layout  which considers the spatial distribution characteristics of traffic information  homogeneity of various link locations  and total project costs  the model divides a road network into link sections and network nodes and determines the key points  through segmentation  the model simplifies the network optimisation problem into a multi section optimisation problem  and the model is tested and validated in a field test for a typical road network consisting of an expressway and several arterial roads in beijing  it is shown that the proposed model effectively solves the network sensor location problem for traffic information acquisition  while comprehensive and reliable traffic information is obtained at any given location in the road network to meet the practical engineering requirements  this model produces sensor layout strategies with minimum cost  and provides guidance for engineering applications in the field  finally  by analysing the sensitivity of model parameters  some recommended sensor layout strategies are proposed to reduce the investment cost and provide a decision making basis for traffic information acquisition implementation and fine traffic management  
 service refusals in supply chains  drivers and deterrents of freight rejection contracts in the for hire trucking industry are unusual in that  although they establish prices for different services  there is typically no legally binding obligation or penalty for either party to offer or accept a load  when a load is rejected by all contract carriers  shippers must turn to the spot market  which can significantly increase supply chain costs  because these transactions occur between private parties  data on load acceptances rejections and contract spot prices have not been available to academic researchers  leaving the freight rejection problem largely unexplored  we are able to examine this problem using a detailed transactional data set of a large national shipper  we estimate that spot prices for truckload services average about 62  higher than contract rates  we find key operational and economic factors to be drivers of freight rejection and the shipper carrier relationship to be a deterrent to freight rejection  we also find that primary and secondary carriers respond differently to these operational and economic factors  we discuss how these insights could be used by a shipper to get better performance and lower cost from their carrier base

 sharing riders  how bikesharing impacts bus ridership in new york city the objective of this research is to quantify the impact that bikesharing systems have on bus ridership  we exploit a natural experiment of the phased implementation of a bike sharing system to different areas of new york city  this allows us to use a difference in differences identification strategy  we divide bus routes into control and treatment groups based on if they are located in areas that received bikesharing infrastructure or not  we find a significant decrease in bus ridership on treated routes compared to control routes that coincides with the implementation of the bikesharing system in new york city  the results from our preferred model indicate that every thousand bikesharing docks along a bus route is associated with a 2 42  fall in daily unlinked bus trips on routes in manhattan and brooklyn  a second model that also controls for the expansion of bike lanes during this time suggests that the decrease in bus ridership attributable to bikesharing infrastructure alone may be smaller  a 1 69  fall in daily unlinked bus trips   although the magnitude of the reduction is a small proportion of total bus trips  these findings indicate that either a large proportion of overall bikeshare members are substituting bikesharing for bus trips or that bikesharing may have impacted the travel behavior of non members  such as private bicyclists  understanding how bikesharing and public transit systems are interrelated is vital for planning a mutually reinforcing sustainable transport network   c  2017 elsevier ltd  all rights reserved  
 shedding light on the psychological and behavioral determinants of travel mode choice  a meta analysis mobility represents a relevant topic from the standpoint of environmental degradation  health related consequences and social inclusion  since private mobility is responsible for the greatest share of polluting emissions  it is necessary to gain deeper understanding of the mechanisms underpinning the choice of individuals to use either cars or alternative  environment friendly transport modes  a meta analysis on 58 primary studies is conducted to synthesize evidence on the determinants of travel mode choice  as regards both behavioral intentions and actual behaviors  results suggest that  besides intentions  habits and past use represent the most relevant predictor  followed by constructs referring to the theory of planned behavior framework  environmental variables  on the other hand  play a relevant role in shaping behavioral intentions while their effect on actual behaviors is negligible  so that a deep intention behavior gap emerges  a moderator analysis is performed to explain the high heterogeneity in the results  behaviors  operationalization and measurement emerges as the moderator affecting heterogeneity of outcomes the most  trip purpose  sample type and year of the study also show a moderate effect on heterogeneity  while location does not appear to be a relevant moderator   c  2017 elsevier ltd  all rights reserved  
 shipping emissions in a nordic port  assessment of mitigation strategies we use a bottom up approach to develop a comprehensive emissions inventory for the port of oslo for current and future scenarios  including compliance with environmental legislation  we estimate the emission of air pollutants  nox  pm10  so2  and greenhouse gases  ghgs  co2  ch4  n2o  from shipping and land activities in the port  the inventory shows that oceangoing vessels are the main contributor  providing 63 78  of the total nox  pm10  so2 and co2e emissions  the main contributors among oceangoing vessels are international ferries  cruises and container vessels  and the main contributors to emissions among harbour vessels are domestic ferries  we estimate the emissions from oceangoing vessels for different operational modes  obtaining the highest values at berth followed by emissions during vessel manoeuvres  we evaluate a 2020 scenario that takes account of  i  the expected increase in maritime traffic   ii  compliance with a new regulation regarding sulphur content in ship fuel   0 1    and  iii  implementation of various mitigation measures  these measures include implementation of onshore power  and its combination with a speed reduction zone in the port  and the increase use of liquid natural gas  lng   the results show that compliance with regulation provides a reduction of 90  and 10  in so2 and pm10 emissions  respectively  onshore power in combination with a speed reduction zone provides reductions of up to 15  in nox and co2 emissions by 2020 compared with 2013  and further reductions of up to 23   nox  and 17   co2e  if we extend the use of lng among domestic ferries   c  2017 elsevier ltd  all rights reserved  
 should china further expand its high speed rail network  consider the low cost carrier factor this paper examines china s large scale high speed rail  hsr  expansion  announced in july 2016  and the associated benefits assessment of the expansion program from the perspective of hsr lcc  low cost carriers  interactions  our analysis suggests that in the highly populated and developed corridors the hsr expansion is likely to leave lccs with little survival room  which is also shown by our case study on spring airlines  on the other hand  in the low density corridors especially in the central and western china  lccs might leave hsr with little survival room in the long run  by conducting a  propensity score matching  to pair hsr linked city pairs in china to the counterfactual us airline routes  we find that most of these chinese routes would be viable markets for lccs to operate  the benefits of hsr expansion may thus be overestimated if not recognizing the lccs  role as an alternative mode to serve these markets  in particular  for the routes to the central and western china with very small travel demand and high hsr construction cost  lcc service could be more cost efficient and operationally flexible than hsr  our analysis calls for a more careful evaluation of the program and  more generally  a balanced and coordinated hsr and lcc development in china   c  2017 elsevier ltd  all rights reserved

 simulating deep co2 emission reduction in transport in a general equilibrium framework  the gem e3t model transport sector restructuring to achieve deep ghg emission cuts has attracted much attention because transportation is important for the economy and inflexible in greenhouse gas emission reduction  the aim of this paper is to simulate transition towards low carbon transportation in the european union until 2050 and to assess the ensuing macroeconomic and sectorial impacts  transport restructuring is dynamically simulated using a new transport oriented version of the computable general equilibrium model gem e3 which is linked with the primes tremove energy and transport sectors model  the analysis draws from comparing a reference scenario projection for the eu member states up to 2050 to alternative transport policy scenarios and sensitivities which involve deep cutting of co2 emissions  the simulations show that transport restructuring affects the economy through multiple channels  including investment in infrastructure  the purchasing and manufacturing of new technology vehicles  the production of alternative fuels  such as biofuels and electricity  the analysis identifies positive impacts of industrial activity and other sectors stemming from these activities  however  the implied costs of freight and passenger transportation are of crucial importance for the net impact on gdp and income  should the transport sector transformation imply high unit costs of transport services  crowding out effects in the economy can offset the benefits  this implies that the technology and productivity progress assumptions can be decisive for the sign of gdp impacts  a robust conclusion is that the transport sector decarbonisation  is likely to have only small negative impacts on the eu gdp compared to business as usual   c  2016 elsevier ltd  all rights reserved

 simulating physical basis risks in the capesize freight market the purpose of this paper is to evaluate the characteristics of the time varying differential between the baltic global trip charter average and simulated earnings from a fleet of capesize vessels  we interpret the standard deviation of this differential as a measure of physical basis risk in freight market hedging  resulting from differences in assumed trading patterns and the sequential fixing of vessels at different regional rates around the world  we simulate the average earnings of a fleet over time by sequentially assigning vessels to any of the four main trading routes  trans atlantic  trans pacific  fronthaul and backhaul  with a conditional probability based on known historical commodity flows  we show that increasing the fleet size lowers the basis risk but that this diversification effect is low beyond a relatively small fleet size of about 10 ships  furthermore  we show that this physical basis risk never disappears  even for a very large fleet  due to a moving average effect in earnings  finally  we illustrate that physical basis risk is greater for short hedging durations  the results are important for shipowners and operators in the design of cost efficient hedging programmes and for the baltic exchange and its stakeholders engaged in the continuous improvement of the quality of its spot rate indices  
 simulation model of security control system functioning  a case study of the wroclaw airport terminal a security control system is the key element at an airport because each passenger must undergo security check before boarding  security control must be performed efficiently while maintaining a high level of safety  this article presents a security control model that is applied at a given airport  a set of variable input data describing the model and data received by the user as a result of its use is presented  the security control model is developed using the flexsim software and based on security control model implementation  for which algorithm for managing the security checkpoint operation schedule are used  the algorithm allows a capacity lack margin to be established in the security control system in order to lower the system operation cost and maintain an acceptable passenger service quality  we describe two basic patterns of implementing the security control process  single  and double lane counters  the security control counter has been divided into specific areas  queues   the developed model was implemented into the management system of the security checkpoint at wroclaw airport  measures of the system s capacity are determined for the following sample input data  system characteristics and the stream of passenger reports   the average duration of a passenger s stay in the security control system and the number of operator work hours depending on the adopted management strategy  the developed model can be used in existing security control systems and also to evaluate the operation of a system at its design stage   c  2016 elsevier ltd  all rights reserved  
 simulation  numerical approximation and closed forms for joint discrete continuous models with an application to household vehicle ownership and use integrated models for multiple decision variables  not necessarily from the same family  are becoming possible thanks to the advances in econometrics and in the estimation techniques  recently  probit type models have been proposed to model joint decisions for the flexibility offered by the multivariate normal to capture correlations across the different dependent variables  ordered probit models are in general preferred to unordered probit for the saving in computational costs deriving from the closed mathematical form of the choice probabilities  in this study  we compare results obtained from unordered probit models estimated with simulation and numerical computation to those obtained from ordered discrete continuous probit  the analysis is performed on household decisions concerning vehicle holding and mileage travelled and using data extracted from the 2009 national household travel survey  estimation results show that discrete continuous unordered probit are superior to ordered structures in terms of goodness of fit  but produce comparable results when applied to predict behavioral changes  model applications for policy analysis also reveal that income and density only affects marginally vehicle holding decisions and annual miles driven  while driving cost has a more significant effect on annual household mileage  
 simulation based optimization  achieving computational efficiency through the use of multiple simulators transportation agencies often resort to the use of traffic simulation models to evaluate the impacts of changes in network design or network operations  they often have multiple traffic simulation tools that cover the network area where changes are to be made  these multiple simulators may differ in their modeling assumptions  e g   macroscopic versus microscopic   in their reliability  e g   quality of their calibration   as well as in their modeling scale  e g   city scale versus regional scale   the choice of which simulation model to rely on  let alone of how to combine their use  is intricate  a larger scale model may  for instance  capture more accurately the local global interactions  yet may do so at a greater computational cost  this paper proposes an optimization framework that enables multiple simulation models to be jointly and efficiently used to address continuous urban transportation optimization problems  we propose a simulation based optimization algorithm that embeds information from both a high accuracy low efficiency simulator and a low accuracy high efficiency simulator  at every iteration  the algorithm decides which simulator to evaluate  this decision is based on an analytical approximation of the accuracy loss as a result of running the lower accuracy model  we formulate an analytical expression that is based on a differentiable and computationally efficient to evaluate traffic assignment model  we evaluate the performance of the algorithm with a traffic signal control problem on both a small network and a city network  we show that the proposed algorithm identifies signal plans with excellent performance  and can do so at a significantly lower computational cost than when systematically running the high accuracy simulator  the proposed methodology contributes to enable large scale high resolution traffic simulation models to be used efficiently for simulation based optimization  more broadly  it enables the use of multiple simulation models that may differ  for instance  in their scale  their resolution  or their computational costs  to be used jointly for optimization

 single vehicle crashes along rural mountainous highways in malaysia  an application of random parameters negative binomial model mountainous highways generally associate with complex driving environment because of constrained road geometries  limited cross section elements  inappropriate roadside features  and adverse weather conditions  as a result  single vehicle  sv  crashes are overrepresented along mountainous roads  particularly in developing countries  but little attention is known about the roadway geometric  traffic and weather factors contributing to these sv crashes  as such  the main objective of the present study is to investigate sv crashes using detailed data obtained from a rigorous site survey and existing databases  the final dataset included a total of 56 variables representing road geometries including horizontal and vertical alignment  traffic characteristics  real time weather condition  cross sectional elements  roadside features  and spatial characteristics  to account for structured heterogeneities resulting from multiple observations within a site and other unobserved heterogeneities  the study applied a random parameters negative binomial model  results suggest that rainfall during the crash is positively associated with sv crashes  but real time visibility is negatively associated  the presence of a road shoulder  particularly a bitumen shoulder or wider shoulders  along mountainous highways is associated with less sv crashes  while speeding along downgrade slopes increases the likelihood of sv crashes  proper delineation decreases the likelihood  findings of this study have significant implications for designing safer highways in mountainous areas  particularly in the context of a developing country   c  2017 elsevier ltd  all rights reserved  
 size matters  how vehicle body type affects consumer preferences for electric vehicles electric vehicles  evs  hold great promise for reducing greenhouse gas emissions  yet achieving their environmental benefits depends on greater market uptake  while a growing body of literature has sought to offer information on consumer stated preferences for evs  to date no research has examined how preferences for hybrid  plug in hybrid  and battery electric vehicles are shaped by vehicle body size or type  the automobile market is differentiated with vehicle attributes that respond to heterogeneous consumer demands  we hypothesize that each bundle of attributes as it relates to vehicle body size also shapes demand for evs  using a large primary dataset  we segment respondents according to their preferred next vehicle body type  economy  intermediate  full size sedan  luxury  minivan  sport utility  and pickup   multivariate analysis of variance  manova  results show significant differences in the socioeconomic  demographic  and psychological profile of consumers across the seven vehicle segments  from this  discrete choice models detail how vehicle type plays a significant role in the choicemaking behaviour of potential ev consumers  while factors like age  education  and the importance of fuel economy and reduced or eliminated emissions generally play a consistent role in improving the utility of evs  our results also reveal significant heterogeneity in choice of powertrain across vehicle segments  with luxury and pickup buyers among the most distinct  the results offer useful information for marketing  policy  and research   c  2017 elsevier ltd  all rights reserved

 social inequalities in child pedestrian traffic injuries  differences in neighborhood built environments near schools in austin  tx  usa there have been many efforts to enhance pedestrian safety for children because school aged children are one of the most vulnerable groups to traffic injury  however  we have limited understanding as to how the built environment affects child pedestrian safety around schools  further  most previous studies have overlooked the fact that the built environment that support child pedestrian safety may vary across neighborhood heterogeneity  this study addresses these gaps by examining the impacts of the built environments on child pedestrian crashes around schools in austin  texas  usa  we use the binary logistic regression model with firth s penalized likelihood method to estimate the impacts of built environments on child pedestrian crashes at the street segment level  this study finds that longer block lengths  missing sidewalks  crosswalk density  and commercial land uses around schools may hinder child pedestrian safety  moreover  we find that socioeconomically disadvantaged children may have little to no protection against the risk of pedestrian crashes  especially due to lack of sidewalks and well designed crosswalks  our results may help planners  policymakers  and public health professionals better understand how to enhance child pedestrian safety around schools by improving surrounding built environments based on different neighborhood characteristics  
 social inequalities of park accessibility in shenzhen  china  the role of park quality  transport modes  and hierarchical socioeconomic characteristics identifying the geographic units with restricted access to intra urban parks has become a hot issue in transport studies  previous literature has examined the social inequalities of park accessibility under the western context  however  the issue has seldomly investigated against the non western background  especially in china  using a case of shenzhen  china   this paper examines the accessibility to parks of three quality levels  official standard  under four transport modes  public transit  walking  bicycle  and private car   in particular  the daily travel time from each community  8117  to each park  625  was harvested from the baidu map during 18 30 20 30 in july 2016  we further  based on the travel time calculations  develop four baseline indicators  the weighted average  the minimum  the maximum  and the standard deviation travel time  and three tolerance indicators of park accessibility  weighted average travel time within visit tolerance thresholds  standard deviation travel time within visit tolerance thresholds  and number of parks within visit tolerance thresholds  to measure park accessibility for each community  results show that the seven accessibility indicators generate different estimations and the quantified accessibility varies greatly with park quality levels and transport modes  communities present greater variations in accessibility to the first quality level and second quality level parks via walking and public transit  in addition  hierarchical regression is utilized to quantify the relationships between park accessibility and sociodemographic characteristics at two geographic levels  community and district   it is found that the associations are subjected to park quality  transport modes  and geographic levels  in particular  we discover significant social inequalities in park accessibility under the mode of public transit  walking  and bicycle  our study should provide some new insights into accessibility research and advance the understanding of unequal park provision in developing countries  
 social influence in the global diffusion of alternative fuel vehicles   a meta analysis alternative fuel vehicle technologies are needed to mitigate rising greenhouse gas emissions from transport  social influence is integral to the diffusion of private vehicles which are highly visible and fulfil practical as well as social functions  this paper provides the first meta analysis of empirical studies which measure the strength of social influence on consumer vehicle choice  a systematic literature review identified 21 studies that examined three types of social influence  interpersonal communication  neighbourhood effect  and conformity with social norms  a random effects meta analysis found a significant and small to moderate effect of social influence on vehicle choices  r   0 241  p   0 001   the overall effect size did not vary significantly between types of social influence nor between types of vehicle  conventional or alternative fuel   however  further analysis using meta regression found that heterogeneity in social influence effect size across studies was explained by differences in countries  cultural receptiveness to normative influence  these findings have important implications for policy and modelling analysis of alternative fuel vehicle adoption  for which diffusion is both a socially and culturally mediated process  
 social marketing and the built environment  what matters for travel behaviour change  social marketing and the built environment are two important  tools  to manage travel demand which have had significant attention in the literature separately  most previous studies evaluating the effects of social marketing programs have relied on pre  and post  surveys  using self reported measures without any objective measures of travel behaviour change  further  there is a lack of evidence on whether the effects of the built environment are synergistic when combined with other intervention programs  such as social marketing programs  this study contributes by quantitatively evaluating the relative and combined effects of the travelsmart and the built environment on travel behaviour using objective gps measurements  between 2012 and 2014  daily travel data were collected using gps equipment in suburbs of inner northern adelaide  south australia  individuals in the households aged over 14 carried a portable gps device everywhere for a period of 15 days during march may in each year from 2012 to 2014  providing a total of three waves of panel data  the empirical analysis suggests that the travelsmart program as a  treatment  significantly reduced the car trips soon after implementation with longer term effects on reducing car trips in high walkable neighbourhoods  for walking and bus trips  the travelsmart program increased these 1 year after the  treatment  with stronger effects on travel behaviour change for the participants living in high walkable neighbourhoods than for those living in low walkable neighbourhoods  
 socioeconomic and demographic differences in walking and cycling in the netherlands  how do these translate into differences in health benefits  walking and cycling are effective means to increase people s daily physical activity  since little is known about how differences in walking and cycling translate into inequalities in health benefits on the population level  this study quantified these health benefits for demographic and socioeconomic groups in the netherlands  population representative data on walking and cycling among adults  aged 20 90 years  for the period 2010 2014 were analyzed with the health economic assessment tool  heat   results showed pronounced differences between subgroups  with women  senior citizens  50 79 years   higher socioeconomic groups  and native dutch people walking and cycling more than others  given the relatively high mortality rates and high levels of walking and cycling among senior citizens  it was found that a large number of deaths were prevented in that age group  in lower socioeconomic groups  despite their lower walking and cycling levels  it was found that even more deaths were prevented  given their large population size and higher mortality rates  the proportion of health benefits was found to be greater among the native dutch because their walking and cycling levels as well as their population size were higher than among non native groups  the study suggests that policies to increase walking and cycling among lower socioeconomic groups could induce further health benefits in the aggregate and thus help mitigate socioeconomic health inequalities  
 socioeconomic impacts of transportation public private partnerships  a dynamic cge assessment while value for money and benefit cost analyses represent traditional approaches for public private partnership  p3  evaluation  these methods primarily focus on direct  project level impacts  indirect regional economic and or social welfare impacts are generally ignored  this study fills the gap by investigating transportation infrastructure p3 s socioeconomic impacts using a dynamic computable general equilibrium  cge  model  using the u s  commonwealth of virginia s i 495 express lanes project as an example  the model measures infrastructure capital expenditure and tax shock effects and compares them with two public sector comparators  pscs  representing lower and upper bound scenarios  the model also captures the impacts of capital accumulation and temporal variations during the 2008 2012 construction period  the simulation results show that by alleviating the regional economy s collected tax burden  p3s generate greater positive gross economic output and welfare impacts than traditional public financing models  
 sofie  a bicycle that supports older cyclists  older cyclists remain at high risk of sustaining an injury after a fall with their bicycle  a growing awareness for the need and possibilities to support safety of older cyclists has been leading to bicycle design ideas  however  the effectiveness and acceptance of such designs has not been studied yet  this study aims to analyse the effect of 3 support systems  an automatic adjustable saddle height  optimised frame and wheel geometry and drive off assistance  the support systems are integrated on the sofie bicycle  a prototype bicycle designed to support older cyclists during  dis  mounting and at lower cycling speeds  nine older cyclists  65 80 years  were asked to cycle on a  normal  and on the  sofie  bicycle  they cycled on a parking lot to avoid interaction with traffic  the following tasks were analysed  cycling at comfortable and low speed avoiding an obstacle and  dis  mounting the bicycle  bicycle and cyclist motions were recorded with 10 inertial measurement units and by 2 video cameras  fusion software  labview  was used to assess kinematic parameters  first  a subjective analysis of the different cycling tasks was made  supported by video analysis  second  differences in cyclist and bicycle kinematic parameters between the normal and sofie bicycle were studied for the various cycling tasks  the sofie bicycle was experienced as a  supportive  and comfortable bicycle and objectively performed  safer  on various cycling tasks  for example  the optimised frame geometry with low step in enabled a faster  dis  mounting time and less sternum roll angle and angular acceleration  the adjustable saddle height enabled the participants to keep both feet on the ground till they started cycling with the  drive off  support  the latter reduces steering activity  maximum steer angle and angular acceleration  during sudden obstacle avoidance  less upper body and thigh accelerations are recorded  in conclusion  the sofie bicycle was able to support older cyclists during various cycling tasks and may reduce fall risk   c  2016 elsevier ltd  all rights reserved  
 solving the air conflict resolution problem under uncertainty using an iterative biobjective mixed integer programming approach in this paper  we tackle the aircraft conflict resolution problem under uncertainties  we consider errors due to the wind effect  the imprecision of aircraft speed prediction  and the delay in the execution of maneuvers  using a geometrical approach  we derive an analytical expression for the minimum distance between aircraft  along with the corresponding probability of conflict  these expressions are incorporated into an existing deterministic model for conflict resolution  this model solves the problem as a maximum clique of minimum weight in a graph whose vertices represent possible maneuvers and where edges link conflict free maneuvers of different aircraft  we then present a solution procedure focusing on two criteria  namely  fuel efficiency and the probability of reissuing maneuvers in the future  we iteratively generate pareto front solutions to provide the controller with a set of possible solutions where she can choose the one corresponding the most to her preferences  intensive monte carlo simulations validate the expressions derived for the minimum distance and the probability of conflict  computational results highlight that up to 10 different solutions for instances involving up to 35 aircraft are generated within 3 minutes  
 solving the gate assignment problem through the fuzzy bee colony optimization in the field of swarm intelligence  the bee colony optimization  bco  has proven to be capable of solving high level combinatorial problems  like the flight gate assignment problem  fgap   with fast convergence performances  however  given that the fgap can be often affected by uncertainty or approximation in data  in this paper we develop a new metaheuristic algorithm  based on the fuzzy bee colony optimization  fbco   which integrates the concepts of bco with a fuzzy inference system  the proposed method assigns  through the multicriteria analysis  airport gates to scheduled flights based on both passengers  total walking distance and use of remote gates  to find an optimal flight to gate assignment for a given schedule  comparison of the results with the schedules of real airports has allowed us to show the characteristics of the proposed concepts and  at the same time  it stressed the effectiveness of the proposed method   c  2017 elsevier ltd  all rights reserved  
 sourcing truckload capacity in the transportation spot market  a framework for third party providers due to uncertainty in supply chains and carrier networks stretched thin by demand  it is sometimes necessary for shippers to procure capacity for shipments on the transportation spot market  the transportation spot market is a mechanism by which unfulfilled and urgent demand is satisfied  shipments are tendered one at a time on a load by load basis  because of the often severe shortage of spot market capacity and its relatively high and volatile prices  shippers must actively as opposed to passively seek carrier capacity  often  they turn to third parties  this research considers third party brokers  3pl  or non asset carriers  operating in the spot market  on behalf of shippers  these brokers take responsibility for shipments and secure capacity for them  the paper proposes a behaviourally based conceptual framework that uses 3pl broker data to improve the search for capacity on the spot market  it seeks to improve the effectiveness of the search process by combining  1  broker data on the availability of carrier capacity   2  a priori information on a particular carrier s likely response to various prices to service a load  the reservation price   and  3  the ability to source multiple loads simultaneously  bundling   these components are incorporated into a framework that enables brokers to better prioritize the carriers they contact  thereby improving outcomes in terms of lower carrier costs and reduced search effort   c  2016 elsevier ltd  all rights reserved  
 spatial competition and complementarity in european port regions the purpose of this study is to investigate whether inter port relationships in european container shipping are characterized primarily by competition or complementarity  and to what extent this differs between major port regions  utilizing a set of spatial dependence model specifications and quarterly container throughput data for 92 european ports in five regions between 2000 and 2014  it is found that the nature of inter port relationships tend to differ between major port regions  while the hamburg le havre region is characterized mostly by competition  ports in the mediterranean region are found to be complementary with regard to demand  
 spatial effects on hybrid electric vehicle adoption this paper examines spatial effects on hybrid electric vehicle  hev  adoption  this is in contrast to most existing analyses  which concentrate on analyzing socioeconomic factors and demographics  this paper uses a general spatial model to estimate the strength of  neighbor effects  on hev adoption namely that each consumer s hev adoption decision can be influenced by the hev adoption decisions of geographic neighbors  we use detailed census tract level demographic data from the 2010 united states census and the 2012 american community survey and vehicle registration data collected by the ohio bureau of motor vehicles  we find that hev adoption exhibits significant spatial effects  we further conduct a time series analysis and show that historical hev adoption has a spatial effect on future adoption  these results suggest that hevs may appear in more dense clusters than models that do not consider spatial effects predict   c  2017 elsevier ltd  all rights reserved  
 spatial variations in active mode trip volume at intersections  a local analysis utilizing geographically weighted regression geographically weighted regression  gwr  models have been employed in previous studies regarding vehicular travel demands  but few studies have locally modeled walking travel demands at intersections to address the issue of spatially varying relationships  harnessing a comprehensive collection of walking and bicycling traffic counts over 10 years in chittenden county  vermont  us  along with socioeconomic characteristics  transit accessibility indices  land use attributes and characteristics of intersections and roadway networks  this study utilizes gwr models to identify whether there are spatially varying relationships between active mode travel demands and ambient built environment attributes  one ordinary least square  ols  model and two gwr models were parametrically calibrated  a full gwr model of all local variables and a mixed gwr model of both global and local variables  k fold cross validation method is used to select variables that significantly influence the volume of active travel modes in the ols model  the uniform set of variables is investigated in two gwr models  only residuals of the mixed gwr model exhibit spatial independence  the prediction accuracy of the three models is respectively compared by means of the k fold cross validation method  results show that the mixed gwr model has higher prediction accuracy  while the other two models have roughly the same level of performance  we find that not all independent variables possess a spatially varying relationship with active mode volumes  the flexibility of the mixed gwr model that allows some independent variables to be global strengthens its prediction power  with these findings  transportation planners can dynamically estimate bicycle and pedestrian volumes at widespread intersections  and this geographical realism would facilitate local transportation planning  facility design  safety enhancement and operation analysis  as well as instilling new insights into interdisciplinary spatial research domain  
 specification and calibration of a microscopic model for pedestrian dynamic simulation at signalized intersections  a hybrid approach macroscopic pedestrian models for bidirectional flow analysis encounter limitations in describing microscopic dynamics at crosswalks  pedestrian behavior at crosswalks is typically characterized by the evasive effect with conflicting pedestrians and vehicles and the following effect with leading pedestrians  this study proposes a hybrid approach  i e   route search and social force based approach  for modeling of pedestrian movement at signalized crosswalks  the key influential factors  i e   leading pedestrians  conflict with opposite pedestrians  collision avoidance with vehicles  and compromise with traffic lights  are considered  aerial video data collected at one intersection in beijing  china were recorded and extracted  a new calibration approach based on a genetic algorithm is proposed that enables optimization of the relative error of pedestrian trajectory in two dimensions  i e   moving distance and angle  model validation is conducted by comparison with the observed trajectories in five typical cases of pedestrian crossing with or without conflict between pedestrians and vehicles  the characteristics of pedestrian flow  speed  acceleration  pedestrian vehicle conflict  and the lane formation phenomenon were compared with those from two competitive models  thus demonstrating the advantage of the proposed model   c  2017 elsevier ltd  all rights reserved  
 specification of regret based models of choice behaviour  formal analyses and experimental design based evidence travel behaviour analysis has recently witnessed a rapidly growing interest in regret based models of choice behaviour  two different model specifications have been introduced in the transportation literature  chorus et al   transportation research b 42  1 18  2008a  in  proceedings 87th annual meeting of the transportation research board  washington dc  2008b  specified regret as a  non  linear function of the difference between the best foregone choice alternative and the chosen alternative  later  as an approximation to the original specification  chorus  2010  suggested a logarithm function of utility differences between all choice alternatives  mainly for ease of estimation  this paper makes two contributions to this literature  first  formal analyses are conducted to identify the parameter space where the logarithmic specification becomes theoretically inferior to the original specification  second  an empirical stated choice study on the choice of shopping centre is conducted to empirically test which specification best describes stated choices  results suggest that for the collected data the original specification outperforms the new specification  implications of this finding for the application of regret based choice models in travel behaviour analysis are discussed  
 speed optimization over a path with heterogeneous arc costs the speed optimization problem over a path aims to find a set of speeds over each arc of the given path to minimize the total cost  while respecting the time window constraint at each node and speed limits over each arc  in maritime transportation  the cost represents fuel cost or air pollutant emissions  so study of this problem has significant economic and environmental impacts  to accommodate different fuel and emission models  we allow the dependence of the cost on the speed to be a general continuously differentiable and strictly convex function  and different across the arcs  we develop an efficient algorithm that is able to solve instances of 1000 nodes in less than a second  the algorithm is 20 to 100 times faster than a general convex optimization solver on test instances and requires much less memory  the solutions found at intermediate steps of our algorithm also provide some insights to ship planners on how to balance the operating cost and service quality   c  2017 elsevier ltd  all rights reserved  
 speed reductions and judgments of travel time loss  biases and debiasing priority decisions concerning maintenance or reconstruction of roads are made with the aim of road improvements with as little traffic disturbance and time loss as possible  however  it cannot be avoided that speed will be reduced and travel time increased during the time of construction  the present study shows how intuitive judgments of travel time losses are biased in a way similar to the times saving bias  svenson  2008   but not perfectly corresponding to that bias  this means that when speed is decreased from a slow speed  50 km h  the time loss is underestimated and when speed is decreased from a high speed  80 km h it is overestimated  also  drivers  politicians and policy makers who do not make exact calculations are likely victims of the time loss bias  the time loss bias was weakened but not eliminated by a debiasing instruction including mathematical computations of travel times  when driving speed restrictions are implemented  in particular on fast motorways  it is necessary to consider and counteract the time loss bias and inform the public  this can be done  for example  in communications about travel time facts  by information in driver training and by mounting temporary road signs informing about the average travel time prolongation due to a road work   c  2017 elsevier ltd  all rights reserved

 statistical inference based research on sampling time of vehicle driving cycle experiments a driving cycle is a speed time profile for a vehicle driving under a specified condition  it is usually developed from vehicle driving data collected by experiments to represent the real life diving patterns  because of lacking corresponding sampling theory  it is difficult for engineers to determine when vehicle driving cycle experiments should be stopped  in order to obtain sufficient experimental data  engineers normally choose to prolong the time of experiments wasting time and money  how to build a synthetical sampling subset of data representing a larger one becomes a main problem of sampling experiments  this paper  based on statistical inference theory  proposed a method to solve this problem at the city zone scale  first  the information entropy of road intersections was applied to determine the reasonable zone size  then  according to one month driving data of changchun taxis and one week driving data of beijing taxis  it was found that the traffic distribution in city zone were able to be described by nakagami distribution  it can pass the k s test under the 0 05 significance level  in the order to fully use driving data  the bootstrap method was employed to conduct three resampling experiments in changchun and five in beijing  after analyzing the confidence intervals of distribution parameters  this paper discovered that the quality of the sampling data could be indicated by the accuracy of each zone s per car per day per square kilometers travel times  the linear relationship between the expectation of zone travel times variable coefficient and the expectation of alpha ab  which was used to evaluate the similarity between sampling distribution and population distribution was discovered  this relationship was also proved in this paper theoretically  since the expectation of variable coefficient can be computed by sampling data  engineers are able to estimate the quality of these data in real time  if the alpha ab  reaches the preset threshold  experiments can be stopped   c  2017 elsevier ltd  all rights reserved  
 statistical modeling of the fuel flow rate of ga piston engine aircraft using flight operational data the united states has the largest and most diverse general aviation  ga  community in the world  with more than 220 000 aircraft  flying almost 23 million hours annually  accurate and economic estimating the exhaust emissions of general aviation will effectively support the practice of mitigating the environmental impacts from general aviation  fuel flow rate in each phase of the landing and takeoff cycle is one of the necessary factors recommended by the international civil aviation organization to be used to estimate the exhaust emissions  this paper explores statistical models of predicting the fuel flow rate of piston engine aircraft using general aviation flight operational data  including the aircraft altitude  the ground speed  and the vertical speed  a machine learning technique is applied to adapt the variability of flight operational data due to flexible operations of general aviation and random errors in flight data  the classification and regression trees  cart  and the smoothing spline anova  ss anova  are adopted as the modeling approaches  the modeling results are compared and interpreted from the standpoint of general aviation phases of flight in the landing and takeoff cycle  both models demonstrate good accuracy in predicting the fuel flow rate  the cart model provides intuitive outputs by the phases of flight  and is more robust to flight data outliers  the ss anova model is relatively more accurate in predicting the fuel flow rate  and is better at explaining the interaction between variables  a robust fuel flow rate prediction model of predicting the fuel flow rate of piston engine aircraft is believed to be practical and economic for ga exhaust emissions estimation   c  2017 elsevier ltd  all rights reserved  
 statistical modelling of runway incursion occurences in the united states runway incursions are an important aviation safety concern  between 2002 and 2015 there were 16 785 runway incursions at united states airports ranging in size from small general aviation  ga  to large commercial airline hubs  when examining airports with the 50 highest incursion count over the past 5 years  the predominant categories were large hubs  which accounted for 21 airports and general aviation  ga  airports which accounted for 16 airports  in june 2015  the federal aviation administration  faa  announced the runway incursion mitigation  rim  program to identify airport risk factors that might contribute to a runway incursion and develop strategies to help airport stakeholders mitigate those risks  different size airports serve different aircraft fleets  serve different operating volumes  and have different resources available  both funds and technologies  for incursion mitigation  therefore  it is valuable to determine the correlating factors that affect incursions at different size airports  this paper uses econometrics based modelling techniques to identify statistically significant factors in data provided by the  faa  public web sites on runway incursions  the model identified statistically significant variables that correlate with incursions  based on severity  for airports categories defined by the national plan of integrated airport systems  npias   the model results indicate that operational incidents  od are more likely at large hub airports  in contrast  at ga non hub airports  pilot deviations  pd  were significant for less severe incursions  severity c and d   only one variable   number of years since 2002   was found to be significant for all the three airport categories  this variable was correlated with severity a incursions and indicated a statistically significant reduction in severity a incursions  despite an overall 80  increase in incursions between 2002 and 2015   c  2017 elsevier ltd  all rights reserved  
 step tolling in an activity based bottleneck model this paper investigates the step tolling problem in an activity based bottleneck model in which activity scheduling utilities of commuters at home and at work vary by the time of day  the commuters choose their departure times from home to work in the morning to maximize their own scheduling utility  step tolling models with homogeneous and heterogeneous preferences are presented  the properties of the models and the optimal step toll schemes with constant and linear time varying marginal activity utilities are analytically explored and compared  it was found that for a given number of toll steps the efficacy of a step toll in terms of queuing removal rate is higher in the activity based bottleneck model with linear marginal utilities than in the conventional bottleneck model with constant marginal utilities  and ignoring the preference heterogeneity of commuters would underestimate the efficacy of a step toll   c  2017 elsevier ltd  all rights reserved  
 stochastic network link transmission model this article considers the stochastic modeling of vehicular network flows  including the analytical approximation of joint queue length distributions  the article presents two main methodological contributions  first  it proposes a tractable network model for finite space capacity markovian queueing networks  this methodology decomposes a general topology queueing network into a set of overlapping subnetworks and approximates the transient joint queue length distribution of each subnetwork  the subnetwork overlap allows to approximate stochastic dependencies across multiple subnetworks with a complexity that is linear in the number of subnetworks  additionally  the network model maintains mutually consistent overlapping subnetwork distributions  second  a stochastic network link transmission model  sltm  is formulated that builds on the proposed queueing network decomposition and on the stochastic single link model of osorio and flotterod  2015   the sltm represents each direction of a road and each road intersection as one queueing subnetwork  three experiments are presented  first  the analytical approximations of the queueing theoretical model are validated against simulation based estimates  an experiment with intricate traffic dynamics and multi modal joint distributions is studied  the analytical model captures most dependency structure and approximates well the simulated network dynamics and joint distributions  even for the considered simple network  which consists of only eight links  the proposed subnetwork decomposition yields significant gains in computational efficiency  it uses less than 0 0025  of the memory that is required by the use of a full network model  second and third  the proposed sltm is illustrated with a linear test network adopted from the literature and a more general topology network containing a diverge node and a merge node  time dependent probabilistic performance measures  occupancy uncertainty bands  spillback probabilities  are presented and discussed   c  2017 the authors  published by elsevier ltd  
 stochastic user equilibrium traffic assignment with equilibrated parking search routes in this paper we define and formulate the concept of parking search routes  psr  where a driver visits a sequence of parking locations until the first vacant parking spot is found and in doing so may account for  expected  parking probabilities  from there we define and formulate the stochastic user equilibrium  sue  traffic assignment in which no driver  by unilaterally changing its psr  can lower its perceived expected generalized costs  recognizing the interdependency between psr flows  travel times and parking probabilities  we propose a queuing model in order to compute endogenous parking probabilities accounting for these factors as well as maximum admissible search times  to solve the sue assignment with equilibrated psr we propose a solution algorithm  including a method for psr choice set generation  the model is implemented and applied both to a number of experimental cases to verify its properties and to a real life setting to illustrate its usefulness in parking related studies   c  2017 elsevier ltd  all rights reserved  
 strategic airline operation considering the carbon constrained air transport industry the eu emissions trading system  eu ets  is the eu s policy to combat climate change by reducing greenhouse gas emissions cost effectively  co2 emissions from aviation have been included in the eu ets since 2012  and all airlines operating in europe are required to report and submit allowances against those emissions  the eu ets is only applied to flights that begin or end in eu territory  therefore one of the options non eu based airlines use to deal with the eu ets requirements is aircraft reassignment or flight route adjustment  we investigate strategic airline operations that address the carbon constraints on the air transport industry  a mathematical model and algorithm are developed to derive efficient strategies for airline operations in terms of aircraft reassignment and route adjustment  the proposed mathematical model and heuristic algorithm are verified with a numerical example  the results of this study provide practitioners with insights when dealing with environmental restrictions on airlines   c  2017 elsevier ltd  all rights reserved  
 strategic entry to regional air cargo market under joint competition of demand and promised delivery time in air cargo industry  mainline carrying and regional carrying are complementary services that form an air cargo service supply chain  recently  many mainline carriers  mcs  have strategically entered upstream regional carrying service market to offer  one stop delivery  service and hence  competed with incumbent regional carriers  rcs   note that promised delivery time  pdt  competition is essential and common in this industry  we study a mc s entry decision using a joint demand and pdt competition model  we investigate the entry mode issue  fully controlled or joint venture   which influences the equilibrium profits and channel structure  and characterize the value of upstream competition and vertical cooperation between the mc and incumbent rc  interestingly  we find that the mc s upstream entry can result in a win win situation  or a lose lose situation for the mc and the incumbent rc  comparing parties  profits with and without pdt competition  we find that multi dimensional competition may weaken the negative effect of upstream entry on the incumbent rc  resulting in a price advantage and pdt disadvantage for the mc  we also find that a fully controlled entry mode is always a dominant strategy with or without pdt competition  moreover  by assuming power distribution of the pdt  we find that the increase in service rate can result in a lower price and shorter pdt quotation for the mc  a n  decrease  increase  of service rate strengthens  weakens  the pdt disadvantage  and this effect is strengthened with fully controlled entry mode  we also examine bertrand models and characterize the entry effects and the mc s entry decisions under joint price and pdt competition   c  2017 elsevier ltd  all rights reserved  
 street racing among the ontario adult population  prevalence and association with collision risks background  street racing has been identified as a significant public health concern  yet  little is known about the prevalence of this behaviour and its impact on collision risk  the current study was designed to address this dearth of knowledge by estimating the prevalence of street racing among the ontario  canada adult population  and examining its association to collision risk  controlling for demographics and other risk factors  methods  data were based on telephone interviews with 11 263 respondents derived from the 2009 2014 cycles of the camh monitor  an ongoing cross sectional survey of adults aged 18   years  a hierarchical entry binary logistic regression analysis of collision involvement in the previous 12 months was conducted and included measures of street racing  demographic characteristics  sex  age  marital status  education  income  region   driving exposure  and driving after use of alcohol and use of cannabis  results  the prevalence of street racing was 0 9   based on univariate analyses  street racing was more prevalent among males  1 30   p   01  and those aged 18 25 years  2 61   p   001   controlling for demographic characteristics  driving exposure  and driving after use of alcohol and use of cannabis  self reported street racing significantly increased the odds of a crash  or   5 23  p   001   discussion  a small but significant percentage of adult drivers in ontario reported engaging in street racing  even after adjusting for demographics  driving exposure  and driving after use of alcohol and use of cannabis  street racers faced more than a five fold increase in the odds of a crash  program and policy options must be considered to target this contingent  
 stress related psychosocial factors at work  fatigue  and risky driving behavior in bus rapid transport  brt  drivers introduction  there is consistent scientific evidence that professional drivers constitute an occupational group that is highly exposed to work related stressors  furthermore  several recent studies associate work stress and fatigue with unsafe and counterproductive work behaviors  this study examines the association between stress related work conditions of bus rapid transport  brt  drivers and risky driving behaviors  and examines whether fatigue is a mechanism that mediates the association between the two  method  a sample of 524 male bus rapid transit  brt  operators were drawn from four transport companies in bogota  colombia  the participants answered a survey which included an adapted version of the driver behavior questionnaire  dbq  for brt operators  as well as the effort reward imbalance and job content questionnaires  the subjective fatigue subscale of the checklist individual strength  cis  and the need for recovery after work scale  nfr   results  utilizing structural equation models  sem  it was found that risky driving behaviors in brt operators could be predicted through job strain  effort reward imbalance and social support at work  it was also found that fatigue and need for recovery fully mediate the associations between job strain and risky driving  and between social support and risky driving  but not the association between effort reward imbalance  eri  and risky driving  conclusions  the results of this study suggest that a  stress related working conditions  job strain  social support and eri  are relevant predictors of risky driving in brt operators  and b  that fatigue is the mechanism which links another kind of stress related to working conditions  job strain and low social support  with risky driving  the mechanism by which eri increases risky driving in brt operators remains unexplained  practical applications  this research suggests that in addition to the individual centered stress reduction occupational programs  fatigue management interventions aimed to changing some working conditions may reduce risky driving behaviors and promote safety in the professional drivers  jobs and on the road  
 studies for air traffic management r d in the asean region context we investigated flight delays and found that thunderstorms largely affected the flight delay duration  by performing monte carlo simulations  we also examined several scenarios to estimate the airport runway capacity  the results found might allow identifying crucial factors  meeting the rising air transport demand for more years ahead  in addition  a functioning modelling and simulation capability was established by the air traffic management research institute to carry out analyses of traffic flows and airspace structures throughout the asean region and to provide solutions for capacity and efficiency enhancements   c  2017 elsevier ltd  all rights reserved  
 sufficient optimality conditions for distributed  non predictive ramp metering in the monotonic cell transmission model we consider the ramp metering problem for a freeway stretch modeled by the cell transmission model  assuming perfect model knowledge and perfect traffic demand prediction  the ramp metering problem can be cast as a finite horizon optimal control problem with the objective of minimizing the total time spent  i e   the sum of the travel times of all drivers  for this reason  the application of model predictive control  mpc  to the ramp metering problem has been proposed  however  practical tests on freeways show that mpc may not outperform simple  distributed feedback policies  until now  a theoretical justification for this empirical observation was lacking  this work compares the performance of distributed  non predictive policies to the optimal solution in an idealised setting  specifically  for monotonic traffic dynamics and assuming perfect model knowledge  to do so  we suggest a distributed  non predictive policy and derive sufficient optimality conditions for the minimization of the total time spent via monotonicity arguments  in a case study based on real world traffic data  we demonstrate that these optimality conditions are only rarely violated  moreover  we observe that the suboptimality resulting from such infrequent violations appears to be negligible  we complement this analysis with simulations in non ideal settings  in particular allowing for model mismatch  and argue that alinea  a successful  distributed ramp metering policy  comes close to the ideal controller both in terms of control behavior and in performance   c  2017 elsevier ltd  all rights reserved  
 sugarcane harvest logistics in brazil sugar mills in brazil represent significant capital investments  to maintain appropriate returns on their investment  sugar companies seek to run the mills at capacity over the entire nine months of the sugarcane harvest season  because the sugar content of cane degrades considerably once it is cut  maintaining inventories of cut cane is undesirable  instead  mills want to coordinate the arrival of cut cane with production  in this paper  we present a model of the sugarcane harvest logistics problem in brazil  we introduce a series of valid inequalities for the model  and we introduce heuristics for finding an initial feasible solution and for lifting the lower bound  computational results demonstrate the effectiveness of the inequalities and heuristics  in addition  we explore the value of allowing trucks to serve multiple rather than single locations and demonstrate the value of allowing the harvest speed to vary  
 supply chain coordination with a single supplier and multiple retailers considering customer arrival times and route selection we address a novel decentralized supply chain with one supplier and multiple independent retailers based on the practice of several supply chains in the real world  coordination of such a supply chain has rarely been studied  despite overcoming the well known double marginalization  the supplier s route selection can obstruct supply chain coordination  we present a wholesale price and carpooling contract to coordinate such a supply chain  we demonstrate supply chain coordination under such a contract and show that the profit along the supply chain can be arbitrarily allocated  we show that the popular revenue sharing contract may lose flexibility in profit allocations   c  2017 elsevier ltd  all rights reserved

 sustainability evaluation framework for pavement technologies  an integrated life cycle economic and environmental trade off analysis sustainability evaluation of pavement alternatives for given traffic loading and environmental conditions has always been a challenging task for pavement designers and managers  pavement engineers and managers mainly use life cycle cost analysis  lcca  to make a decision while the recent focus of academic research and regulatory agencies was more on the life cycle assessment  lca  to evaluate the environmental impacts of different pavement alternatives  lcca and lca for more recent technologies  such as geosynthetics  have been relatively less addressed so far  moreover  uncertainties due to inadequate data can also reduce effectiveness of the decision making process during the planning phase  in this research  an integrated lcca and lca framework is developed for sustainability evaluation of different pavement alternatives based on an integrated economic and environmental trade off analysis  the framework can effectively evaluate different pavement technologies  including flexible  concrete  geosynthetics  and their combinations under different subgrade characteristics and traffic conditions  the fuzzy composite programming  fcp  is used   i  to deal with the uncertainties associated with limited data and vagueness in experienced judgment   ii  to integrate the results obtained from lcca and lca  and  iii  for final ranking of pavement alternatives  for final selection  decision makers can trade off between cost and environmental impacts over the life cycle of the pavement alternative  the study results indicate that geosynthetics can be used to enhance the pavement service life for low volume roads with optimized cost and minimum environmental impacts   c  2017 elsevier ltd  all rights reserved  
 sustainable decision making for joint distribution center location choice implementing joint distribution between express service providers is important in order to achieve operational efficiency and reduce operational cost  joint distribution centers  jdcs  are an important part of the modern urban logistics system for online shopping  and selecting the location for a jdc has become a key problem for stakeholders considering sustain ability  in this paper  we present a new hybrid fuzzy multiple criteria decision making method for selecting the location of a jdc considering sustainability  first  we identify the evaluation criteria for location selection integrating the economic  environmental  and social dimensions of sustainability  secondly  a fuzzy set is used to translate linguistic preferences into triangular fuzzy numbers  subjective criteria weights are calculated by combining the decision makers  superiority linguistic ratings with a fuzzy ahp method  objective criteria weights are determined by combining superiority linguistic ratings with a fuzzy entropy method  then  improved fuzzy topsis is achieved by using weighted criterion distances to rank these alternatives  this permits a more stable ranking order to be obtained compared to traditional fuzzy topsis which uses euclidean distance  finally  an empirical location selection and sensitivity analysis study is conducted to illustrate the effectiveness and robustness of the proposed method  this new method allows the location of a jdc to be selected considering sustainability  and will contribute to promoting the sustainable development of china s express industry and  to some extent  the sustainability and harmony of city development   c  2017 elsevier ltd  all rights reserved  
 sustainable transportation pros  cons  and self efficacy as predictors of 6 month stage transitions in a chinese sample sustainable transportation  st  refers to any form of commuting other than single occupancy vehicle usage  this study prospectively examined the pros  cons  and self efficacy for st as predictors of stage transitions over a period of 6 months  participants included 656 chinese college students and workers  they completed a translated questionnaire on their st stage  from precontemplation to maintenance   pros  cons  and self efficacy  six months later  the participants completed another questionnaire on their stage of change  the data on the participants in the pre action and post action stages were combined to predict forward transitions out of the pre action stages and backward transitions from the post action stages  logistic regression analyses were conducted predicting 6 month stage transitions  either forward or backward  using baseline stage  pros  cons  and self efficacy  higher st pros and  unexpectedly  lower st self efficacy predicted forward stage transitions among baseline participants who were not using st  in contrast  lower st pros and higher st cons predicted backward stage transitions  regression  among those who at baseline were using st  this study provides a preliminary understanding of predictive mechanisms of stage transitions for st

 systematic relation of estimated travel speed and actual travel speed estimated travel speed based on spot speed measurements from detectors has been used as a proxy to actual travel speed  recently  actual travel speeds become available as vehicles with onboard electronic devices provide actual section travel times  as a result  two different speeds can be estimated for a freeway section at a time interval  estimated travel speed takes the average of the spot speeds collected from each detector within a section at a time interval  and actual travel speed is estimated using the sampled vehicles  actual journey speeds over the section  this paper compares the difference between estimated and actual travel speeds using both kinematic wave theory and actual observations for different traffic states  the theoretical analysis proves that there is a systematic relationship between the estimated and actual travel speeds that form a well defined loop shape  the existence of well defined relations is verified using real traffic speed data collected from a korean expressway and a california freeway  empirical analysis shows that the real data of estimated versus actual travel speeds exhibit a well defined linear relationship rather than loop shape  the analysis also shows that the estimated travel speed is generally greater than the actual travel speed due not only to the systematic difference between estimated and actual travel speeds but also to the inherent characteristics of speed data from loop detectors  this finding provides a groundwork to calibrate the widely used estimated travel speed by exploiting the actual travel speeds that were provided by a subset of vehicles in traffic  
 take over performance in evasive manoeuvres we investigated after effects of automation in take over scenarios in a high end moving base driving simulator  drivers performed evasive manoeuvres encountering a blocked lane in highway driving  we compared the performance of drivers 1  during manual driving  2  after automated driving with eyes on the road while performing the cognitively demanding n back task  and 3  after automated driving with eyes off the road performing the visually demanding surt task  both minimum time to collision  ttc  and minimum clearance towards the obstacle disclosed a substantial number of near miss events and are regarded as valuable surrogate safety metrics in evasive manoeuvres  ttc proved highly sensitive to the applied definition of colliding paths  and we prefer robust solutions using lane position while disregarding heading  the extended time to collision  ettc  which takes into account acceleration was close to the more robust conventional ttc  in line with other publications  the initial steering or braking intervention was delayed after using automation compared to manual driving  this resulted in lower ttc values and stronger steering and braking actions  using automation  effects of cognitive distraction were similar to visual distraction for the intervention time with effects on the surrogate safety metric ttc being larger with visual distraction  however the precision of the evasive manoeuvres was hardly affected with a similar clearance towards the obstacle  similar overshoots and similar excursions to the hard shoulder  further research is needed to validate and complement the current simulator based results with human behaviour in real world driving conditions  experiments with real vehicles can disclose possible systematic differences in behaviour  and naturalistic data can serve to validate surrogate safety measures like ttc and obstacle clearance in evasive manoeuvres  
 target detection distances under different road lighting intensities purpose road lighting illuminates road surface and surrounding areas of objects on a road  while car headlights illuminate vertical objects on a road  the goal of the study was to investigate the interaction between road lighting and car headlights at target detection distance  method target detection distances under different road lighting intensities and car headlights were studied with and without glare from an oncoming car  dimmable high pressure sodium lamps with three lighting levels 49  71 and 100   3557  5179 and 7252 lm  were used  test drivers had to detect a small uniform standard target standing vertically on the straight road  results in the absence of glare  low beam car headlights   road lighting intensity levels of 100 and 49  provided comparable detection distances  while at 71  of road lighting intensity visibility was the lowest  the target was seen in negative or positive contrast in 100  of road lighting  in 71  of road lighting  the target was detected in positive contrast  while  in 49  of road lighting target was seen in negative contrast  there was a significant difference in detection distances under different road lighting intensities when there was no glare from the oncoming car  the significance main effect was between 49 and 71  of road lighting intensities  in addition  no significant differences in the effect of road lighting intensities could be found under glare from the oncoming car  in the presence of glare from the oncoming car  targets were always in negative contrast  both road lighting and car headlights are associated with detection distances  conclusion the results of these experiments can give new insight to the development of intelligent road lighting considering the combined effect of road lighting and car headlights  the results provide useful insight to dim the lighting in order to save energy without impairing the detection of objects

 taxi market equilibrium with third party hailing service with the development and deployment of new technologies  the oligopolistic taxi industry is transforming into a shared market with coexistence of both traditional taxi service  tts  and app based third party taxi service  atts   the atts is different from its in both entry policy and fare setting  and brings competition into the market  to account for the revolution of the taxi industry  in this study  we analyze the characteristics of the tts and atts  model the taxi market as a multiple leader follower game at the network level  and investigate the equilibrium of taxi market with competition  tmc equilibrium   in particular  passengers are modeled as the leaders who seek to minimize their travel cost associated with taxi rides  followers involve tts and nits drivers  who compete for passengers to maximize their revenue  the network model captures selfish behavior of passengers and drivers in the taxi market  and we prove the existence of tmc equilibrium for the proposed model using variational inequality formulations  an iterative algorithm is further developed to find the tmc equilibrium  which corresponds to the strongly stationary point of the multi leader follower game  based on numerical results  it is observed that fleet size and pricing policy are closely associated with the level of competition in the market and may have significant impact on total passengers cost  average waiting time  and fleet utilization   c  2017 elsevier ltd  all rights reserved  
 technical and financial efficiency of brazilian container terminals container terminals play a central role in the global distribution of goods  as essential elements in most supply chains  container handling in brazilian terminals has been growing in the past five years  so  given the importance of container handling activity for brazilian economy  it is relevant to study how the resources are used and also the efficiency of these terminals  this paper evaluates the technical and financial efficiencies of brazilian container terminals  initially  bibliographic research was done to understand the handling activities of container terminals  the financial and technical efficiency concepts and the variables related to them  after that  the data were gathered based in reports by port authorities and the technical and financial efficiency were calculated for brazilian public container terminals  tecon santos  convicon  tecondi  rodrimar  libra rio  sepetiba tecon  tecon rio grande and tecon salvador were selected for this study due to the data availability  at the end  we established the technical and financial efficiency rankings enabling comparison of these two types of efficiency for each terminal  besides this  the terminals  breakeven points were calculated  the data indicate that the terminals with best technical efficiency are not necessarily those with best financial efficiency and vice versa  this paper is relevant since it allows identifying terminals  weaknesses  making it possible to develop actions to improve their performance  besides that  it helps decision makers to manage future investments and improvement actions

 temporal dynamics in local vehicle ownership for great britain this article explores the stability of local vehicle ownership rates in great britain using the technique of spatial markov chain analysis  non spatial markov chain processes describe the transition of neighbourhoods through levels of ownership with no regard to their neighbourhood context  in reality however  how a neighbourhood transitions to different levels of ownership could be influenced by its neighbourhood context  a spatial markov chain accounts for this context by estimating transition properties that are conditioned on the surrounding neighbourhood  these spatial markov chain properties are estimated using a long run census time series from 1971 to 2011 of household vehicle ownership rates in great britain  these processes show that there is different behaviour in how neighbourhoods transition between levels of ownership depending on the context of their surrounding neighbours  the general finding is that the spatial markov process will lead to a greater homogeneity in levels of ownership in each locality  with neighbourhoods surrounded by relatively low ownership neighbourhoods taking longer than a non spatial markov process would suggest to transition to higher levels  whilst neighbourhoods of high ownership surrounded by high ownership neighbourhoods take longer to transition to lower levels  this work corroborates tobler s first law of geography  everything is related to everything else  but near things are more related than distant things  but also provides practical guidance  firstly  in modelling ownership  spatial effects need to be tested and when present  accounted for in the model formulation  secondly  in a policy context  the surrounding neighbourhood situation is important  with neighbourhoods having a tendency towards homogeneity of ownership levels  this allows for the effective planning of transport provision for local services  thirdly  vehicle ownership is often used as a proxy for the social and aspirational nature of an area and these results suggest that these properties will persist for a prolonged period  possibly perpetuating and exacerbating differentials in society  
 temporal transferability  trade off between data newness and the number of observations for forecasting travel demand recent and large amounts of data are crucial for forecasting travel demand  however  in some cases  an older time point may have more data than a more recent time point  a trade off between older data with a large number of observations and recent data with a smaller number of observations has not been investigated in the context of temporal transferability  in this paper  this trade off is examined in the context of journey to work mode choice behaviours by utilising repeated cross sectional data collected in nagoya  japan  models estimated utilising different numbers of observations  ranging from 50 to 10 000  obtained at different time points  1971  1981  and 1991  are applied to the forecasting of behaviours for 2001  bootstrapping provides insights with statistical meaning  one finding is that the minimum number of observations from a recent time point that is required to produce a forecast statistically significantly better than that produced by older data with a larger number of observations is surprisingly stable  even when the number of observations from the older time point varies considerably  for example  300 500 stable observations from 1981 produced forecasts that were statistically significantly better than that produced by 500 10 000 wide ranging observations from 1971  analysing the trade off can help determine an efficient survey interval and sample size in an era of declining budgets for travel surveys  
 temporary jobs and the severity of workplace accidents introduction  from the point of view of workplace safety  it is important to know whether having a temporary job has an effect on the severity of workplace accidents  we present an empirical analysis on the severity of workplace accidents by type of contract  method  we used microdata collected by the italian national institute managing the mandatory insurance against work related accidents  we estimated linear models for a measure of the severity of the workplace accident  we controlled for time invariant fixed effects at worker and firm levels to disentangle the impact of the type of contract from the spurious one induced by unobservables at worker and firm levels  results  workers with a temporary contract  if subject to a workplace accident  were more likely to be confronted with severe injuries than permanent workers  when correcting the statistical analysis for injury under reporting of temporary workers  we found that most of  but not all  the effect is driven by the under reporting bias  conclusions  the effect of temporary contracts on the injury severity survived the inclusion of worker and firm fixed effects and the correction for temporary workers  injury under reporting  this  however  does not exclude the possibility that  within firms  the nature of the work may vary between different categories of workers  for example  temporary workers might be more likely to be assigned dangerous tasks because they might have less bargaining power  practical implications  the findings will help in designing public policy effective in increasing temporary workers  safety at work and limiting their injury under reporting   c  2017 published by elsevier ltd  on behalf of national safety council  
 test retest reliability and convergent validity of measures of children s travel behaviours and independent mobility introduction  active transportation  at  and independent mobility  im  represent promising avenues for increasing children s physical activity and minimizing car use  however  there are limited data on the psychometric properties of measures of at and im  methods  94 child and parent dyads living in ottawa  canada  consented to complete a questionnaire twice  approximately two weeks apart  in english or french language  they were questioned on children s travel to from places  e g   school  parks  shops  and on the extent of the child s im  the weekly volume of at to from school was calculated by multiplying the number of active trips by the home school distance  an im index consisting of six  mobility licenses   to travel home from school  travel to other places within walking distance  cross main roads  cycle on main roads  go out after dark  and travel on local buses without adult supervision  was computed  test retest reliability and convergent validity between children and parents were assessed with cohen s kappa or infra class correlation coefficients  icc   results  the volume of at to from school showed high test retest reliability and convergent validity in both languages  icc range   0 81 0 97   similarly  test retest reliability was also high for the number of active trips to from all destinations  icc range   0 60 0 94  and the im index  icc range   0 63 0 88   convergent validity for trips to from all destinations was fair in the english language subsample  icc range   0 22 0 25   but substantial in the french language subsample  icc range   0 60 0 82   the im index showed substantial validity at both test and retest and in both languages  icc range   0 61 0 80   coefficients were generally lower when examining single destinations or mobility licenses  conclusion  with minor modifications  the child and parent mobility questionnaires can provide valid and reliable estimates of at to from a broad range of destinations and im among english and french speaking grade 4 6 children  
 testing the proportionality condition with taxi trajectory data the proportionality condition has been widely used to produce a unique path flow solution in the user equilibrium traffic assignment problem  however  it remains an open question whether and to what extent this condition accords to real travel behavior  this paper attempts to validate the behavioural realism of the proportionality condition using more than 27 million route choice observations obtained by mining a large taxi trajectory data set  a method is first developed to uncover more than three hundred valid paired alternative segments  pas   on which the proportionality condition is tested by performing linear regression analysis and chi square tests  the results show that the majority of the pass tested  up to 85   satisfy the proportionality condition at a reasonable level of statistical significance   c  2017 elsevier ltd  all rights reserved  
 testing the slope model of scheduling preferences on stated preference data the valuation of travel time variability is derived either from a structural model  given information on departure time  or directly from a reduced form model where departure time is assumed to be optimally chosen  the two models are theoretically equivalent under certain assumptions  hence are expected to yield similar results  we use stated preference data to compare the valuation of travel time variability under a structural model where trip timing preferences are defined in terms of time dependent utility rates  the  slope model   against its reduced form model  two choice experiments are used that are identical except one has a fixed departure time while the other allows respondents to choose departure time freely  the empirical results in this paper do not support the theoretical equivalence of the two models as the implied value of travel time variability under the reduced form model is an order of magnitude larger  this finding  which is robust to various specification tests  is in line with a recent swedish study by borjesson  eliasson and franklin  transportation research part b  methodological  46 7   855 873  2012    since our data allows a direct comparison of the two approaches  we are able to rule out some potential explanations lined up by past research for the observed discrepancy between the two models   c  2017 elsevier ltd  all rights reserved  
 testing the stability of utility parameters in repeated best  repeated best worst and one off best worst studies stated choice  sc  surveys are a key tool for studying travel behaviour and are used to inform policy decisions in many countries  recently  the best worst  bw  variant of sc has rapidly increased in popularity in fields as diverse as transport  marketing and health research  a key argument for its implementation has been that it is perceived to be easier for respondents to identify the best and the worst alternative in a choice set compared to identifying the second or even third best  for elicitation formats asking respondents to consecutively identify the first  second and third best  etc   alternative  labelled here as repeated best stages  it is well known that utility and scale parameters are generally not stable across the stages  joint analysis of the responses to each stage may increase the efficiency of the utility and willingness to pay parameters  i e  smaller standard errors   but incorrect inferences may be made if these parameters are not stable across the stages  this paper tests the stability of utility parameters for the repeated bw and one off bw format  using data from three different studies  we show that  regardless of the dataset and elicitation format used  the obtained utility parameters and willingness to pay estimates are not stable across stages  the results thereby question the use of bw data in applied work aimed at forecasting and understanding first  best  choices  our findings thereby contradict recent discussions about potentially beneficial framing effects in bw surveys  the unique presence of corresponding data from a repeated best and repeated bw exercise in one survey highlights the observed rank orders are highly consistent across the two elicitation formats and that any differences in marginal willingness to pay estimates can be attributed to the imposed econometric model rather than to differences in the behaviour of respondents  
 texting while driving  executive function  and impulsivity in college students the purpose of the present study was to investigate the cognitive processes underlying texting while driving  a sample of 120 college students completed a survey to assess how frequently they send and read a text message while driving  based on this information  students were assigned to one of two groups  20 students who frequently text while driving and 20 matched control students who infrequently text while driving but were similar in gender  age  years of education  and years driving  the groups were compared on the extent to which they differed in self reported measures of executive function and impulsivity  the groups were also compared on a behavioral measure of impulsivity  the extent to which they discounted hypothetical monetary rewards as a function of the delay  for this measure  the students made repeated choices between smaller monetary rewards available immediately and larger rewards available after delays ranging from 1 week to 6 months  the results show that the group of students who frequently text while driving showed  a  significantly lower levels of executive function and  b  higher levels of self reported impulsivity  although the groups did not differ significantly on the behavioral measure of impulsivity  these results support a general conclusion that drivers with lower levels of executive function and higher levels of impulsivity are more likely to text while driving   c  2017 elsevier ltd  all rights reserved

 the accuracy of toll road traffic forecasts  an econometric evaluation this study assesses the accuracy of toll road traffic forecasts in norway  this study contributes to extant literature regarding transportation economics and policy because few studies have analyzed the accuracy of toll road traffic forecasts and current studies on this topic do not use a succinct econometric framework to infer the forecast s bias and efficiency  which are determinants of the accuracy of forecasts  the data for this study include 68 toll road projects where forecasts and actual out turns were available  all projects that are included in this study were opened for traffic during 1975 2014  transport models were made mandatory for forecasting toll traffic in 2006  the results of this study reveal the following   i  norwegian toll road traffic forecasts are underestimated but are close to accurate because the mean percentage error is a mere 4   this result sharply contrasts international studies that resulted in large overestimations at more than  20    ii  the accuracy of forecasts has not improved since transport models became mandatory   iii  the norwegian toll road traffic forecasts are unbiased  which implies that they do not tend to be one sided   iv  norwegian forecasts are efficient  which implies that available information is used adequately when making forecasts  our conclusion is that the toll traffic forecasts in norway perform fairly well compared to the forecasts of other countries  in addition  we recommend that the assessment of forecasts in the transportation sector should be based on succinct econometric frameworks  otherwise  the conclusions may lack important information regarding the bias and efficiency of the forecasts   c  2017 elsevier ltd  all rights reserved

 the attitudes of uk tourists to the use of biofuels in civil aviation  an exploratory study tourism generates substantial carbon footprint with its air transport sector holding the largest share  biofuel technology has been repeatedly trialled in aviation to minimise this carbon footprint  while biofuels can become mainstream aviation fuels in the near future  little is known about public knowledge on and perception of its use within the air transport sector  this signifies considerable knowledge gap as the level of public awareness of a new technology determines the speed of its societal acceptance and may affect its market success  this study explores the attitudes of uk tourists to the use of biofuels in aviation  it finds that while the public are generally aware of biofuel technology  public knowledge of its specific application in aviation alongside the carbon benefits this brings is limited  future policy making and managerial measures should aim at enhancing public understanding of biofuel technology use in aviation in the uk   c  2017 elsevier ltd  all rights reserved  
 the best way to assess visually induced motion sickness in a fixed base driving simulator objective  driving simulator usage is becoming more widespread  yet many users still experience substantial motion sickness like symptoms induced by optical flow  called visually induced motion sickness  vims   the fast motion sickness scale  fms  allows for continuous on line assessment of vims  using mixed models for ordinal data  this study investigated how to optimally analyze fms data  and then used the resulting models to examine the development of symptoms over time in detail  additionally  the study explored the impact of specific vims inducing road elements  methods  twenty eight healthy young adults without prior simulator experience completed six courses on two days in a fixed base driving simulator  vims severity was reported every minute using the fms  each course included two road elements designed to induce vims  the data was analyzed using cumulative link mixed models  results  the fms data deviated clearly from a normal distribution  treating fms data as ordinal led to preferable models compared to models assuming interval scale  vims increased within each drive and over consecutive courses  but decreased between two days separated by a week  adaptation   adaptation was attributable to less pronounced symptom increases on the second day  both within each course and between consecutive drives  vims increases within each drive were less pronounced during later courses of each day  habituation   participants differed both in general symptom levels and in their progressions of vims over time  additionally  vims inducing road segments could be identified as leading to higher probabilities of symptom increases  conclusion  mixed models analyses of fms data from repeated vims measurements can benefit from taking deviations from normal distribution and interval scale into account  the gained insights into habituation and adaptation processes  as well as into the impact of specific road elements  can help in planning and conducting future driving simulator experiments   c  2017 published by elsevier ltd  
 the built environment and travel behavior in urban china  a literature review interests in studying of the built environment impacts on travel behavior have proliferated from north america to other parts of the world including china  until very recently  there has been very little research into travel behavior in china  however  during the last decade  there has been a fast growing interest in studying the built environment and travel behavior in chinese cities  perhaps motivated by china s unprecedented urbanization and rapid urban transport development  case studies from china provide new insights into the impacts of built environment on travel behavior that can help to enrich existing scholarship  however  currently there is a generally poor understanding of the role played by chinese research and how it has enriched the international literature  this paper aims to fill this gap by reviewing studies in and outside china by both chinese and non chinese scholars  the focus is on the contribution of these studies to the international literature  we identify four areas of contribution  how the built environment has been developed and its implications for travel behavior  the importance of housing sources in defining residential built environment and explaining travel behavior  the unique danwei  or work unit  perspective on jobs housing relationships and commuting behavior  and the importance of neighborhood types in explaining travel behavior in chinese cities  the findings from this review should be relevant for researchers interested in developing future studies that will further advance geographic knowledge of the built environment and travel behavior  specifically in china and with broader global contexts   c  2016 elsevier ltd  all rights reserved  
 the built environment determinants of activity participation and walking near the workplace investigating the built environment determinants of commuting behaviors to and from the workplace has long been of interest to travel behavior researchers  specific attention has centered on examination of how smart growth policies encourage both trip chaining and active travel  yet  limited research has investigated the impact of the built environment on activity participation and pedestrian travel once the worker has arrived at his her workplace  a research omission that exists despite the prospect that built environment densification and diversification within employment districts may encounter less opposition from the local community and commuter  our study investigates these identified gaps by analyzing how the built environment near an individual s workplace as well as personal  household  and tour related attributes relate to work based sub tour activity participation and walking for activity fulfillment  a bivariate selection model estimated the workplace built environment determinants of work based sub tour participation and the likelihood to initiate travel for these sub tour activities on foot  findings from this portland  oregon study revealed that design and diversity features predicted work based sub tour participation  while  the decision to walk to start a sub tour was strongly associated with a workplace built environment characterized by a traditional neighborhood design and increased residential density  
 the carbon savings and health co benefits from the introduction of mass rapid transit system in greater kuala lumpur  malaysia introduction  transportation is a convenient way to incorporate an active lifestyle  in addition to reducing environmental pollution  this study estimates the changes in carbon dioxide  co2  emissions and the health co benefits from two new mass rapid transit  mrt  lines in greater kuala lumpur  malaysia  method  changes in co2 and air pollutant emissions were estimated from motor vehicle activity based on the travel information collected from a survey  health effects were estimated using a comparative health risk assessment method  exposure to air pollution was modelled based on the reduction in ambient pm2 5 concentration  traffic injury was estimated using a constant risk per distance for each transport mode  physical activity was modelled based on the amount of walking to or from the stations  health outcomes were calculated as changes in premature deaths and disability adjusted life years  dalys   results  the two mrt lines would reduce 337 800 t of co2 equivalent per year from private transportation  however  the use of motor vehicle in the station access egress would offset 28  of the total carbon savings  the ambient pm2 5 concentration would be reduced by 0 12 g m 3   preventing 5 deaths and 104 dalys per year  reduced traffic injuries would prevent 88 deaths and 6300 dalys per year  while increased walking would prevent 90 deaths and 3200 dalys per year  sensitivity analysis revealed that travel distance  modal shift and station access egress distance could considerably change co2 emission reduction  while relative risks of physical activity could significantly affect attributable burden of diseases  conclusion  the two mrt lines would reduce 6  of co2 equivalent emission from private motor vehicles in greater kuala lumpur and bring important health co benefits to the population  however  strategic planning around the mrt stations for access and egress is necessary to achieve maximal benefits  
 the co contraction index of the upper limb for young and old adult cyclists bicycling is a popular and convenient means of transportation amongst the elderly in the netherlands  however  the uptake of the electric bicycle resulted in an increase of single sided bicycle accidents amongst the elderly  veiligheid  2010   since elderly are prone to severe injuries  bicycle stability is currently a popular research topic  three main balance strategies have been proposed in former studies  steering as the primary balance strategy and trunk and lateral knee movement as secondary balance strategies  moore et al   2011  cain  2013   since steering is the primary strategy for bicycle stability  the stiffness of the arms plays an important role in active stability during cycling  it has been shown that the arm stiffness of a passive rider is an important factor on the stability of a bicycle  doria and tognazzo  2014   in the study presented here  the co contraction index  cci  of the upper limb for young and old adult cyclist is studied  data is collected during experiments based on the setup described in  kiewiet et al   2014   wherein contact forces  muscle activities and motions of the rider and bicycle are measured for 15 young adult  mean     sd  253     2 8 yrs  and 15 old adult  mean     sd  58 1     2 1 yrs  subjects during unperturbed and perturbed cycling  the arm stiffness is defined as a co contraction ratio between muscle activity of the m  biceps brachii and m  triceps lateralis  results suggest that older adult cyclists use more co contraction of their arm muscles during cycling  compared to young cyclists  the inter subject variability of the found cci was higher for the old adult subject group  compared to the young group  the results support the initial hypothesis that the increase in co contraction of the upper limb for older cyclists is higher during perturbed cycling compared to unperturbed cycling than for younger cyclists  the findings might give direction towards solutions for increasing the safety and stability for elderly cyclists   c  2016 elsevier ltd  all rights reserved  
 the combined effects of driver attitudes and in vehicle feedback on fuel economy this paper presents results from a study of driver feedback  driver attitudes  and the adoption of ecodriving behaviors  the study ran for one year  each driver was engaged in the experiment for four weeks  narrowly defined  ecodriving represents the set of behaviors that a driver can use to minimize the energy use of a trip after the trip has begun  the general ecodriving behaviors are moderating acceleration  top speed  and braking  ecodriving has long been recognized as a potential source of reductions in transportation energy use  with reduction estimates ranging widely from less than 5  to over 20  depending on context  in vehicle feedback that provides drivers with salient information suited to their personal goals may be one way to motivate ecodriving  although many studies have tested unique feedback designs  little research has been conducted into the cognitive precursors to driver behavior change that may underlie the adoption or rejection of ecodriving practices  and therefore underlie the effectiveness of any feedback design  this study examines both precursor cognitive factors and driver behavior changes with the introduction of energy feedback  using a framework hypothesizing that attitudes  social norms  perceived control  and goals influence behavior and behavior change  the study finds that the introduction of a feedback interface can both activate these cognitive factors and result in behavior change  furthermore  the study finds that there was an overall 4 4  reduction in fuel consumption due entirely to one group that showed increases in their knowledge of fuel economy and reported high levels of technical proficiency during the experiment  statistically significant relationships are found in this group between the magnitude of cognitive change and the magnitude of behavior change supporting the theoretical framework  the second group made no improvement and may have been confused by the feedback  the effect of baseline  pre feedback  performance of the drivers indicates drivers that already have highly efficient driving styles do not benefit much from feedback   c  2017 elsevier ltd  all rights reserved  
 the complexity of planning for goods delivery in a shared urban space  a case study involving cyclists and trucks introduction growth in urban areas has resulted in conflicts between road users as they share the roadway  such conflicts are only exacerbated by failings in the planning process  the purpose of this study is to examine  through a case study in trondheim  norway  issues related to freight delivery on a street section with a high volume of cyclists in order to identify how and where urban freight should be addressed within the urban planning process  methods the study consists of two parts   1  a safety evaluation of the location through video recordings which identifies the risk areas associated with freight delivery and encounters with cyclists  and  2  a mapping of the planning process through semi structured interviews in order to understand the development decisions involving a facility requiring deliveries and the surrounding streetscape  results the safety analysis identified several risk areas mainly associated with the turning manoeuvres of trucks undertaken either before or after deliveries  the mapping of the planning process indicated that there were few to no discussions of freight deliveries during the planning  design and construction of the building  neither were there any for the streetscape projects taking place within the same time frame  conclusions the absence of a dedicated freight policy and or personnel at the governing authority  as well as lack of coordination amongst different plans  construction  street  thematic   are likely to lead to continued problematic and potentially dangerous environments such as that in the case study  improvements to the norwegian planning process  namely earlier integration of freight considerations  are required to ensure sustainable freight systems in the urban environment

 the cost to carshare  a review of the changing prices and taxation levels for carsharing in the united states 2011 2016 this study explores the changing prices and level of taxation for carsharing in the united states through a review of hourly rates in 80 cities with zipcar pods  as well as at u s  locations served by car2go and maven  the base rate for a one hour zipcar carshare between 2011 and 2016 is shown to have fallen from  9 39 to  8 92  a 5 0  drop  in inflation adjusted terms  this constitutes an 11 2  real reduction  retail taxes over the period  however  rose from 15 5  to 17 0   offsetting almost one third of the price reduction  in some cities  taxes on one hour reservations exceed 30  due to transaction based fees that apply regardless of the duration of the trip  interpreted broadly  these results indicate that carsharing is becoming more affordable to urban consumers  while being subject to extensive competition and facing the burden of extensive retail taxes that may hamper efforts to achieve local sustainability goals  
 the cumulative capacitated vehicle routing problem with min sum and min max objectives  an effective hybridisation of adaptive variable neighbourhood search and large neighbourhood search the cumulative capacitated vehicle routing problem  ccvrp  is a relatively new variant of the classical capacitated vehicle routing problem in which the objective is to minimise the sum of arrival times at customers  min sum  instead of the total route distance  while the literature for the ccvrp is scarce  this problem has useful applications especially in the area of supplying humanitarian aid after a natural disaster  in this paper  a two stage adaptive variable neighbourhood search  avns  algorithm that incorporates large neighbourhood search  lns  as a diversification strategy is proposed  when tested on the benchmark data sets  the results show that the proposed avns is highly competitive in producing new best known solutions to more than half of the instances  an alternative but related objective that minimises the maximum arrival time  min max  is also explored in this study demonstrating the flexibility and the effectiveness of the proposed metaheuristic  to the best of our knowledge  this is the first study that exploits the min max objective of the ccvrp in addition to providing extensive computational results for a large number of instances for the min sum  as a by product of this study  managerial insights for decision making are also presented   c  2017 elsevier ltd  all rights reserved  
 the decentralized field service routing problem companies that provide service at geographically dispersed locations face the problem of determining the technician that will serve each location as well as setting the best route for each technician  such a scenario is known as the field service routing problem  large companies often outsource their field service tasks to several contractors  each contractor may serve several companies  since the contractors cannot share the information about the tasks of their other clients  the most common practice involves allocating the tasks to the contractors heuristically based on geographical considerations  in this approach  the tasks for which the contractors have already been committed to other companies are not considered  as a result  the allocation of new tasks can be inefficient  this study develops 2 stage task allocation mechanisms that cope with the problem and result in nearly optimal allocations  in the first stage  a feasible allocation of tasks to contractors is generated  we consider two possible allocation procedures  sequential combinatorial auctions and sequential negotiations  the sequential combinatorial auctions procedure implements the generalized vickrey auction  which is a strategy proof mechanism for the allocation of multiple goods among several competing agents  a sequential negotiation method is suggested as an alternative task allocation mechanism  the method automates a multi lateral negotiation process in which the company is the leader  and the contractors are followers  in the second stage  the contractors are allowed to exchange the tasks among themselves so as to decrease their operational costs  the exchanges may or may not include money transfers  we found that the first stage procedures yield fairly efficient allocations and the second stage further improves them  the obtained allocations are considerably more efficient than the solutions generated by a reasonable benchmark heuristic  moreover  the allocations  costs are close to a lower bound established by the optimal allocation of a central planner  that is  the price of decentralization is shown to be small   c  2017 elsevier ltd  all rights reserved  
 the determinants of garage prices and their interaction with curbside regulation the market for parking is characterized by intrinsic distortions such as cruising in search of a parking space and garage market power  theoretical studies stress that the price differential between curbside and garage parking fees is critical in addressing this inefficiency  yet  the interactions between the two have received little attention to date in the literature  by drawing on a new self constructed database for all the garages in the city of barcelona  we empirically explore the determinants of garage prices  our results indicate that prices are mainly influenced by fixed and variable cost drivers  the dominance position of the garage in its surrounding market and the garage s interaction with curbside parking  we also find that prices react to the scarcity of parking spaces in the street and to the curbside price fixed by the public authority   c  2017 elsevier ltd  all rights reserved  
 the difference between hub and non hub airports   an airside capacity perspective airport airside capacity is limited by the runway system capacity or apron capacity  whichever is more constraining  sometimes  taxiway system can also impose constraint to airside capacity  but in the case of fully developed taxiway systems  involving parallel taxiway  high speed exits  etc   that is usually not an issue  to determine which airside element is more constraining it is not always as simple as comparing runway system and apron capacities directly one to another  it is important to understand and take into consideration their relationship  runway apron relationship depends on demand characteristics e g  dominant market segments  e g  scheduled  charter  low cost  general aviation  cargo   and or specific traffic patterns  hubbing or point to point services  seasonality in demand  etc    the paper brings up the issue of available airside capacity under different traffic characteristics  faced by hubs vs  non hub airports  and the necessity to understand runway apron interdependency in order to properly identify the bottleneck on the airside  referring to earlier findings related to apron capacity analysis  the paper summarizes various factors that affect apron capacity at non hub and hub airports and uses them to define the runway apron relationship  as well as its role in the process of analyzing airside capacity under various demand characteristics  the main finding is that functional relationship between the runway system and aprons is much stronger in the case of hub airports  and should be carefully considered when analyzing airside capacity  besides runway capacity  few other variables that affect apron capacity at hub airports are discussed  generic examples are used to support the discussion   c  2017 elsevier ltd  all rights reserved  
 the dynamics of commuting over the life course  swiss experiences daily travel behavior  and especially commuting behavior  is strongly determined by the location of the places of residence  education and employment  after changes in these spatial choices  people inevitably show a travel behavior that is different from the travel behavior before these relocations occurred  therefore  spatial alterations provide interesting starting points for policies and other interventions aiming at travel behavior change  as habits and routines are broken or at least weakened  and individuals reconsider their behavior and consciously reflect their decisions  the life oriented approach is utilized in order to examine the interrelationships of various life choices with respect to the development of the commuting behavior over time and over people s life courses  these analyses require corresponding longitudinal data  which was collected in the zurich region  switzerland  in a retrospective survey covering the 20 year period from 1985 to 2004  the results show that the different dimensions of the life course are highly interdependent  the changes in residence  education and employment are to a great extent related to one another  occurring simultaneously rather than successively  a strong connection is also observed between the ownership of mobility tools and their usage for commuting  this applies likewise to changes in occupation  encompassing both education and employment  and the most frequently used mode of transport for the commuting trips  following a residential relocation  the mean distances to the places of occupation decline  indicating that moving is used as a mean to reduce commuting  in contrast  changes in education and employment lead to considerably longer commuting distances  interestingly  persons altering their places of residence and occupation simultaneously have even lengthier commutes  the ownership of both cars and public transport tickets rises after all changes  concurrent with this increase in mobility tool availability  the corresponding usage for commuting also expands overall  private and public transport are in general more frequently used  while cycling and walking decline   c  2017 elsevier ltd  all rights reserved  
 the e commerce parcel delivery market and the implications of home b2c deliveries vs pick up points the last mile has been characterised as the most expensive and complicated part of the supply chain  featuring negative impacts on pollution and congestion in densely populated areas  the arrival of e commerce has accentuated the number of individual home deliveries  increasing the flows in the last mile  investigating how to improve the efficiency of logistics in urban areas is a major driver for the success of e commerce  and contributes to alleviating the negative externalities of urban freight transport derived from it  by means of interviews and empirical analysis  this article targets two goals  firstly  to conciliate different perspectives about the structure and cost drivers in the market  secondly  within this framework  to propose a cost model for two of the most popular methods of last mile delivery  the home delivery and delivery through pick up points  main findings  it is concluded that the parcel delivery market remains under a strong competition  driven by efficiency and with little space for innovations  parcel delivery companies have been handling with failed deliveries via different solutions  while failed deliveries have an impact on the cost structure  achieving higher economies of density has a higher impact on costs reduction  pick up points offer a solution to failed deliveries while they increase the density of deliveries at the same time  when the number of parcels to the pick up point is high enough  benefits for both logistics carriers and the society are achieved  this is due to the reductions in the overall number of vehicle kilometres travelled  vkt   results show that reductions can be obtained with a limited number of pick up points  in this paper  a novel typology of the b2c logistics sector is presented together with the most important cost drivers for the sector  in the analysis  an original cost model incorporates cost drivers disregarded in previous modelling efforts  such as the failed deliveries  the modal choice of companies and customers and the stoppage time of a delivery  furthermore  primary data were obtained to develop the calculations and the results were validated by companies of the sector  
 the effect of airports on regional development  evidence from the construction of regional airports in norway this paper estimates the effect of airports on regibnal development using the substantial increase of airports in the 1970s in norway as the source of variation  the effects are estimated using a difference indifference design by comparing municipalities with a shorter distance to the nearest airport  treated  to three sets of control municipalities  as regional impacts  the paper considers population and employment at the municipality level  the results demonstrate a positive but not significant effect on population and employment  the point estimates indicate that the population in municipalities near the constructed airports increased by 5  from 1970 to 1980  but the overall imprecision of the estimates makes it impossible to reject the hypothesis that the airports had no regional impacts   c  2017 elsevier ltd  all rights reserved  
 the effect of ambient light condition on road traffic collisions involving pedestrians on pedestrian crossings previous research suggests darkness increases the risk of a collision involving a pedestrian and the severity of any injury suffered  pedestrian crossings are intended to make it safer to cross the road  but it is not clear whether they are effective at doing this after dark  compared with during daylight  biannual clock changes resulting from transitions to and from daylight saving time were used to compare rtcs in the uk during daylight and darkness but at the same time of day  thus controlling for potential influences on rtc numbers not related to the ambient light condition  odds ratios and regression discontinuity analysis suggested there was a significantly greater risk of a pedestrian rtc at a crossing after dark than during daylight  results also suggested the risk of an rtc after dark was greater at a pedestrian crossing than at a location at least 50 m away from a crossing  whilst these results show the increased danger to pedestrians using a designated crossing after dark  this increased risk is not due to a lack of lighting at these locations as 98  of rtcs at pedestrian crossings after dark were lit by road lighting  this raises questions about the adequacy and effectiveness of the lighting used at pedestrian crossings  
 the effect of billboard design specifications on driving  a pilot study decades of research on the effects of advertising billboards on road accident rates  driver performance  and driver visual scanning behavior  has produced no conclusive firidings  we suggest that road safety researchers should shift their focus and attempt to identify the billboard characteristics that are most distracting to drivers  this line of research may produce concrete guidelines for permissible billboards that would be likely to reduce the influence of the billboards on road safety  the current study is a first step towards this end  a pool of 161 photos of real advertising billboards was used as stimuli within a triple task paradigm designed to simulate certain components of driving  each trial consisted of one ongoing tracking task accompanied by two additional concurrent tasks   1  billboard observation task  and  2  circle color change identification task  five clusters of billboards  identified by conducting a cluster analysis of their graphic content  were used as a within variable in one way anovas conducted on performance level data collected from the multiple tasks  chister 5  labeled loaded billboards  yielded significantly deteriorated performance on the tracking task  cluster 4  labeled graphical billboards  yielded deteriorated performance primarily on the color change identification task  cluster 3  labeled minimal billboards  had no effect on any of these tasks  we strongly recommend that these clusters be systematically explored in experiments involving additional real driving settings  such as driving simulators and field studies  this will enable validation of the current results and help incorporate them into real driving situations  
 the effect of brt implementation and streetscape redesign on physical activity  a case study of mexico city the reconfiguration of urban transportation system has emerged at the forefront of population wide interventions to tackle physical inactivity  however  the effectiveness of these interventions remains understudied  especially in developing countries  using self reported physical activity data from pre  and post intervention periods  this study examines the impact of bus rapid transit  brt  and complete street implementation on walking and cycling levels of catchment area residents in mexico city  propensity score matching is applied to control for sociodemographics when evaluating intervention effects on walking for transport  walking for recreation  and cycling for transport  on average  individuals living in post intervention conditions tend to achieve 29 min more of walking for transport per week  however  the intervention effect on cycling for transport is insignificant  using clustering techniques  intervention effects are evaluated across different sociodemographic groups  women with low education experience the greatest increases in walking for transport  sociodemographic clusters characterized by higher education experience improvements in recreational walking  overall  brt implementation and streetscape improvements enhance physical activity  specifically walking  and the impact of these interventions vary across different sociodemographic subgroups   c  2017 elsevier ltd  all rights reserved

 the effect of destination type and travel period on the behavior of the price of airline tickets the effects of customer characteristics  differentiating between tourist and business travelers  and the date of travel are considered important elements in airline price behavior  in the literature  the difference between tourist and business travel is based on consumer characteristics  however  the main contribution of this paper is to examine this difference with respect to the characteristics of the destination  thus  in this paper  we consider the top  and bottom ranked tourist destination cities  to differentiate between most and least visited tourist destinations  and two travel periods  a holiday period and an offpeak period  in order to analyze the effect of the destination and travel period on airline price behavior  the results show that the price level is highest during the holiday period to the lowest ranked tourist destinations  and that the price dispersion is highest during the holiday period but to the top ranked tourist destinations   c  2017 elsevier ltd  all rights reserved  
 the effect of motorcycle helmet fit on estimating head impact kinematics from residual liner crush proper helmet fit is important for optimizing head protection during an impact  yet many motorcyclists wear helmets that do not properly fit their heads  the goals of this study are i  to quantify how a mismatch in headform size and motorcycle helmet size affects headform peak acceleration and head injury criteria  hic   and ii  to determine if peak acceleration  hic  and impact speed can be estimated from the foam liner s maximum residual crush depth or residual crush volume  shorty style helmets  4 sizes of a single model  were tested on instrumented headforms  4 sizes  during linear impacts between 2 0 and 10 5 m s to the forehead region  helmets were ct scanned to quantify residual crush depth and volume  separate linear regression models were used to quantify how the response variables  peak acceleration  g   hic  and impact speed  m s   were related to the predictor variables  maximum crush depth  mm   crush volume  cm 3    and the difference in circumference between the helmet and headform  cm    overall  we found that increasingly oversized helmets reduced peak headform acceleration and hic for a given impact speed for maximum residual crush depths less than 7 9 mm and residual crush volume less than 40 cm3  below these levels of residual crush  we found that peak headform acceleration  hic  and impact speed can be estimated from a helmet s residual crush  above these crush thresholds  large variations in headform kinematics are present  possibly related to densification of the foam liner during the impact  
 the effect of positive and negative emotions on young  drivers  a simulator study the study examined the influence of affect induction on actual risk taking behavior in a driving simulator  as well as the links between personal variables  relevance of driving to self esteem  sensation seeking  and the level of risky driving  eighty young drivers aged 18 21  m   19 24  sd   0 75  were randomly divided into four induction groups  relaxing positive affect  arousing positive affect  negative affect  and neutral affect  the participants drove on a simulator  with various parameters of risky driving measured before and after emotion priming  as predicted  arousing positive affect and negative affect led to increased risky driving  whereas relaxing positive affect moderated risk taking  in addition  the results confirm previous findings regarding the personal variables  revealing that higher levels of relevance of driving to self esteem and sensation seeking are associated with higher levels of risk taking in the simulated driving  the findings indicate that the driver s emotional state has a significant effect on risk taking on the road  moreover  they show that the conventional use of negative affect in safe driving campaigns is liable to heighten the tendency for risky driving rather than reduce it  in contrast  relaxing positive affect was found to lead to lower risk taking  the study is unique in revealing a correlation between results previously obtained for the willingness to drive recklessly and actual risky driving behavior observed on a driving simulator  by expanding the understanding of the motivations for youngsters  risky driving  the study may aid in designing effective  theoretically sound  interventions aimed at reducing the tendency for dangerous driving among young drivers   c  2017 elsevier ltd  all rights reserved  
 the effect of wind turbines alongside motorways on drivers  behaviour this paper presents the results of a first study aimed at investigating whether the presence of wind turbines in close proximity to motorways leads to behavioural adaptations among passing drivers  empirical data from loop detectors and temporary video cameras were analysed in a study employing a before and after design at a site near rotterdam  the netherlands  analyses of driving speed and standard deviation of speed  corrected for trend effects through the use of control sites  were performed as well as analyses of the lateral position and standard deviation of the lateral position and an observation of serious traffic conflicts  the results showed that constructing wind turbines alongside a motorway led to some clearly observable effects on drivers  behaviour  the analyses of the speed data showed that the mean speed was lowered by 2 24km h  corrected for trend effects  after the construction of the wind turbines while the standard deviation of the speed significantly increased  after the construction of the wind turbines  drivers took a lateral position somewhat more to the left hand side in their driving lane  there was an indication close to the 0 05 significance level  p 0 057  that the standard deviation of the lateral position slightly increased when the rotor blades were in transversal position  in the before period as well as in the after period  no serious traffic conflicts were registered  the increase in standard deviation of speed and in lateral position are two factors that intrinsically can have an unfavourable effect on road safety  however  the observed order of magnitude of the change was shown to be quite limited  earlier research suggests that negative effects on road safety are only expected for changes substantially greater than the ones that were observed in this study  on the other hand  there was a significant reduction in driving speed  which might have a favourable effect on the expected number and severity of crashes  although it could also be a compensatory mechanism that indirectly indicates a reduced driving performance  from these findings  it can be concluded that  based on the observed variables  no substantial negative effects for road safety were found in the present study  the authors recommend continuous monitoring and further research on the topic  
 the effects of activity travel context and individual attitudes on car sharing decisions under travel time uncertainty  a hybrid choice modeling approach people s daily decision to use car sharing rather than other transport modes for conducting a specific activity has been investigated recently in assessing the market potential of car sharing systems  most studies have estimated transport mode choice models with an extended choice set using attributes such as average travel time and costs  however  car sharing systems have some distinctive features  users have to reserve a car in advance and pay time based costs for using the car  therefore  the effects of activity travel context and travel time uncertainty require further consideration in models that predict car sharing demand  moreover  the relationships between individual latent attitudes and the intention to use car sharing have not yet been investigated in much detail  in contributing to the research on car sharing  the present study is designed to examine the effects of activity travel context and individual latent attitudes on short term car sharing decisions under travel time uncertainty  the effects of all these factors were simultaneously estimated using a hybrid choice modeling framework  the data used in this study was collected in the netherlands  2015 using a stated choice experiment  hypothetical choice situations were designed to collect respondents  intention to use a shared car for their travel to work  a total of 791 respondents completed the experiment  the estimation results suggest that time constraints  lack of spontaneity and a larger variation in travel times have significant negative effects on people s intention to use a shared car  furthermore  this intention is significantly associated with latent attitudes about pro environmental preferences  the symbolic value of cars  and privacy seeking  
 the effects of drinking and driving laws on car crashes  injuries  and deaths  evidence from chile this paper analyzes the effects of lowering the legal blood alcohol content limit for drivers from 0 05 to 0 03 grams of alcohol per deciliter of blood  g dl  and increasing license suspension periods for offenders  we take advantage of a rich data set of administrative records that allow us to identify direct measures of accidents involving alcohol including fatalities and injuries  results show a significant decrease of 32  in alcohol related car accidents right after the law was approved but the effects moderate over time  15  after three years   there is also a significant reduction in injuries  31  right after the approval and 11  after three years  but no statistically significant effects on deaths  complementary analysis of blood samples shows that the law had an effect on blood alcohol content  bac  of male drivers up to the 90th percentile of the bac distribution  
 the effects of european transport policy on peripheral countries  the case of spain europe has always had a strong modal imbalance  with road comprising a much greater share of freight transport than the alternative transport modes  although road is the mode that best meets current transport demand requirements  it has also benefited from market failures  these market failures  including negative externalities  have led the european union and its member states to implement the common transport policy  the aim of which is to tackle these externalities and include their cost in the final price of transport  one of the measures undertaken in order to reflect the real costs of freight transport has been road pricing  however  this measure does not affect all member states equally  this article focuses on the effects of road pricing for peripheral countries  such countries feel the negative effects more strongly due to their geographical location and the fact that their modal pattern is even more unbalanced than that of central european countries  therefore  this paper takes a novel and practical approach by evaluating the impact of road pricing on the euros per ton cost of spanish shipments to three european destinations  this study seeks to quantify the additional cost incurred on exports of a peripheral country  spain  as a result of road pricing  this additional cost can logically affect the export capability of a country and its external competitiveness  especially in cases such as spain  where its competitiveness is largely based on the price of its exports  one way to avoid the effects of road pricing is to use alternative modes  however  these modes are not always well suited to the demand  that is why an analysis of the current state of the two main alternative modes  rail and sea  has also been carried out to determine their capability to capture traffic diverted from road  the results show a moderate impact on costs but this can  however  affect the country s competitiveness  the paper also highlights the need to work on developing alternative modes  especially rail  given the difficulties they face in competing with road and meeting demand requirements  
 the effects of lane width  shoulder width  and road cross sectional reallocation on drivers  behavioral adaptations previous research has shown that lane width reduction makes drivers operate vehicles closer to the center of the road whereas hard shoulder widening induces a position farther away from the road s center  the goal of the present driving simulator study was twofold  first  it was aimed at further investigating the respective effects of lane and shoulder width on in lane positioning strategies  by examining vehicle distance from the center of the lane  the second aim was to assess the impact on safety of three possible cross sectional reallocations of the width of the road  i e   three lane width reductions with concomitant shoulder widening at a fixed cross sectional width  as compared to a control road  the results confirmed that lane width reduction made participants drive closer to the road s center  however  in lane position was affected differently by lane narrowing  depending on the traffic situation  in the absence of oncoming traffic  lane narrowing gave rise to significant shifts in the car s distance from the lane s center toward the edge line  whereas this distance remained similar across lane widths during traffic periods  when the shoulders were at least 0 50 m wide  participants drove farther away from both the road center and the lane center  road reallocation operations resulted in vehicles positioned farther away from the edge of the road and less swerving behavior  without generating higher driving speeds  finally  it is argued that road space reallocation may serve as a good low cost tool for providing a recovery area for steering errors  without impairing drivers  behavior  
 the effects of licence disqualification on drink drivers  is it the same for everyone  drink driving remains a major road safety concern that creates a significant social burden  licence disqualification continues to play a key role in drink driving deterrence and sanctions together with police enforcement to address the problem in most motorised countries  however  on going questions remain regarding the differing effect of licence disqualification periods between first time and repeat offenders  and between other sub groups of offenders  as a result  this study aimed to determine whether   a  differences exist in re offence rates of convicted drink drivers between  the period between committing the drink driving offence and licence disqualification  pre licence disqualification   during the period of licence disqualification  and after being re licensed  post licence restoration   and  b  differential effects of offence rates are evident based on blood alcohol content  bac   gender  age  repeat offender status and crash involvement at the time of offence  the sample consisted of 29 204 drink driving offenders detected in victoria  australia between 1 january 1996 and 30 september 2002  the analysis indicated that licence disqualifications were effective as drink driving offenders had a significantly lower rate of offending  both drink driving and other traffic offences  during licence disqualifications compared to pre licence disqualification and post licence restoration periods  the influence of licence disqualification appeared to extend beyond the disqualification period  as offence rates were lower during post licence restoration than during pre licence disqualification  interestingly  the highest rate of offending  both for drink driving and other traffic offences  was during the pre licence disqualification period  which suggests offenders are particularly vulnerable to drink and drive while waiting to be sanctioned  a consistent pattern of results was evident across genders and age groups  additionally  those who were involved in a crash at the same time as their index offence had lower offence rates  compared to those who were not involved in a crash  for all periods  although for general traffic offences  the offence rate was highest in the post licence restoration period for those who had a crash at index offence  this indicates that being involved in a crash may deter these offenders  at least in the short term  the implications of the results for managing both first time and repeat offenders are discussed  
 the electric vehicle routing problem with nonlinear charging function electric vehicle routing problems  e vrps  extend classical routing problems to consider the limited driving range of electric vehicles  in general  this limitation is overcome by introducing planned detours to battery charging stations  most existing e vrp models assume that the battery charge level is a linear function of the charging time  but in reality the function is nonlinear  in this paper we extend current e vrp models to consider nonlinear charging functions  we propose a hybrid metaheuristic that combines simple components from the literature and components specifically designed for this problem  to assess the importance of nonlinear charging functions  we present a computational study comparing our assumptions with those commonly made in the literature  our results suggest that neglecting nonlinear charging may lead to infeasible or overly expensive solutions  furthermore  to test our hybrid metaheuristic we propose a new 120 instance testbed  the results show that our method performs well on these instances   c  2017 elsevier ltd  all rights reserved  
 the emergence and effects of the ultra low cost carrier  ulcc  business model in the us airline industry the effects of  low cost carriers   lccs  such as southwest airlines and jetblue airways on the competitive landscape of the u s  airline industry have been thoroughly documented in the academic literature and the popular press  however  the more recent emergence of another distinct airline business model the  ultra low cost carrier   ulcc  has received considerably less attention  by focusing on cost efficiencies and unbundled service offerings  the ulccs have been able to undercut the fares of both traditional network and low cost carriers in the markets they serve  in this paper  we conduct an analysis of ulccs in the u s  aviation industry and demonstrate how these carriers  business models  costs  and effects on air transportation markets differ from those of the traditional lccs  we first describe the factors that have enabled ulccs to achieve a cost advantage over traditional lccs and network legacy carriers  then  using econometric models  we examine the effects of ulcc and lcc presence  entry  and exit on base airfares in 3 004 u s  air transportation markets from 2010 to 2015  we find that in 2015  ulcc presence in a market was associated with market base fares 21  lower than average  as compared to an 8  average reduction for lcc presence  we also find that while ulcc and lcc entry both result in a 14  average reduction in fares one year after entry  ulccs are three times as likely to abandon a market within two years of entry than are the lccs  the results suggest that the ulccs represent a distinct business model from traditional lccs and that as the ulccs grow  they will continue to play a unique and increasingly important role in the u s  airline industry   c  2017 elsevier ltd  all rights reserved  
 the epidemiology of driving in later life  sociodemographic  health and functional characteristics  predictors of incident cessation  and driving expectations aim  to describe population level characteristics of drivers and non drivers in a cohort of older australians and identify predictors of driving cessation and expectations  methods  the sample comprised the oldest cohort of the path through life project who were assessed 4 times between 2001 and 2013  at waves 3 and 4 questions on driving were included in the study interview  data were also collected on health  physical and cognitive function and psychosocial wellbeing  descriptive analyses compared drivers and non drivers on sociodemographic  health and functional variables and regression models identified predictors of cessation and driving expectations  results  92 5  of the sample were current drivers  they reported better physical  mental and cognitive health than non drivers  drivers expected to drive for another 12 6 years  the majority drove 6  days per week  four percent of the sample ceased driving over the four year follow up  predictors of cessation were financial problems  driving expectations and driving fewer kilometres per week  predictors of expectations were poorer self rated health  mastery  difficulties reading maps  self rated visual function  years of driving experience  and fewer kilometres driven per week  conclusion  driving is normative for many older australians in their 70s  similar factors are associated with actual cessation and expectation of driving suggesting that older adults do have a sense of their expected driving life  
 the fehmarn belt duopoly   can the ferry compete with a tunnel  the fehmarn belt is a strait between denmark and germany  currently served by a ferry operator  we analyse competition between the ferry service and a planned tunnel  the fehmarn belt fixed link  we develop a differentiated duopoly model to address two questions  1  will the tunnel induce the ferry to exit the market once it operates  2  will the tunnel s toll revenue suffice to cover its cost  using real world data and traffic forecasts  we show that it should not be taken for granted that the ferry will exit the market  and that if the ferry competes  the tunnel project will make a loss   c  2017 elsevier ltd  all rights reserved  
 the four knowledges of transport planning  enacting a more communicative  trans disciplinary policy and decision making there is widespread criticism of much transport planning practice for relying on particular   technical   knowledge forms characterized by instrumental  means end rationality  at the same time politicians are criticized for taking  political  decisions with not enough regard for the outcomes of such technical work  increasingly attempts to capture the embodied knowledge and values of citizens are also brought into this contested terrain  but which knowledge forms should be significant in making policy and taking decisions  and how might they be brought together in political decision making which is itself subject to its own rationality  this paper argues that the variety of knowledge forms in everyday transport planning processes should be more transparently articulated  subsequent reflexion can help enhance the quality of transport planning processes  while such transparency bolsters the democratic legitimacy of the outputs of such processes  such a more explicitly communicative  trans disciplinary mode of governance would help to challenge the power of political rationality  this conclusion has implications for how transport planning as a discipline is enacted  
 the graal of carpooling  green and social optimization from crowd sourced data carpooling  i e  the sharing of vehicles to reach common destinations  is often performed to reduce costs and pollution  recent work on carpooling takes into account  besides mobility matches  also social aspects and  more generally  non monetary incentives  in line with this  we present graal  a data driven methodology for green and social carpooling  graal optimizes a carpooling system not only by minimizing the number of cars needed at the city level  but also by maximizing the enjoyability of people sharing a trip  we introduce a measure of enjoyability based on people s interests  social links  and tendency to connect to people with similar or dissimilar interests  graal computes the enjoyability within a set of users from crowd sourced data  and then uses it on real world datasets to optimize a weighted linear combination of number of cars and enjoyability  to tune this weight  and to investigate the users  interest on the social aspects of carpooling  we conducted an online survey on potential carpooling users  we present the results of applying graal on real world crowd sourced data from the cities of rome and san francisco  computational results are presented from both the city and the user perspective  using the crowd sourced weight  graal is able to significantly reduce the number of cars needed  while keeping a high level of enjoyability on the tested data set  from the user perspective  we show how the entire per car distribution of enjoyability is increased with respect to the baselines   c  2017 published by elsevier ltd  
 the hierarchical mixed rural postman problem in this paper  we study a generalization of the hierarchical chinese postman problem on a mixed graph where only a subset of arcs and edges require a service to be accomplished following a hierarchical order  the problem  called the hierarchical mixed rural postman problem  also generalizes the rural postman problem and thus is np hard  we propose a new mathematical formulation  and introduce two effective solution algorithms  the first procedure is a matheuristic that is based on the exact solution of a variant of the mixed rural postman problem for each hierarchy  the second approach is a tabu search algorithm based on different improvement and diversification strategies  computational results on an extended set of instances show how the proposed solution methods are quite effective and efficient when compared to the solutions of a branch and cut algorithm stopped after one hour of computation  
 the impact of aircraft takeoff thrust setting on nox emissions reduced thrust takeoff has the potential to reduce aircraft related nox emissions at airports  however this remains to be investigated using flight data  this paper analyses the effect of takeoff roll thrust setting variability on the magnitude and spatial distribution of nox emissions using high resolution data records for 497 airbus a319 activities at london heathrow  thrust setting varies between 67 and 97  of maximum  and aircraft operating in the bottom 10th percentile emit on average 514 g less nox per takeoff roll  32  reduction  than the top 10th percentile  however this is dependent on takeoff roll duration  spatial analysis suggests that peak nox emissions  corresponding to the start of the takeoff roll  can be reduced by up to 25  by adopting reduced thrust takeoff activities  furthermore  the length of the emission source also decreases  consequently  the use of reduced thrust takeoff may enable improved local air quality at airports   c  2017 elsevier ltd  all rights reserved  
 the impact of attitudes and perceptions on travel mode choice and car ownership in a chinese megacity  the case of guangzhou the objective of this research is to understand intentions to buy a car and how car ownership  together with other personal  situational and attitudinal factors  influences travel mode choice in a chinese megacity  a survey was carried out in guangzhou  china to examine respondents  car ownership and travel mode perceptions and choices  as well as personal and situational characteristics  a quota sampling procedure was used to select members of three different groups  car owners  no car but planning to buy one in the next 5 years car intenders  and no car and not planning to buy one  we find that car ownership is the most important among included predictors of travel mode choice  which also depend on other personal and situational factors  but only indirectly by attitudinal factors  however  attitudinal factors have a strong impact on the intention to buy a car  while controlling for other personal and situational factors  our results suggest that several policies can be further improved in china for greater effectiveness in reducing the car use of car owners and car intenders   c  2017 elsevier ltd  all rights reserved  
 the impact of childhood symptoms of conduct disorder on driving after drinking in adulthood objectives  while some existing studies suggest that conduct disorder  cd  significantly increases risk of driving after drinking  outcomes have typically been assessed only up to age 21 years  therefore  the current study sought to assess the relationship between symptoms of cd during childhood  before age 15 years  and the risk of engaging in driving after drinking during adulthood  methods  data are taken from interviews with 5299 respondents derived from the 2011 2013 cycles of the monitor  an ongoing cross sectional telephone survey of adults aged 18  years in one canadian province  a hierarchical entry binary logistic regression analysis of driving after drinking in the previous year was conducted  consisting of measures of demographic characteristics  sex  age  marital status  education  region   driving exposure  problem alcohol use  symptoms of attention deficit hyperactivity disorder  adhd   and childhood  before age 15 years  symptoms of cd  results  childhood symptoms of cd significantly increased the odds of reporting driving after drinking in adulthood  or 2 59  95  ci 1 67  4 03  p   0 001   even after adjusting for demographic characteristics  driving exposure  problem alcohol use  and symptoms of adhd  childhood symptoms of cd significantly increased the odds of the behaviour  or   1 67  95  ci  1 00  2 79  p   0 05   conclusions  results from a general population survey in one canadian province suggest that symptoms of cd during childhood are associated with significantly increased odds of driving after drinking in adulthood  these findings add to a growing literature  and could suggest that within treatment for cd special attention should be focused on driver safety  additional implications for injury prevention will be discussed  
 the impact of coordinated policies on air pollution emissions from road transportation in china improving air quality across mainland china is an urgent policy challenge  while much of the problem is linked to china s broader reliance on coal and other fossil fuels across the energy system  road transportation is an important and growing source of air pollution  here we use an energy economic model  embedded in a regional emissions air quality climate and health  reach  integrated assessment framework  to analyze the impacts of implementing vehicle emissions standards  es  together with a broader economy wide climate policy on total air pollution in five species and 30 chinese provinces  we find that full and immediate implementation of existing vehicle es at china 3 iii level or tighter will significantly reduce the contribution of transportation to degraded air quality by 2030  we further show that road transport es function as an important complement to an economy wide price on co2  which delivers significant co benefits for air pollution reduction that are concentrated primarily in non transportation sectors  going forward  vehicle emissions standards and an economy  wide carbon price form a highly effective coordinated policy package that supports china s air quality and climate change mitigation goals   c  2017 elsevier ltd  all rights reserved  
 the impact of flooding on road transport  a depth disruption function transport networks underpin economic activity by enabling the movement of goods and people  during extreme weather events transport infrastructure can be directly or indirectly damaged  posing a threat to human safety  and causing significant disruption and associated economic and social impacts  flooding  especially as a result of intense precipitation  is the predominant cause of weather related disruption to the transport sector  existing approaches to assess the disruptive impact of flooding on road transport fail to capture the interactions between floodwater and the transport system  typically assuming a road is fully operational or fully blocked  which is not supported by observations  in this paper we develop a relationship between depth of standing water and vehicle speed  the function that describes this relationship has been constructed by fitting a curve to video analysis supplemented by a range of quantitative data that has be extracted from existing studies and other safety literature  the proposed relationship is a good fit to the observed data  with an r squared of 0 95  the significance of this work is that it is simple to incorporate our function into existing transport models to produce better estimates of flood induced delays and we demonstrate this with an example from the 28th june 2012 flood in newcastle upon tyne  uk   c  2017 the authors  published by elsevier ltd  
 the impact of local work and residential balance on vehicle miles traveled  a new direct approach this paper introduces a new approach for explaining the effects of spatial competition for opportunities based on a cumulative opportunities measure of accessibility  we focus on the case of the labor market where some municipalities offer too few workplaces for their local population  forcing some of their residents to long drives  we apply this new accessibility measure to explain households  annual mileage in switzerland using a heckman model to account for carless households  we find that car travel demand is much greater in municipalities with a relative undersupply in the local labor market compared to a balanced or oversupplied local labor market  the results show that driving increases with greater distance to the labor market center  the model estimates allow policy makers and planners to quantify as a first assessment the expected average mileage in each municipality for new settlements and to identify municipalities with low expected annual mileage  
 the impact of low cost carriers on non aeronautical revenues in airport  an empirical study of uk airports the purpose of this study is to clarify the impact of low cost carriers  lccs  on non aeronautical revenues in 26 uk airports from 1999 to 2008  increasingly non aeronautical revenues have become an important source for airport revenue  our literature review highlights that there is little consensus in empirical results concerning lcc impact on non aeronautical revenues  some of these report positive impact while others show negative impact  we estimate a non aeronautical revenue function which includes frequency share of lcc  air transport movements  atms   number of passengers and population of hinterland of each observed airports as explanatory variables  in addition to this  we produce marginal revenue estimates for both the case of capacity constrained and capacity unconstrained circumstance in airports  as a result  in the case of a non capacity constrained airport  on average  the marginal revenue of an additional lcc atm is  sic 147 while for non lcc atm it is  sic 226  on the other hand  in the case of a capacity constrained airport  on average  substituting one non lcc atm with an lcc atm reduces revenue by  sic 79  2017 elsevier ltd  all rights reserved  
 the impact of medical and non medical prescription opioid use on motor vehicle collision risk background  production and distribution of prescription opioid analgesic drugs  pos  has increased immensely across the globe  both medical  mpo  and non medical  nmpo  use of opioid medication are associated with increased rates of morbidity and mortality  including possibly motor vehicle collisions  the current study examined data from a population level survey to determine the impact of any po  mpo  and nmpo use on collision risk  methods  data were based on the 2010 2011 centre for addiction and mental health monitor  a regionally stratified general population telephone survey of adults  n   3428   three binary logistic regressions of self reported collision involvement in the previous 12 months were conducted  each consisting of   1  measures of demographic characteristics  driving exposure  and binge drinking  and  2  one of three measures of po use  any po use  mpo use  or nmpo use   results  any po use and mpo use were associated with increased collision risk  or  1 60  ci   1 06  2 40 and or   1 62  ci   1 07  2 45  respectively   the odds ratio for nmpo use did not reach statistical significance  or   1 86  ci   0 91  3 77  p   0 09   conclusions  these results suggested that doctor prescribed po use is associated with a 62  increase in collision risk  although not a statistically significant finding  nmpo use may also be associated with increased collision risk  the magnitude of increased collision risk associated with po use was comparable to that of driving after alcohol or cannabis use   c  2017 elsevier ltd  all rights reserved  
 the impact of metropolitan  county  and local land use on driving emissions in us metropolitan areas  mediator effects of vehicle travel characteristics many municipalities in the u s  pursue compact development to reduce greenhouse gas  ghg  emissions from driving  despite the efforts  however  recent studies suggest that some land use strategies such as densification and mixed use development may result in slower vehicle movements  and consequently generate more driving emissions  since vehicle miles of travel  vmt  is only a proxy and not an exact measure of emissions  reduction in vmt may not lead to a proportional reduction in transportation ghg emissions  aside from local land use efforts  regional factors also influence vehicle travel and associated emissions  this study investigates the relationship between land use  vehicle travel  and driving emissions in the selected u s  metropolitan areas at multiple geographic levels  the study employed structural equation modeling  sem  techniques to examine how land use influences vehicle travel characteristics and associated emissions  the main data sources for the analyses include the 2009 national household travel survey  nhts  add on samples and the smart location database  sld  from the u s  environmental protection agency  epa   the study results show that vmt reduction and the associated environmental benefit do not show a one on one relationship due to the emissions penalty of lowered vehicle operating speed  vehicle travel and associated emissions are not only influenced by local urban form factors but also affected by the greater geographical context  
 the impact of operational exposure and value of time on customer choice  evidence from the airline industry this study examines how a passenger s operational exposure and value of time moderate the relationship between airline quality and passenger choice  using a choice model  we show that the positive impact of providing nonstop flights and higher on time performance is enforced by a passenger s exposure to airline operations  and high time value  in particular  the results show that segmenting passengers by their operational exposure may generate demand  even in a fairly standardized service operations industry  such as the airline industry  finally  we discuss potential ways that airlines can discriminate the quality or the price of services provided based on our findings   c  2017 elsevier ltd  all rights reserved

 the impact of policy measures on consumer intention to adopt electric vehicles  evidence from china electric vehicles  evs  have been recognized as a promising means to reduce carbon emissions from the transport sector  to promote the adoption of evs  great efforts have been made and a series of policy measures have been introduced  however  the widespread adoption of evs is likely to be insufficient  this study divides policy measures into three catalogs  i e   financial incentive policy measures  information provision policy measures and convenience policy measures  and investigates how these policy measures motivate consumers to adopt evs and how such effects are moderated by consumers  environmental concern  the results of a survey of 324 respondents suggest that three catalogs of policy measures are positively and significantly related to evs adoption intention  and convenience policy measures are the most important policy measures to promote evs  in addition  the results indicate that consumers  environmental concern plays a moderating role in the relationships between two catalogs of policy measures  financial incentive policy measures and convenience policy measures  and evs adoption intention  implications and suggestions for future research are provided  
 the impact of regional environmental regulations on empirical vessel speeds economic theory suggests that the use of more expensive low sulphur fuel within an emission control area  eca  should result in lower vessel speeds  the objective of this paper is to investigate empirically  for the first time  whether the introduction of an eca affects vessel speeds  we utilize a dataset of observed vessel speeds derived from the automated information system  ais  for nearly 7000 eca boundary crossings over a three year period  our results suggest that introducing stricter sulphur regulations inside the north sea eca from 1  january 2015 did not affect vessel speeds once changes in macroeconomic conditions are accounted for   c  2017 elsevier ltd  all rights reserved  
 the impact of technology progress on aviation noise and emissions this paper investigates the effects of incremental and substantial innovations on aviation emissions and noise levels among aircraft engine combinations belonging to the boeing b737 and the airbus a320 families  we find a statistically significant impact of incremental technical progress on all environmental externalities both at the flight level and the passenger level  although substantial innovation is found to have a limited impact at the flight level  a noteworthy positive effect exists on per passenger externalities  these results point to the need for incentives in aviation technical progress in order to neutralize future negative environmental effects due to the expected traffic growth   c  2017 elsevier ltd  all rights reserved  
 the impact of the 2007 graduated driver licensing law in massachusetts on the rate of citations and licensing in teenage drivers objective  we recently demonstrated that the 2007 massachusetts graduated driving licensing  gdl  law decreased the rate of motor vehicle crashes in teenage drivers  to better understand this decrease  we sought to examine the law s impact on the issuance of driving licenses and traffic citations to teenage drivers  methods  citation and license data were obtained from the massachusetts department of transportation  census data were obtained from the census data center  two study periods were defined  pre gdl  2002 2006  and post gdl  2007 2012   two populations were defined  the study population  aged 16 17  and the control population  aged 25 29   the rates of licenses per population were compared pre vs  post gdl for the study group  the numbers of total  state  and local citations per population were compared pre vs  post gdl for both populations  a sensitivity analysis was performed for the rates of citations using licenses issued as a denominator  results  while licenses per population obtained by the study group decreased over the entire period  there was no change in the rate of decrease per year pre vs  post gdl  2 0  vs  1 4   p   0 6392   in the study population  total  state  and local citations decreased post gdl  17 8  vs  8 1   p   0 0001  3 7  vs  2 2   p   0 0001  14 1  vs  5 8   p   0 0001  respectively   in the control group  total and state citations did not change  26 7  vs  23 9   p   03606  9 2  vs  10 2   p   03404  respectively   and local citations decreased  17 5  vs  13 7   p   0 0389   the rates of decrease per year for total  state  and local citations were significantly greater in the study population compared with control  p   0 0001  p   0 0002  p   0 0001  respectively   conclusions  the 2007 gdl law in massachusetts was associated with fewer traffic citations without a change in the rate of licenses issued to teenagers  these findings suggest that 2007 gdl may be improving driving habits as opposed to motivating teenagers to delay the issuing of licenses   c  2017 published by elsevier ltd  on behalf of national safety council  
 the impact of voluntary travel behavior change measures   a meta analytical comparison of quasi experimental and experimental evidence personal travel planning  ptp  is generally regarded as an effective approach to voluntary travel behavior change in the domain of transportation research  however  this view has recently been challenged by findings from another research domain  public health research  reporting little or no effect of ptp based interventions  we argue that these conflicting results regarding the effectiveness of ptp based measures are due to different understandings of which research designs should be used  transportation research tends to be based on large scale quasi experimental designs whereas public health research tends to favor experimental designs such as randomized control trials  rcts   consequently  we argue  the discrepancy may at least partly be resolved by a more nuanced position on what empirical evidence really matters when evaluating if an intervention is effective or not  in the empirical part of the paper  we meta analytically re analyze ten quasi experimental ptp evaluation studies and report an experimental rct based study testing the effectiveness of a ptp strategy implemented in a major german city  including all information in one meta analytical synthesis yields a standardized effect size estimate of cohen s h   0 12  documenting a small but reliable effect of ptp interventions  when implementing a ptp like one of those analyzed in this paper  in other words  we can expect an average reduction of the car modal split share of about 5 percentage points  we close by discussing the implications of our results for future ptp evaluation studies and the dispute about what kind of empirical evidence really matters when evaluating the effectiveness of ptp measures   c  2017 elsevier ltd  all rights reserved  
 the impacts of congestion on automobile accessibility  what happens in large european cities  every day  a significant part of the population in large cities suffers transport congestion  one effect of this is a change in the spatial distribution of accessibility  which may lead to people or businesses finding themselves temporally in areas where accessibility values are lower than either desired or required  this paper studies changes in automobile accessibility over the course of the day  as caused by congestion of the road network in eight metropolitan areas of the european union  london  paris  madrid  berlin  barcelona  rome  hamburg and milan  the study was carried out using millions of data points on real speeds on segments of the road networks gathered over the course of two years from tomtom  r  devices  which provided for the incorporation of a dynamic perspective of accessibility  in each of the areas studied  the different impacts of congestion on automobile accessibility can be observed from differences in the distribution of opportunities and the provision of infrastructures  as well as from differences in culture and customs  despite these differences  all cities experience two peaks with a lower value during the morning and afternoon  however  results show differences in the intensity and form of the effects of congestion on accessibility in these metropolitan areas  london  paris and rome are the cities where congestion has the greatest impact on automobile accessibility  while the spanish cities are hardly affected by it  
 the implications of low quality bicycle paths on the gaze behaviour of young learner cyclists in a recent study  vansteenkiste et al   2014  described how low quality bicycle paths cause an apparent shift of visual attention from distant environmental regions to more proximate road properties  surprisingly  this shift of visual attention was not accompanied by an adaptation in cycling speed  the current experiment investigated to what extent these findings are applicable for young learner bicyclists  aged 6 12 years   since young learner bicyclists do not yet have mature visual and motor skills  it was expected that the implications of a poor road surface would be larger for them than for experienced adult bicyclists  in general  children looked less to the road and more to task irrelevant regions  but the magnitude of the shift of visual attention when cycling on a low quality bicycle track was similar to that of adults  although children cycled slower than adults  they did not cycle slower on the low quality track compared to the high quality track  overall  our results suggest that children displayed a different visual motor strategy than adults  characterized by lower cycling speeds and a different visual behaviour  and that they responded in a similar way to a low quality bicycle path as adults   c  2017 elsevier ltd  all rights reserved  
 the implications of the new sulphur limits on the european ro ro sector in an effort to reduce the environmental impacts of maritime transportation  the international maritime organization  imo  designated special sulphur emission control areas  secas  where ships are required to use low sulphur fuel  in january 2015  the sulphur limit within secas was lowered to 0 1   which can only be achieved if vessels are using pricier ultra low sulphur fuel  or invest in abatement technologies  the increased operating costs borne by ro ro operators in secas due to the stricter limits can result in the shutting down of some routes and a redistribution of cargo flows with land based alternatives  the exact repercussions of the new sulphur limits are difficult to identify in the wake of significant recent reductions of the fuel prices for both low sulphur and heavy fuel oil  this paper presents a modal split model that estimates modal shifts vis a vis competing maritime and land based modes available to shippers  this allows examining the implications of the recent low prices to modal choice  and the influence a potential increase in fuel prices may have  the model is applied to seven routes affected by the regulation based on data from a leading european ro ro operator  sensitivity analyses on market share data  cargo values  freight rates  and haulers rates are conducted  emissions inventories are constructed to assess the environmental efficacy of the seca regulation  the novelty of the proposed model lies in the examination of the ex post implications of shutting down a service and the redistribution of transport  recommendations to mitigate and reverse the negative side effects of such environmental legislation are proposed   c  2017 elsevier ltd  all rights reserved  
 the importance of export logistics and trade costs in emerging economies the aim of this article is to analyse the importance of logistical performance in international trade and its influence on costs  focusing on the study of emerging economies with a maritime border  for this purpose  gravity models are used to determine the importance of logistics in these countries  exports  taking as a representative variable the logistics performance index and each of its components  moreover  the equation of trade costs proposed by novy  2013  is used to determine the importance of logistical performance  the results show that the analysed countries should continue to strive for improvement in their logistical infrastructure  not only in order to boost their trade  but also to improve their export competitiveness  they have already undertaken both by the private and public sector in an attempt to progress internationally as a way of boosting country growth  
 the importance of markets  politics  and community support  an analysis of the small community air service development program across the u s   smaller communities face a challenging environment for attracting and retaining commercial air service as a result of airline industry changes  increasingly  airports and communities in smaller markets are developing air service development programs  asips  to provide incentives to reduce the financial risk to airlines while also marketing the new service to the community  a key source of funds for many of community based incentive programs is the small community air service development program  scasdp   which is a discretionary grant program operated by the department of transportation that provides funding to communities to supplement their own asips  despite the growing importance of this tool used by many communities  we know little about the factors that drive the allocation of scasdp grants by the dot  using an analysis of 164 applications to the scasdp program between 2011 and 2013  we assess the effect of market  political  and economic factors on the ddt s allocation of grants  our findings suggest the dot largely relies on the criteria in its published guidelines to allocate scasdp grants  specifically  the agency is more likely to approve applications for scasdp grants when the community has the support of members of congress who represent the community and the support of businesses and citizens through local match contributions  we also find the dot allocates grants to communities with letters of support from air carriers and prior experience  either through multiple applications in the past or through an experience air service development consultant  with the application process   c  2017 elsevier ltd  all rights reserved  
 the importance of spatial orientation and knowledge of traffic signs for children s traffic safety pre school children  as well as children from lower grades in primary school  who although rarely  completely independently participate in traffic  represent a vulnerable population from the standpoint of traffic safety  the greatest number of children were injured or killed in road traffic crashes on their way from home to kindergarten or school  mostly due to lack of experience  children s behavior is confusing and often reckless and hasty  safe behavior in the traffic environment demands certain cognitive skills  unlike adults  children have less than fully developed peripheral vision  also  changes occur in color perception  i e  discrimination  all this leads to the conclusion that the stage of physical and mental development of the child is very important for safe participation in traffic  so  to estimate if they are sufficiently equipped to participate safely in traffic  a sensitive test for young children that may be suitable for their level of cognitive development is required  accordingly  road safety education should be arranged in such a way that considers the child s level of development  as has been shown to be more effective when started at younger ages  play is the most natural and easiest way of learning because it is the lens through which children experience their world  and the world of others  having this in mind  if we want to measure the abilities of a child  and their preparedness for safety participation in traffic  unavoidable is to use non verbal tests  the purpose of this study is to explore primary schooler s spatial  and abilities of color perception and memorization  as well as their performances in interpreting the meaning of traffic signs  in addition  neighborhood environmental correlates  rural urban  and possible individual differences influences on the relationship among these abilities was examined  knowledge about these factors affecting children s safety can be applied to improve relevant intervention measures for promoting safe participation of young children in traffic  it may constitute the basis for effective classroom work which implies the creation of individualized educational plans and programs  through which road safety skills could be acquired and adopted through play   c  2017 elsevier ltd  all rights reserved  
 the influence of age related health difficulties and attitudes toward driving on driving self regulation in the baby boomer and older adult generations our study aimed to determine how age and disease related difficulties were associated with attitudes and beliefs about driving self regulation in men and women in the baby boomer and older generations  three hundred and ninety nine men  n  204  and women  n 195  aged between 48 and 91 years participated in a cross sectional study of australian drivers  demographic characteristics and measures of driving confidence  driving difficulty and driving self regulation  perceptions of visual  physical and cognitive capacity  and attitudes and beliefs about driving were obtained  driving self regulation in men and women was explained by different mechanisms  for men  self report of visual and cognitive difficulties and poor driving confidence predicted driving self regulation  for women  negative attitudes toward driving mediated the associations found between health related difficulties and driving self regulation  barriers to driving self regulation were not associated with the driving self regulatory practices of men or women  regardless of generation  women reported poorer driving confidence  greater driving difficulty and more driving self regulation than men  we concluded that age and disease related difficulties are related to increasing driving self regulation in mature men and women  these results indicate that different pathways are needed in models of driving self regulation for men and women regardless of generational cohort   c  2017 elsevier ltd  all rights reserved  
 the influence of built environment on travel behavior of the elderly in urban china along with the aging trend of the world population  the status and determinants of the travel behavior of the elderly have been gaining more attention in planning and research  most of the existing research has focused on the influence of socio demographics and built environments  while the impact of socio cultural backgrounds has attracted less attention  regarding the influence of built environments  previous studies have mainly focused on general elements such as density  and land use mixture  while specifics about how built environments influence the elderly have largely been ignored  this paper  therefore  attempts to investigate how socio cultural settings  interacting with built environments  affect the travel behavior of the elderly in urban china  particularly  we will examine the impacts of a set of built environment attributes on daily activity participation and the travel distance of the elderly in nanjing  based on quantitative and qualitative data  we found that special social and cultural contexts make the travel pattern of chinese elderly and the determinants of that pattern different from those of their western counterparts  specifically  it was found that public transportation accessibility instead of auto transportation accessibility  vegetable markets instead of supermarkets and convenience stores  open spaces and parks along with chess and card rooms instead of gyms and sports centers are more decisive in affecting the travel behavior of the elderly  these findings offer insights for policy making on distributing appropriate public facilities for the elderly in urban areas  especially in new towns in urban china   c  2016 elsevier ltd  all rights reserved  
 the influence of crime on active   sustainable travel  new geo statistical methods and theories for understanding crime and mode choice while several studies investigate the links between crime and travel behavior  little research examines the influence different types of crime or their location may have on active and sustainable travel choices  furthermore  while travel is an inherently linear activity  most studies use coarse  zonal averages  likely missing key details important to pedestrians and bicyclists  in response  this study applies new geospatial measures and statistical methods to explore a number of interesting relationships between different crime types  their location  and their varying influence on green and healthy transit station access mode choices  building on their previous work  the researchers uncover a complex set of relationships  accordingly  this study suggests a new transportation research phenomena the distinction between  property  and  exposed  modes  for example  property crimes appear to deter people from placing personal property at risk  such as parking a vehicle or a bicycle at a station  while violent crimes appear to significantly deter people from choosing to walk or bicycle  potentially exposing themselves to threats of personal injury  our findings suggest that providing greater security for property modes at destinations  e g  secure bicycle parking at stations   and personal safety for exposed modes  e g  crime prevention through environmental design   may provide greater environmental and public health benefits than previously realized  this research infers important links between crime  policing  public health  and sustainability  informing a range of policy decisions  from urban design to police resource allocation  as most public policy and design strategies can take years to show results  this research helps guide crime intervention policies that may more quickly achieve important  health and sustainability goals  
 the influence of functional health on seniors  driving risk driving safety is important for the growing population of seniors  as driving remains their primary mode of travel in the u s   and declines in functional health are often associated with driving cessation  as some seniors may have limited or inaccurate insight into their own driving capabilities  a set of objectively measured functional health assessments is needed that could help them and other stakeholders to determine fitness to drive  the purpose of the current study was to examine the relationships between senior drivers  functional health and crash risk  this analysis used data from 723 senior drivers enrolled in the second strategic highway research program  shop 2  naturalistic driving study  nds   participants  functional health capabilities were measured using 58 metrics encompassing cognitive  perceptual  physical  psychomotor  and psychological abilities as well as driving knowledge  the mileage driven and crashes were identified from objective nds data  twenty two of the metrics were statistically significantly associated with crash risk  deteriorated functional health was uniformally associated with increased crash rate  these findings provide key information to support the development of a battery of functional assessments for senior drivers who may need to have fitness to drive screening  
 the influence of location  socioeconomics  and behaviour on travel demand by car in metropolitan university campuses metropolitan university campuses are unique places usually connected to cities and towns by motorised transport infrastructures  originating an intense travel demand by car  this has triggered a growing concern about how policy action can be more effective to achieve sustainable mobility patterns  this paper aims to gain insight into how factors associated with what we term here as the  3ss  approach  spatial location  socioeconomics and social behaviour  are influencing travel demand by car in the context of metropolitan university campuses  the daily mobility in the metropolitan campus of the autonomous university of barcelona  uab  in greater barcelona  spain  provides the empirical focus  the obtained results explained the multifactorial origin of travel demand by car in the case study  first  it was seen how the age of the university mobile population and their weekly attendance at the uab campus were key factors in understanding the choice of taking a car in daily mobility  second  statistical correlations were seen between car weekly km travelled by the university mobile population and factors such as gender  age  daily stay at the uab campus  and distance to the uab campus  the study also provides autonomous university of barcelona an excellent platform to reflect upon the elaboration of integrated transport policy packages   c  2017 elsevier ltd  all rights reserved  
 the influence of social psychological factors on the intention to choose low carbon travel modes in tianjin  china this paper explores the relationships between travelers  intentions to use low carbon travel modes  a set of socio psychological variables  and the influence of government supported low carbon travel policies  specifically  a comprehensive intention determination model  cidm  is used to study residents  low carbon travel intentions  based on the theory of planned behavior  tpb  and value belief norm theory  vbn   and using structural equations modeling  sem  applied to survey responses by 811 residents of the city of tianjin  china  low carbon transport policies are shown to influence traveler intentions primarily through attitude  subjective and personal norms  awareness of consequence  and ascription of responsibility  and that combining positive social psychological factors towards low carbon awareness with effective low carbon transport policies can influence the residents  willingness to choose low carbon travel modes to a moderate degree  
 the influence of tyres on the use of the cpx method for evaluating the effectiveness of a noise mitigation action based on low noise road surfaces the usage of tow noise road surface can be an important and effective noise mitigation action and  in many cases  it might represent the only viable solution  after the laying of a low noise road surface  it is necessary to verify if the planned objectives have been actually obtained  the close proximity method  cpx  could be a possible method to achieve this result  the current release of the iso 11819 draft regarding cpx redirects to a future third part for all details about the reference tyre to be used  while the previous one gave indications on dimensions  kind of tread pattern and maintenance conditions  as well known  tyre dimensions and tread pattern are the main sources of variability of rolling noise  even though many tyres available on the market comply with all iso requirements  the choice of a brand or a model rather than another one could nevertheless influence results of measurements  in this work  results obtained in several measurement sessions  repeated using different tyres  are compared  aiming to analyse the influence of the tyre choice in assessing the acoustic performance of a low noise road surface  limitations and advantages of the cpx method in regards to the evaluation of the effectiveness of a noise mitigation action are reported  and new perspectives are suggested  in order to improve the relationship with the noise level reduction at the receiver   c  2017 elsevier ltd  all rights reserved  
 the insider  a planners  perspective on accessibility accessibility  the ease of reaching destinations  is a key land use and transportation performance measure that has been studied for decades by researchers  nevertheless  its use by practitioners is generally limited  the goal of this study is to explore the challenges and opportunities experienced by land use and transportation practitioners to use accessibility metrics in their work  in order to achieve this objective  a survey on the use of accessibility metrics was conducted among 343 practitioners around the world  findings from the survey show a gap between knowledge of the concept of accessibility and its use by land use and transportation practitioners  while 90  of the respondents are familiar with the concept  only 55  stated that they use accessibility metrics in their work  whereas lack of support and interest does not appear to be a major obstacle to using accessibility metrics  lack of knowledge and data are highlighted as the main barriers to the use of metrics in practice  these results suggest that further training and collaboration is required to support the use of metrics by practitioners  furthermore  including clear accessibility indicators in planning documents is key to promoting the use of metrics in policy and practice  as it was stated as a main reason motivating the generation of accessibility metrics  this research highlights potential avenues to support the integration of accessibility metrics in practice and is of relevance to researchers  planners and policy makers wishing to foster accessibility based planning approaches  
 the integrated transport and health impact modeling tool in nashville  tennessee  usa  implementation steps and lessons learned the integrated transport and health impact model  ithim  is a comprehensive tool that estimates the hypothetical health effects of transportation mode shifts through changes to physical activity  air pollution  and injuries  the purpose of this paper is to describe the implementation of ithim in greater nashville  tennessee  usa   describe important lessons learned  and serve as an implementation guide for other practitioners and researchers interested in running ithim  as might be expected in other metropolitan areas in the us  not all the required calibration data was available locally  we utilized data from local  state  and federal sources to fulfill the 14 ithim calibration items  which include disease burdens  travel habits  physical activity participation  air pollution levels  and traffic injuries and fatalities  three scenarios were developed that modeled stepwise increases in walking and bicycling  and one that modeled reductions in car travel  cost savings estimates were calculated by scaling national level  disease specific direct treatment costs and indirect lost productivity costs to the greater nashville population of approximately 1 5 million  implementation required approximately one year of intermittent  part time work  across the range of scenarios  results suggested that 24 123 deaths per year could be averted in the region through a 1 5  reduction in the burden of several chronic diseases  this translated into  10  63 million in estimated direct and indirect cost savings per year  implementing ithim in greater nashville has provided local decision makers with important information on the potential health effects of transportation choices  other jurisdictions interested in ithim might find the nashville example as a useful guide to streamline the effort required to calibrate and run the model  published by elsevier ltd  
 the integrated workload scale   translation and validation of a subjective workload scale the integrated workload scale  iws  is a scale for the assessment of subjective workload in real time that was specifically designed for use with train traffic controllers  the iws has nine anchor points that describe the degree of workload   ranging from not demanding  to work too demanding    and captures the multi dimensionality of workload by incorporating items that reflect time  demand and effort  in this paper  we describe how we translated the iws into dutch and subsequently validated the translation by having english language students  dutch students and dutch train traffic controllers rate the individual items of the iws according to the amount of workload each item conveyed  on a scale ranging from 0  no workload at all   to 150  complete overload    a comparison between the ratings of the english and dutch items showed no significant differences  suggesting that the english and dutch versions of the iws are perceived similarly  moreover  a comparison between the dutch students and train traffic controllers also showed no apparent differences in the items  ratings  regression analyses showed a strong linear component reflecting that the items were roughly equidistant on the rating scale  in a final analysis  alternate translations were tested as possible substitutes for some of the original items  but were not considered to substantially improve the scale  in sum  the similarity of the dutch iws to the original iws  as well as the fact that train traffic controllers and students gave similar ratings on the dutch iws  suggest that it is a robust and reliable tool for subjective workload assessment across different populations and that it can be reliably translated to other languages  
 the intention to adopt electric vehicles  driven by functional and non functional values this study aims to investigate consumers  intention to adopt electric vehicles  evs  from the consumption value perspective  drawing from consumption value theory  consumers  value perceptions of evs are classified into functional values  monetary  performance and convenience values  and non functional values  emotional  social and epistemic values   we try to explore how consumers  intention to adopt evs is affected by these two groups of values and how such effects are mediated by their attitude towards evs  via a survey of car drivers in hefei  china  607 responses were obtained to empirically test the relationships  the results indicate that the perceived functional value have both direct and indirect effects on consumers  intention to adopt evs  while the perceived non functional value have only indirect effects on the adoption intention  which is mediated by attitude  this research deepens the existing understanding of consumers  multi dimensional value perceptions towards evs  in practice  the findings could provide sensible guidelines for making the marketing strategies and offer references for policy makers to enhance the operability and pertinence of current policies   c  2017 elsevier ltd  all rights reserved  
 the interactions between e shopping and store shopping in the shopping process for search goods and experience goods when exploring the interactions between e shopping and store shopping  most empirical studies regarded shopping as a transaction  but did not consider internet use in other stages of the shopping process  which has transportation implications  few studies have conducted comparative analyses between different types of products  using 952 internet users in two cities in northern california  this study explores the interactions in the shopping process for two types of products  search goods and experience goods  we find that for internet buyers  clothing is more likely than books to be associated with store visiting for both information search and product trial  online pre purchase behaviors were more likely to facilitate cross channel shopping than those at a store  a comparison with an earlier study shows more similarities than differences between the two studies  suggesting a certain amount of spatio temporal generalizability of relationships  
 the learning process of accessibility instrument developers  testing the tools in planning practice many planning support tools have recently been developed aimed at measuring and modelling accessibility  accessibility instrument or al   the main difficulty for tool developers is designing an ai that is at the same time technically rigorous and usable in practice  measuring accessibility is indeed a complex task  and ai outputs are difficult to communicate to target end users  in particular  because these users are professionals from several disciplines with different languages and areas of expertise  such as urban geographers  spatial planners  transport planners  and budgeting professionals  in addition to this  ai developers seem to have little awareness of the needs of ai end users  which in turn tend to have limited ability for using these tools  against this complex background  our research focuses on the viewpoint of ai developers  with two aims   1  to provide insights into how ai developers perceive their tools and  2  to understand how their perceptions might change after testing their ai with end users  with this in mind  an analysis of 15 case studies was performed  groups of end users tested different ai in structured workshops  before and after the workshops  two questionnaires explored the al developers  perceptions on the tools and their usability  the paper demonstrates that the workshops with end users were critical for developers to appreciate the importance of specific characteristics the tool should have  namely practical relevance  flexibility  and ease of use  the study provides evidence that ai developers were prone to change their perceptions about ai after interacting directly with end users   c  2017 elsevier ltd  all rights reserved  
 the local economic impacts of high speed railways  theories and facts introduction elected officials and practitioners generally believe that   along with gains in time  environment  and roadway safety   the local economic impacts brought by high speed railways  hsr  could be a major ingredient in socioeconomic appraisals  however  academic studies have shown mixed results  methods this article reviews the various channels through which hsr may impact the local economies  we break down the economic effects by stages of the projects  lifetime and we question the existence of these impacts with an eye towards empirical evidence from the abundant academic and  grey  literature  results outside the  construction effects   that constitute a broad consensus  studies find both the existence and the absence of impacts of hsr  whether these are short term effects on local productivity and the geography of consumption  through tourism or extended stays  or long term effects on the relocation of businesses and households and ultimately local growth patterns  results show great variability as economic effects are conditional upon a set of other factors such as city size  industry structures  amenities  and distance from the urban core  conclusions the main difficulty is being able to identify empirically to what extent new infrastructures have affected variations observed in the field  and not the opposite  we believe that making progress on these questions requires clarifying which model of local development is to be used and what kind of development is the goal of public policy  
 the location of late night bars and alcohol related crashes in houston  texas a study in the city of houston  texas  related the location of establishments primarily serving alcohol   bars   after midnight to late night alcohol related motor vehicle crashes  there were three data sets for 2007 09  1  764 bars that were open after midnight  2  1660 alcohol related crashes that occurred within the city of houston between midnight and 6 am  and 3  4689 modeling network road segments to which bars and alcohol related crashes were assigned  forty five percent of the late night alcohol related crashes were within a quarter mile of a late night bar  the bars were highly concentrated in 17 small bar clusters  using the modeling network  poisson gamma car and poisson lognormal car spatial regression models showed a positive exponential relationship between late night alcohol related crashes and the number of late nights bars and bar clusters  and a negative exponential relationship to distance to the nearest late night bar controlling for the type of road segment  freeway  principal arterial  minor arterial   a more general model dropped the bar cluster variable  further  the poisson gamma car model appeared to produce a better representation than the poisson lognormal car model though the errors were different  the general poisson gamma car model showed that each late night bar increased the frequency of alcohol related crashes on a segment by approximately 190   for each mile closer a segment was to a late night bar  the likelihood increased by 42   
 the many reasons your mileage may vary  toward a unifying typology of eco driving behaviors the role of vehicle driver behavior has been ignored in prior energy and environmental policy making  laboratory procedures that produce the fuel economy estimates posted on every new car sold in the us are designed to preclude the effects of differences between drivers  yet  every vehicle states the caveat   actual results will vary for many reasons  including driving conditions and how you drive and maintain your vehicle   eco driving as means of strategically taking advantage of this variability has been inconsistently defined in conceptual analyses and variously operationalized in empirical analyses  the present research clarifies  synthesizes  and expands on prior definitions of eco driving to develop a comprehensive and precise definition and typology of eco driving behaviors  the resultant typology includes six mutually exclusive classes of behavior  driving  cabin comfort  trip planning  load management  fueling  and maintenance  this typology establishes a basis for systematic research to determine energy and climate impacts and develop effective policies and interventions for different types of eco driving   c  2017 elsevier ltd  all rights reserved  
 the meaning of livable streets to schoolchildren  an image mapping study of the effects of traffic on children s cognitive development of spatial knowledge while much focus has been placed on the physical activity and environmental benefits of providing safe and livable streets for children  few studies look at the mental health and cognitive development benefits from lowering children s exposure to threats from traffic  in response  this study uses innovative cognitive mapping methods through a series of focus group interviews with nine and ten year schoolchildren to uncover important ways traffic exposure limits children s cognitive development of their spatial knowledge  to test for these effects  this study focuses on schoolchildren in two similar suburban neighborhoods and schools in suburbs in the san francisco bay area  but differing in the volume and speed of traffic the students are exposed to during their journeys to and from school  the cognitive mapping exercises and methods used in this research reveal multi dimensional effects  including how exposure to traffic  as determined by volume  speed  and the adequacy of walking and bicycling infrastructure  limits children s progression along a cognitive development continuum of spatial knowledge  specifically  the results show that without adequate pedestrian and bicycle facilities to provide sanctuary from automobile traffic  children are overcome by the negative senses of danger and dislike  commensurate with a limited ability to identify qualities of their neighborhood that are memorable  special  or even positive  in contrast  this study finds that children allowed to have higher levels of interaction with the environment  through independent  active travel modes improve their spatial knowledge development  by making neighborhood streets safe  comfortable  and livable  this research establishes some key psychological cognitive benefits associated with lowering a child s exposure to automobile traffic by providing adequate pedestrian and bicycle safe routes to school  sr2s  infrastructure   graphics   c  2017 published by elsevier ltd  
 the multi port berth allocation problem with speed optimization and emission considerations the container shipping industry faces many interrelated challenges and opportunities  as its role in the global trading system has become increasingly important over the last decades  on the one side  collaboration between port terminals and shipping liners can lead to costs savings and help achieve a sustainable supply chain  and on the other side  the optimization of operations and sailing times leads to reductions in bunker consumption and  thus  to fuel cost and air emissions reductions  to that effect  there is an increasing need to address the integration opportunities and environmental issues related to container shipping through optimization  this paper focuses on the well known berth allocation problem  bap   an optimization problem assigning berthing times and positions to vessels in container terminals  we introduce a novel mathematical formulation that extends the classical bap to cover multiple ports in a shipping network under the assumption of strong cooperation between shipping lines and terminals  speed is optimized on all sailing legs between ports  demonstrating the effect of speed optimization in reducing the total time of the operation  as well as total fuel consumption and emissions  furthermore  the model implementation shows that an accurate speed discretization can result in far better economic and environmental results   c  2017 elsevier ltd  all rights reserved  
 the need for detailed gender specific occupational safety analysis introduction  the female work in population is growing in the united states  therefore the occupational health and safety entities must start to analyze gender specific data related to every industry  especially to nontraditional occupations  women working in nontraditional jobs are often exposed to extreme workplace hazards  these women have their safety and health threatened because there are no adequate policies to mitigate gender specific risks such as discrimination and harassment  employers tend to aggravate this situation because they often fail to provide proper reporting infrastructure and support  according to past studies  women suffered from workplace injuries and illnesses that were less prominent among men  statistics also confirmed that men and women faced different levels of risks in distinct work environments  for example  the rates of workplace violence and murders by personal acquaintances were significantly higher among women  methods  in this paper  the authors analyze prior public data on fatal and nonfatal injuries to understand why we need to differentiate genders when analyzing occupational safety and health issues  results  the analyses confirmed that women dealt with unique workplace hazards compared to men  conclusions  it is urgent that public agencies  such as the u s  department of labor  record gender specific data in details and by occupations and industries  practical application  the reader will become aware of the current lack  and need   of data and knowledge about injuries and illnesses separated by gender and industry  finally  safety and health researchers are encouraged to investigate the gender   specific data in all industries and occupations  as soon as they become available   c  2017 national safety council and elsevier ltd  all rights reserved  
 the new public transport pricing in madrid metropolitan area  a welfare analysis in a context of economic crisis  the amount of the demand public transport subsidies in madrid has been reduced to control the level of public deficit  this has implied a worsening of public service quality and an increase of public transport prices  using the spanish household survey  this paper analyses the impact on welfare generated by the increase of public transport prices in 2008 2012  for this price and income elasticities have been computed using an la aids model  price public transport elasticities are low  around 0 1   and only significant for the years of the highest price increase  fuel is substitutive for public transport with a cross price elasticity of 0 25  and the other goods consumption is almost independent of the consumption of public transport with a cross price elasticity of 0 06   the results of income elasticies prove that public transport is a normal good  results show that this new policy has harmed with a similar impact  low and medium income households  those households have supported an average loss of welfare of 3 66  of their income  the welfare loss supported by the richest households is 1 5  of their income  which represents only a 40  of the average costs supported by the rest of households   c  2017 elsevier ltd  all rights reserved  
 the other side of an airport s two sided market  issues in planning and pricing airport surface access the first part of the paper considers the two sided nature of airport platforms  and argues that on the land side  analysis and policy has generally over stated the items that should be included  in this context  the paper s focus is on airport access and how it should be embraced  along with airside considerations  in a two sided framework when establishing prices and investment  in the second part  the more theoretical argument is juxta positioned with prior empirical analysis of landside access which has largely been treated in a rather ad hoc way  usually implicitly assuming it involves a one sided market  the subsequent arguments of what needs to be done  are suggestive rather than specific given the diverse institutional and physical nature of airports and their surroundings  
 the performance of dutch train drivers based on the impact of the presence of a second person in the cab insufficient attention allocation of train drivers towards the driving task impairs the driving performance and increases the risk of signals passed at danger  this pilot study explores the performance and attention allocation of train drivers based on the impact of the behaviour of another person present in the driver s cab  a method that uses a train simulator has been developed to assess the attention allocation and task performance for routes with different complexity levels and for conditions when train drivers were driving alone  with a person present who was considerate of the driving task or with a person who was not  the presence of a non considerate person in the cabin has a negative impact on the driving performance  tasks were completed successfully more often when driving alone  train drivers interrupted conversations more often to focus on driving on routes with high complexity  which indicates that conversations increased the workload  an increase in the conversation frequency had a negative impact on the accuracy of speed monitoring  participants indicated that the driving performance improved as a result of participating in the experiment on the awareness of the impact of another person s presence in the cab  it is anticipated that the findings of this pilot study and further works will provide more understanding about the factors that are important to the performance of train drivers and the improvement of railway safety  
 the potential for the development of carsharing and carpooling systems  a survey based analysis of university students in poland shared mobility services are developing dynamically in countries of central and eastern europe   such as poland and other young market economies as well  in this study  we explore the issue of carsharing and carpooling systems development potential among university students in poland a fast growing economy with a pro car mobility culture  in spring 2016  452 surveys were collected from universities in nine cities in poland  the study was aimed at university students  which means mostly people of 18 24 years of age  the study was conducted with the use of the cawi method  the questionnaire was published on line and disseminated among university students in selected major cities in poland  the findings indicate that there is a place for shared mobility schemes in the polish market  but presently  there is very scant awareness of such solutions  there are many barriers to carsharing and carpooling development  mainly due to the fact that the car is a symbol of freedom and independence  as well as a mark of social status worth spending money on  especially for young people such as university students  previous studies have focused mainly on highly developed economies  with large  densely populated cities  where the shared mobility schemes have existed for many years and already are a part of transport policy  the results of this study may be used by the local and regional authorities in developing economies  so that the shared mobility schemes could become a part of urban transport systems  
 the pricing responses of non bag fee airlines to the use of bag fees in the us air travel market using a panel data for southwest and jetblue in the 1st quarter of 2009  2011  and 2013  we develop an empirical study and find evidence suggesting that the amount of bag fee charged by bag fee airlines  including those direct rivals at the route level and indirect rivals competing from adjacent airports  has a positive and significant effect on the airfare of non bag fee airlines and such a positive association is smaller on vacation oriented routes  but greater on routes with higher per capita income at endpoint cities  moreover  the results are found that on the routes where southwest is the only non bag fee airline  the amount of bag fee charged by other airlines has a positive and significant effect on the traffic volume of southwest  this traffic increasing effect  however  may be offset by the higher airfare of southwest in response to other airlines  imposition of bag fees   c  2017 elsevier ltd  all rights reserved  
 the prospects of fare free public transport  evidence from tallinn the subsidy level of public transport systems varies considerably among systems worldwide  while limited scale free fare public transport  ffpt  services such as limited campaigns and fare evasion for special groups or specific services are prevalent  there is only limited evidence on the consequences of introducing a full fledged ffpt  the case of tallinn  estonia offers a full scale experiment that provides a unique opportunity to investigate the impacts of ffpt  this study examines travel pattern changes based on individual travel habit survey shortly before and almost 1 year after the introduction of ffpt policy in tallinn based on interviews and travel diaries of a random sample of 1500 household  we analyse modal shift effects and whether they are driven by trip generation or trip substitution  travel attitudes and satisfactions as well as impacts on equity  employment prospects  and trip destination choices  almost a year after the introduction of ffpt  public transport usage increased by 14   and there is evidence that the mobility of low income residents has improved  the effect of ffpt on ridership is substantially lower than those reported in previous studies due to the good level of service provision  high public transport usage and low public transport fees that existed already prior to the ffpt  
 the q ad hoc hub location problem for multi modal networks this research proposes a spatial optimization problem over a multi modal transportation network  termed the q ad hoc hub location problem  ahlp   to utilize alternative hubs in an ad hoc manner in the wake of a hub outage  the model aims to reorganize the spatial structure of disrupted networks  unaffected hubs are utilized as ad hoc hubs through which alternative routes connect supply and demand nodes  as a case study  the ahlp is applied to a multi modal freight transport system connecting international destinations with the united states  the models are utilized to establish a new ranking methodology for critical infrastructure by combining metrics capturing nodal criticality and network resilience and recuperability  the results show that the ahlp is both an effective and practical recovery approach for a hub network to respond to the potential disruptions of hubs and a novel methodology for ranking critical infrastructure  
 the quality of cruise companies  mission statements  a content analysis consistently with extant management literature  a high quality mission statement is crucial for formulating  implementing and evaluating business strategy  despite the considerable attention awarded to this theme  the role and quality of mission statements in the strategic management of tourism firms has not been sufficiently highlighted  the present paper aims therefore at bridging this literature gap  by assessing the quality of cruise line mission statements  considering that  to the best of our knowledge  a relevant systematic study does not exist yet  we employ three measures of  quality  derived from previous literature   1  inclusion of stakeholder groups   2  mention of specific  mission  components  target customers segments  products  location  technology  concern for survival  philosophy  self concept  concern for public image  concern for employees    3  reference to the four goals assigned to mission statements  disclosure of the sense of future direction  definition of control mechanism  decision making guide  and a motivation tool for employees  we apply the content analysis methods to analyze the mission statements of 44 cruise lines operating in the standard ocean and luxury niche market segments  the results suggest that the statements fall short of meeting the quality criteria suggested by the academic literature  variations from the  ideal  and high quality missions are discussed  limited differences also emerge between firms belonging to the two cruise market segments  this contribution presents some valuable research implications  useful for researchers and academics  but also professionals and investors may benefit from this knowledge  
 the relationship between airport performance and privatisation policy  a nonparametric metafrontier approach the assessment of economic and technical efficiency is a useful tool for selecting the most appropriate technology for airport operations  however  traditional models require that the units being assessed operate with the same technology  to overcome this limitation  one can use a non concave metafrontier approach that is based on data envelopment analysis  dea  to calculate the techno economic efficiency and technological gap ratios  tgrs  with non homogeneous technologies for airports across countries and with different ownerships  the previous studies mainly applied dea to measure the operational efficiency of airports  our results indicate that privately owned airports have better technical efficiency than public ones  in addition  our empirical analysis shows that public airports in the asia pacific area have the lowest techno economic efficiency  
 the relationship between cell phone use and management of driver fatigue  it s complicated introduction  voice communication may enhance performance during monotonous  potentially fatiguing driving conditions  atchley   chan  2011   however  it is unclear whether safety benefits of conversation are outweighed by costs  the present study tested whether personalized conversations intended to simulate hands free cell phone conversation may counter objective and subjective fatigue effects elicited by vehicle automation  method  a passive fatigue state  desmond   hancock  2001   characterized by disengagement from the task  was induced using full vehicle automation prior to drivers resuming full control over the driving simulator  a conversation was initiated shortly after reversion to manual control  during the conversation an emergency event occurred  results  the fatigue manipulation produced greater task disengagement and slower response to the emergency event  relative to a control condition  conversation did not mitigate passive fatigue effects  rather  it added worry about matters unrelated to the driving task  conversation moderately improved vehicle control  as measured by sdlp  but it failed to counter fatigue induced slowing of braking in response to an emergency event  finally  conversation appeared to have a hidden danger in that it reduced drivers  insights into performance impairments when in a state of passive fatigue  conclusions  automation induced passive fatigue  indicated by loss of task engagement  yet  simulated cell phone conversation did not counter the subjective automation induced fatigue  conversation also failed to counter objective loss of performance  slower braking speed  resulting from automation  cell phone conversation in passive fatigue states may impair drivers  awareness of their performance deficits  practical applications  results suggest that conversation  even using a hands free device  may not be a safe way to reduce fatigue and increase alertness during transitions from automated to manual vehicle control   c  2017 national safety council and elsevier ltd  all rights reserved  
 the relationship between motorcycle rider scores and crashes for riders in australia motorcycle riders are over represented in road fatalities in australia  while riders represent 18  of the road users killed each year  motorcycle registrations constitute only 4 5  of the registered vehicle fleet  the motorcycle rider behaviour questionnaire  mrbq  was developed with a view toward understanding behaviours likely to be associated with crash risk  these include behaviours that are either intentional  such as violations of road and speed regulations and stunts  or unintentional  such as errors relating to traffic or control of the motorcycle   as well as protective behaviours related to use of safety equipment  the dual aims of the current study were  first  to determine the appropriate structure of a modified version of the mrbq for use in a representative sample of riders in australia and  second  to understand which mrbq factors are associated with crash involvement  a stratified sampling procedure was undertaken to ensure the socio economic status of local government area  age and gender of the sample was representative of the broader population of riders in new south wales  australia  the sample consisted of 470 riders  males   89    exploratory factor analysis revealed a 29 item  five factor structure was suitable on the australian data encompassing traffic errors  speed violations  protective gear  control errors and stunts  overall  riders reported relatively safe behaviours  with frequent use of protective gear and infrequent aberrant behaviours  however  even though infrequent  violations of speed and errors related to control of the motorcycle increased the odds of near crash involvement  whilst stunt behaviours were associated with increased odds of crash involvement  interventions and countermeasures need to target these specific behaviours   c  2017 elsevier ltd  all rights reserved  
 the relationship between patient safety climate and occupational safety climate in healthcare   a multi level investigation introduction  patient safety climate culture is attracting increasing research interest  but there is little research on its relation with organizational climates regarding other target domains  the aim of this study was to investigate the relationship between patient safety climate and occupational safety climate in healthcare  method  the climates were assessed using two questionnaires  hospital survey on patient safety culture and nordic occupational safety climate questionnaire  the final sample consisted of 1154 nurses  886 assistant nurses  and 324 physicians  organized in 150 work units  within hospitals  117 units   primary healthcare  5 units  and elderly care  28 units  in western sweden  which represented 56  of the original sample contacted  results  within each type of safety climate  two global dimensions were confirmed in a higher order factor analysis  one with an external focus relative the own unit  and one with an internal focus  two methods were used to estimate the covariation between the global climate dimensions  in order to minimize the influence of bias from common method variance  first multilevel analysis was used for partitioning variances and covariances in a within unit part  individual level  and a between unit part  unit level   second  a split sample technique was used to calculate unit level correlations based on aggregated observations from different respondents  both methods showed associations similar in strength between the patient safety climate and the occupational safety climate domains  conclusions  the results indicated that patient safety climate and occupational safety climate are strongly positively related at the unit level  and that the same organizational processes may be important for the development of both types of organizational climate  practical applications  safety improvement interventions should not be separated in different organizational processes  but be planned so that both patient safety and staff safety are considered concomitantly   c  2017 national safety council and elsevier ltd  all rights reserved

 the role of parental risk judgements  transport safety attitudes  transport priorities and accident experiences on pupils  walking to school walking to school could improve pupils  health condition and might also reduce the use of motorized transport modes  which leads to both traffic congestion and air pollution  the current study aims to examine the role of parental risk judgements  i e  risk perception and worry   transport safety attitudes  transport priorities and accident experiences on pupils  walking and mode choices on school trips in iran  a country with poor road safety records  a total of 1078 questionnaires were randomly distributed among pupils at nine public and private schools in january 2014 in rasht  iran  results from valid observations  n   711  showed that parents with high probability assessments of accidents and strong worry regarding pupils  accident risk while walking were less likely to let their children walk to school  parents with high safety knowledge were also more likely to allow their pupils to walk to school  parents who prioritized convenience and accessibility in transport had a stronger tendency to choose motorized modes over walking modes  also  parents who prioritized safety and security in transport were less likely to allow pupils to walk to school  elasticities results showed that a one percent increase in priorities of convenience and accessibility  priorities of safety and security  car ownership and walking time from home to school reduced walking among pupils by a probability of 0 62  0 20  0 86 and 0 57   respectively  a one percent increase in parental safety knowledge increased the walking probability by around 0 25   a 1 unit increase in parental probability assessment and worry towards pupils  walking  decreased the probability of choosing walking mode by 0 11 and 0 05  respectively  policy makers who aim to promote walking to schools should improve safety and security of the walking facilities and increase parental safety knowledge   c  2017 elsevier ltd  all rights reserved  
 the role of social networks in supporting the travel needs of people after serious traumatic injury  a nested qualitative study this study explores the importance of social networks and transport for people who had experienced a traumatic injury three years earlier  many participants found travelling difficult because of pain  discomfort  fatigue and mobility impairments caused by their injuries which led them to be highly dependent on being a passenger in cars driven by others  or on public transport and taxis  to meet their travels needs  after injury  participants  needs to travel were often high because they had to attend regular medical and physiotherapy appointments  they also needed to be able to travel to reengage with social activities  for those who used public transport or taxis  new challenges were faced in terms of the preplanning  lack of accessibility and availability of these modes  participants that lived in rural areas with infrequent public transport keenly felt their dependence on others for transport as did those who were wheelchair dependent where car based travel was the only option  participants described their dependence on others for travel as feeling they were a burden  for some participants their social network could not help with travel  this meant that they either did not travel or had to absorb the costs of taxis  practical support from the transport accident commission compensation scheme in terms of taxi vouchers were useful and appreciated  however  the service provided by taxis was perceived as costly and  at times  described as unreliable and unsafe  there were many hidden costs related to supporting the travel needs of injured people  participants who could not travel and reengage with social activities felt emotionally low  isolated and vulnerable  service providers need to consider injured people s ability to access support for travel  the availability of accessible transport and help with travel costs in order to support their physical and psychological recovery  
 the role of the market potential in the port choice process  a case study according to the theoretical postulates of the new economic geography  the ability of ports to attract traffic from the economic activity centres should be influenced by their geographical location regarding them  the aim of this paper is to test that hypothesis through the spanish case study by introducing the concept of market potential in the analysis  for this purpose a double perspective is used  that of the province where the port is located and that of the province where the traffic is generated  the obtained results validate the stated hypothesis and open the door to very interesting queries about the planning of both the infrastructure map and the regional economic policy  
 the safe range inventory  sri   an assistance tool for optimizing the charging infrastructure for electric vehicles electric vehicles  evs  are propagated as an essential solution for reducing the carbon footprint of traffic activities  one essential barrier to the adoption of electromobility strategies in everyday life is the very limited driving range of typical evs  a dense and reliable network of electric charging stations would enable safer and longer ranges  modern fast charging technologies provide additional possibilities to tactically and quickly re charge evs  but high implementation costs make it necessary to establish a mixed infrastructure consisting of cheap but slow and expensive but fast charging stations  we utilized the so called safe range inventory  sri   a multidimensional assessment tool for capturing multi facets of subjective range safety assessments  using scenarios with different infrastructure settings  we revealed that the addition of just one fast charging option drastically lowers range anxiety even under relatively short emergency range conditions  additional fast charging options did not have strong positive effects on the assessments but would amass very high costs  the sri can assist in the planning of electric charging infrastructures in order to find the right balance between range safety and installation and maintenance costs   c  2017 elsevier ltd  all rights reserved

 the san francisco travel quality study  tracking trials and tribulations of a transit taker in helping understand the dynamics of travel choice behavior and traveler satisfaction over time  multi day panel data is invaluable  mcfadden in am econ rev 91 3   351 378  2001   the collection of such data has become increasingly feasible thanks to smartphones  which researchers can use to present surveys to travelers and to collect additional information through the phones  location services and other sensors  this paper describes the design and implementation of the san francisco travel quality study  a multi day research study conducted in autumn 2013 with 838 participants  the objective of the study was to investigate the link between transit service quality  the satisfaction and subjective well being of transit riders  and travel choice behavior  with a particular interest in the influence of travelers  choice history and personal experiences on future transit use  for that purpose  a rich panel data set was collected from multiple sources  including a number of mobile travel experience surveys capturing traveler satisfaction and emotions  two online surveys capturing demographics  attitudes and mode choice intentions  as well as high resolution phone location data and transit vehicle location data  by fusing the phone location data with transit vehicle location data  individual level transit travel diaries could be automatically created  and by fusing the location data with the survey responses  additional information about the context of the responses could be derived  while the behavioral and satisfaction related findings of the study are detailed in other publications  this paper is intended to serve two purposes  first  it describes the study design  data collection effort and challenges faced in order to provide a learning opportunity for other researchers considering similar studies  second  it discusses the key sociodemographic data and characteristics of the study population in order to provide a foundation and reference for further publications that make use of the data set described here  the authors would like to invite other researchers to collaborate with them on the evaluation of the data  
 the severity of driver fatigue in terms of line crossing  a pilot study comparing day  and night time driving in simulator introduction the overall aim of this study is to compare daytime driving with night time driving looking at line crossings during self reported sleepiness and long blinks  the hypothesis is that high levels of self reported sleepiness  kss 9  and long blink duration   0 15 s  will be less associated with critical events during the day time compared to night time  method the study is based on data from a driving simulator experiment with 16 participants driving 150 km on a typical swedish motorway scenario twice  once during daytime and once during night time  in total data from 6 segments of 4 km each equally distributed along the drive was averaged and included in the analysis  a mixed model anova was used to test the effects on kss  blink duration and line crossings with factors for session  day night  and road segment  1 6   and participant as random  in addition  a logistic regression was used to identify when there is a risk for line crossings  finally  the proportion of line crossings in relation to high kss values and long blink durations was tested with fisher s exact test  results the results show no differences in the percentage of line crossings to the left during high levels of karolinska sleepiness scale during daytime  33   compare to night time  40    however  there was a significant difference between day and night time line crossings while the driver had long duration blinks  4  during daytime and 35  during night time   despite these results the most promising predictor of line crossings in each segment of 4 km h was kss with an odds ratio of 5 4 with a reference value at karolinska sleepiness scale level 5  conclusion in conclusion  the results do not support the hypothesis that high levels of kss will result in more frequent line crossings at night time compared to day time  however  the result supports the hypothesis that long blink durations are associated with more line crossings when they appear during night time than during daytime  
 the sex disparity in risky driving  a survey of colombian young drivers objective  the overrepresentation of young drivers in poor road safety outcomes has long been recognized as a global road safety issue  in addition  the overrepresentation of males in crash statistics has been recognized as a pervasive young driver problem  though progress in road safety evidenced as a stabilization and or reduction in poor road safety outcomes has been made in developed nations  less developed nations contribute the greatest road safety trauma  and developing nations such as colombia continue to experience increasing trends in fatality rates  the aim of the research was to explore sex differences in self reported risky driving behaviors of young drivers  including the associations with crash involvement  in a sample of young drivers attending university in colombia methods  the spanish version of the behaviour of young novice drivers scale  bynds sp  was applied in an online survey to a sample of 392 students  225 males  aged 16 24years attending a major university  appropriate comparative statistics and logistic regression modeling were used when analyzing the data results  males reported consistently more risky driving behaviors  with approximately one quarter of all participants reporting risky driving exposure  males reported greater crash involvement  with violations such as speeding associated with crash involvement for both males and females conclusion  young drivers in colombia appear to engage in the same risky driving behaviors as young drivers in developed nations  in addition  young male drivers in colombia reported greater engagement in risky driving behaviors than young female drivers  a finding consistent with the behaviors of young male drivers in developed nations  as such  the research findings suggest that general interventions such as education  engineering  and enforcement should target transient rule violations such as speeding and using a handheld mobile phone while driving for young drivers in colombia  future research should investigate how these interventions could be tailored specifically for the colombian cultural context  including how their effects can be evaluated  prior to implementation

 the state of the residential fire fatality problem in sweden  epidemiology  risk factors  and event typologies introduction  residential fires represent the largest category of fatal fires in sweden  the purpose of this study was to describe the epidemiology of fatal residential fires in sweden and to identify clusters of events  method  data was collected from a database that combines information on fatal fires with data from forensic examinations and the swedish cause of death register  mortality rates were calculated for different strata using population statistics and rescue service turnout reports  cluster analysis was performed using multiple correspondence analysis with agglomerative hierarchical clustering  results  male sex  old age  smoking  and alcohol were identified as risk factors  and the most common primary injury diagnosis was exposure to toxic gases  compared to nonfatal fires  fatal residential fires more often originated in the bedroom  were more often caused by smoking  and were more likely to occur at night  six clusters were identified  the first two clusters were both smoking related  but were separated into  1  fatalities that often involved elderly people  usually female  whose clothes were ignited  17  of the sample    2  middle aged  45 64 years old    often  intoxicated men  where the fire usually originated in furniture  30    other clusters that were identified in the analysis were related to  3  fires caused by technical fault  started in electrical installations in single houses  13     4  cooking appliances left on  8     5  events with unknown cause  room and object of origin  25    and  6  deliberately set fires  7    conclusions  fatal residential fires were unevenly distributed in the swedish population  to further reduce the incidence of fire mortality  specialized prevention efforts that focus on the different needs of each cluster are required  practical applications  cooperation between various societal functions  e g  rescue services  elderly care  psychiatric clinics and other social services  with an application of both human and technological interventions  should reduce residential fire mortality in sweden   c  2017 the authors  national safety council and elsevier ltd  
 the strategic impact of airline group diversification  the cases of emirates and lufthansa the airline industry is a diverse sector  requiring the support of a varied range of ancillary businesses such as maintenance  catering and travel agencies to carry out its activities  many of these supporting businesses demonstrate the potential to drive wider profit margins despite generating lower revenues than the airlines themselves  making them attractive investment opportunities in a sector prone to volatile and often lacklustre trading  this study investigates two of the largest diversified airline groups  germany s lufthansa group and dubai s emirates group  each adopting a distinct approach towards diversification that may serve as a model for airline groups worldwide  the areas investigated were cargo  maintenance  catering and travel services  the research found that whilst diversification may not always present the most attractive option financially  strategic factors can often outweigh such concerns  business units studied were found to have variable prospects  particularly in the case of catering  a sector on the rise versus in house maintenance  which for airlines  is likely to see decline  the pursuit of third party revenue streams to offset weak internal trading and growth in competencies were found to be the key drivers of success  interplay between segments was also apparent  showing that a well organised diversification strategy can achieve robust cross functional benefits and deliver significant value to the parent organisation   c  2016 elsevier ltd  all rights reserved  
 the stretched intersection  a new and unconventional signal design alternative one of the typical intersection improvements is to add more turn lanes  which results in a wider intersection  the wide intersection will increase pedestrian crossing time and crossing distance  thus potentially reducing pedestrian safety  1 it also requires a longer signal phasing clearance time  all red interval   and a longer pedestrian crossing time requires a longer signal phase associated with the crossing  these two requirements may reduce the operational efficiency of the intersection

 time of day effects on railroad roadway worker injury risk introduction  the purpose of this study is to examine how time of day affects injury risk of railroad maintenance of way employees and signalmen  roadway workers   railroads reported 15 654 serious roadway worker injuries between 1997 and 2014  roadway workers primarily work outdoors on or near railroad tracks and frequently encounter hazardous conditions  to avoid closing an active rail line during peak hours  railroads sometimes require roadway workers to work at night  previous studies of roadway worker injury have not adequately accounted for exposure to time of day effects  nor have they investigated the human factors issues contributing to roadway worker injury  method  the federal railroad administration  fra  database of injury reports provided data for circadian rhythm models of the odds of fatal and nonfatal injuries  the fra database and fatal injury investigation reports also permitted an analysis of the circumstances and the human factors issues associated with injuries that occur at different times of day  results  odds of injury increased during nighttime work  the odds of nonfatal injury for both roadway worker crafts rose above 9 1 in the early morning hours  the relative odds of a fatal injury also increased significantly at night  a human factors analysis suggested that during all three shifts most nonfatal injuries involve workload  but workload was not identified as a factor in fatal injuries  conclusions  nighttime work is more hazardous for roadway workers than daytime work  several factors related to fatigue and other conditions appear to increase the risk of injury during the outdoor  nighttime work required of roadway workers  practical application  for practical reasons  nighttime roadway work is sometimes unavoidable  therefore  new practices for nighttime work must be developed to adequately address fatigue and protect roadway workers from harm  published by elsevier ltd  on behalf of national safety council  
 time dependent green vehicle routing problem with stochastic vehicle speeds  an approximate dynamic programming algorithm this paper addresses a time dependent capacitated vehicle routing problem with stochastic vehicle speeds and environmental concerns  the problem has been formulated as a markovian decision process  as distinct from the traditional attempts on the problem  while estimating the amount of fuel consumption and emissions  the model takes time dependency and stochasticity of the vehicle speeds into account  the time dependent capacitated vehicle routing problem is known to be np hard for even deterministic settings  incorporating uncertainty to the problem increases complexity  which renders classical optimization methods infeasible  therefore  we propose an approximate dynamic programming based heuristic as a decision aid tool for the problem  the proposed markovian decision model and approximate dynamic programming based heuristic are flexible in terms that more environmentally friendly solutions can be obtained by changing the objective function from cost minimization to emissions minimization  the added values of the proposed decision support tools have been shown through computational analyses on several instances  the computational analyses show that incorporating vehicle speed stochasticity into decision support models has potential to improve the performance of resulting routes in terms of travel duration  emissions and travel cost  in addition  the proposed heuristic provides promising results within relatively short computation times   c  2017 elsevier ltd  all rights reserved  
 time frequency analysis of the baltic dry index in this paper  the dynamic spectral content of the baltic dry index  bdi  is explored  conventional spectrum analysis  often utilized in economic time series as a complementary tool  provides a static representation of a specific time period  unsuitable for assessing possible frequency shifts over time  recent studies have shown that the daily bdi has a rich spectral content  which has never been explored utilizing the domains of time and frequency simultaneously  this work attempts to supplement the discussion of the bdi cyclical behavior by highlighting its evolving structure through time frequency analysis and contributes to the literature by first  assessing the existence of five distinct cycles within the low frequency band of the bdi  as well as other high frequency components  second  constraining their frequency ranges  and third  capturing their variability through time  as well as possible stylized frequency shifts  the data driven trend removal methodology empirical mode decomposition utilized  improved the interpretability of the time frequency representations  this approach constitutes a framework for capturing frequency periodicity variations and drifts of the bdi  useful for risk reduction for both maritime demand and supply side stakeholders  
 time indexed formulations for the runway scheduling problem the problem of sequencing and scheduling airplanes landing and taking off on a runway is a major challenge for air traffic management  this difficult real time task is still carried out by human controllers  with little help from automatic tools  several methods have been proposed in the literature  including mixed integer programming  mlp  based approaches  however  there is an opinion that mip is unattractive for real time applications  since computation times are likely to grow too large  in this paper  we reverse this claim  by developing a mip approach able to solve to optimality real life instances from congested airports in the stringent times allowed by the application  to achieve this  it was mandatory to identify new classes of strong valid inequalities  along with developing effective fixing and lifting procedures  
 time of day pricing in taxi markets for a regular weekday in new york city  the number of taxi trips at 8 p  m  may be 10 times greater than that at 5 a  m   while passengers are charged under the same pricing scheme  motivated by temporally non stationary demand and supply in the taxi market  the time of day  tod  pricing scheme for taxi industry is framed to vary trip cost dynamically over time  so that total market revenue is maximized  temporal market dynamics is modeled as a semi markov process  which captures leftover of drivers  spillover of passengers  and restoration of drivers in service along the time horizon  the tod pricing scheme is therefore formulated as discrete time stochastic dynamic programming with the goal to find the optimal sequence of price multipliers  the approximate dynamic programming  adp  approach is introduced to solve the curse of dimensionality  numerical experiments are conducted using new york city taxi trip data to illustrate the effectiveness of tod price in real world taxi market  the results suggest that tod price may increase daily market revenue by over 10  using the adp approach  our experiments also show that tod price may be even more effective if sudden surges in demand take place in the market  
 to drive or to use the bus  an exploratory study of older people in malta older adults are becoming a larger portion of the world s population  and as a result  more attention is being given to their mobility and travel behaviour  such studies are however lacking in certain contexts like in malta  an island state in the mediterranean sea  malta is facing a concurrent high population density  high motorisation rate and an ageing population  nevertheless  older people s mobility is not adequately considered in transport policy  the aim of this paper is to have an exploratory understanding of mode choice in later life in malta  and understand the key determinants that affect older people s decision to drive or to use the bus  using descriptive statistics and two regression models  this paper shows how in malta older males drive significantly more than females  and the latter use more public transport  as age increases  the percentage of drivers declines for both genders  on the other hand  whilst for females public transport use also declined with age  the pattern of usage amongst males fluctuated  the data also showed that public transport was mostly used by non driving older people who could potentially be captive bus users  the determinants that predicted whether older people drove or not were  i  gender   ii  age   iii  their occupation status  and  iv  the presence of an assistive device  the significant predictors for older people s public transport use were  i  the number of cars available in the household   ii  age   iii  the district where they lived   iv  their occupation status   v  their participation in social activities and  vi  the presence of personal assistance  the two models revealed different predictors for mode choice however there were also several similarities  the paper concludes with a discussion  highlighting the importance and relevance of the results to transport policy makers  it also provides suggestions for further research to examine older people s mobility and travel behaviour  
 to stop or not to stop  contrasting compliant and non compliant driver behaviour at rural rail level crossings many rail level crossings  rlxs  have only passive protection  such as static signs instructing road users to stop  yield  or look for trains  stop signs have been suggested as a low cost option to improve safety at passive rlxs  as requiring drivers to stop should encourage safe behaviour  however  field observations have noted high rates of non compliance at stop controlled rlxs  to explore this further  we conducted an on road study to identify factors that influence compliance at stop controlled rlxs  twenty two drivers drove a 30 5 km route in rural australia  encompassing three stop controlled rlxs  in over half of all cases  59   drivers stopped completely at the rlx  on 27  of crossings drivers executed a rolling stop  and on 14  of crossings drivers violated the stop controls  rolling stops were defined as a continuous deceleration to   10 km h  but remaining above 0 km h  before accelerating to   10 km h  behavioural patterns  including visual checks and decision making  were similar when comparing drivers who made complete versus rolling stops  non compliant drivers did not differ from compliant drivers in approach speeds  but spent less time visually checking for trains  post drive interviews revealed some drivers wilfully disregarded the stop sign  whereas others did not notice the stop sign  those who intentionally violated noted trains were infrequent and suggested sight distance was good enough  even though all crossings had been formally assessed as having inadequate sight distance   overall the results suggest most drivers exhibit safe behaviour at passive rlxs  but a notable minority disregard or fail to notice signs  potential avenues for redesigning passive rlxs to improve safety are discussed  
 to survive and thrive under hypercompetition  an exploratory analysis of the influence of strategic purity on truckload motor carrier financial performance easy access to equipment and low barriers to entry have led to an intensely competitive truckload industry in which carriers possess little power to increase prices consistent with inflation  yet  the heterogeneous performance among tl carriers indicates that sustained success in such a hypercompetitive industry is possible  under the strategic purity framework  this research adopts a multimethod approach by first utilizing panel of financial and operational data composed of 828 firm quarter observations and finds that the relationship between a popular industry metric the trailer to tractor ratio   t2t  and performance is convex  empirical results are further explained by interviews with senior executives and industry analysts  this research contributes to theory and practice by first showing that  consistent with the strategic management literature  strategy driven heterogeneous configuration of common assets may increase performance  second  we show that strategic purity allows carriers supernormal financial performance  despite the hypercompetitive environment  third  as the tl industry becomes increasingly conscious of competitive strategies  our study shows that the t2t can be used as a guide for carriers to align their competitive strategy with asset configuration  
 to what extent do e bikes substitute travel by other modes  evidence from the netherlands after asian countries  the e bike is now also on the rise in many western countries  related to this development  an important question posed by scholars is to what extent the adoption of the e bike will lead to environmental and health benefits  these will be present if the e bike replaces travel by motorized modes  surveying the literature addressing this issue  empirical studies conducted to date do indeed reach the conclusion that the e bike is substituting travel by car  however  a general shortcoming of empirical studies is that substitution is assessed by asking direct questions to e bike owners  the aim of the present study is to address this limitation and statistically assess the effect of e bike ownership on various indicators of travel behavior  to this end  a conceptual model is developed  which is specified as a structural equation model and estimated using data from the last three national mobility surveys in the netherlands  2013  2014 and 2015   the results show that e bike ownership strongly reduces the use of the conventional bicycle  but also  to a lesser extent  car and public transport use  secondly  e bike owners reduce their car and public transport use more than conventional bicycle owners  and thirdly  on the level of vehicle ownership  the e bike acts as a substitute for the conventional bicycle and does not act as a substitute for the car  overall  the results shed some light on the health and environmental benefits of the uptake of e bikes in the netherlands   c  2017 elsevier ltd  all rights reserved

 toward best practice in human machine interface design for older drivers  a review of current design guidelines older adults are the fastest growing segment of the driving population  while there is a strong emphasis for older people to maintain their mobility  the safety of older drivers is a serious community concern  frailty and declines in a range of age related sensory  cognitive  and physical impairments can place older drivers at an increased risk of crash related injuries and death  a number of studies have indicated that in vehicle technologies such as advanced driver assistance systems  adas  and in vehicle information systems  ivis  may provide assistance to older drivers  however  these technologies will only benefit older drivers if their design is congruent with the complex needs and diverse abilities of this driving cohort  the design of adas and ivis is largely informed by automotive human machine interface  hmi  guidelines  however  it is unclear to what extent the declining sensory  cognitive and physical capabilities of older drivers are addressed in the current guidelines  this paper provides a review of key current design guidelines for ivis and adas with respect to the extent they address age related changes in functional capacities  the review revealed that most of the hmi guidelines do not address design issues related to older driver impairments  in fact  in many guidelines driver age and sensory cognitive and physical impairments are not mentioned at all and where reference is made  it is typically very broad  prescriptive advice on how to actually design a system so that it addresses the needs and limitations of older drivers is not provided  in order for older drivers to reap the full benefits that in vehicle technology can afford  it is critical that further work establish how older driver limitations and capabilities can be supported by the system design process  including their inclusion into hmi design guidelines   c  2016 elsevier ltd  all rights reserved  
 towards a pragmatic research agenda for the pss domain the tenuous link between knowledge and processes of urban strategy making leads to suboptimal plans  time delays and financial costs  the planning professional is ill equipped to deal with fundamental urban challenges that threaten the quality and competiveness of cities and regions  for decades  planning support systems  pss  are being developed to address this challenge  the pss research domain grew accordingly  only recently did researchers start to focus more directly on how pss are used  or not used  by planning practitioners  understanding the real life application of pss is fundamental for addressing the challenges of knowledge use  this commentary argues that we need to go beyond the current simplistic understanding of several key concepts  it identifies academic pathways that further mature the conceptualization of pss  of planning processes  of the participants and the relationship between them  the argument builds on ten years of full time research in this domain and combines this with recent insights from other academic fields  such as group performance and behavior psychology  this provides us pathways towards a more realistic evaluation of how knowledge can regain its important role in urban planning   c  2016 elsevier ltd  all rights reserved

 tracking a system of shared autonomous vehicles across the austin  texas network using agent based simulation this study provides a large scale micro simulation of transportation patterns in a metropolitan area when relying on a system of shared autonomous vehicles  savs   the six county region of austin  texas is used for its land development patterns  demographics  networks  and trip tables  the agent based matsim toolkit allows modelers to track individual travelers and individual vehicles  with great temporal and spatial detail  matsim s algorithms help improve individual travel plans  by changing tour and trip start times  destinations  modes  and routes   here  the sav mode requests were simulated through a stochastic process for four possible fare levels   0 50   0 75   1  and  1 25 per trip mile  these fares resulted in mode splits of 50 9  12 9  10 5  and 9 2  of the region s person trips  respectively  mode choice results show longer distance travelers preferring savs to private  human driven vehicles  hvs  thanks to the reduced burden of sav travel  since one does not have to drive the vehicle   for travelers whose households do not own an hv  savs  rather than transit  walking and biking  appear preferable for trips under 10 miles  which is the majority of those travelers  trip making  it may be difficult for traditional transit services and operators to survive once savs become available in regions like austin  where dedicated rail lines and bus lanes are few  simulation of sav fleet operations suggest that higher fare rates allow for greater vehicle replacement  ranging from 5 6 to 7 7 hvs per sav  assuming that the average sav serves 17 20 person trips per day   when fares rise  travel demands shift away from longer trip distances  empty vehicle miles traveled by the fleet of savs ranged from 7 8 to 14 2   across the scenarios in this study  implications of mobility and sustainability benefits of savs are also discussed in the paper  
 tradable network permits  a new scheme for the most efficient use of network capacity akamatsu et al   2006  proposed a new transportation demand management scheme called  tradable bottleneck permits   tbp   and proved its efficiency properties for a single bottleneck model  this paper explores the properties of a tbp system for general networks  an equilibrium model is first constructed to describe the states under the tbp system with a single od pair  it is proved that equilibrium resource allocation is efficient in the sense that the total transportation cost in a network is minimized  it is also shown that the  self financing principle  holds for the tbp system  furthermore  theoretical relationships between tbp and congestion pricing  cp  are discussed  it is demonstrated that tbp has definite advantages over cp when demand information is not perfect  whereas both tbp and cp are equivalent for the perfect information case  finally  it is shown that the efficiency result also holds for more general demand conditions   c  2017 elsevier ltd  all rights reserved  
 traffic dynamics of bicycle flow  experiment and modeling cycling has been advocated by many governments because it is a healthy and green transportation mode and it helps mitigate traffic congestion  however  compared with vast amounts of works on vehicle flow and pedestrian flow  the bicycle flow study currently lags behind  we have carried out experimental studies on bicycle flow on a 146 meters long circular road and on an on ramp system  we present the fundamental diagram of bicycle flow and the trajectories of each bicycle on the circular road  we have analyzed the spatiotemporal evolution of bicycle flow and found that jams spontaneously form above a critical density of approximately 0 37 bicycles m  for the on ramp system  no capacity drop has been observed  the similarity and difference between bicycle flow and vehicle flow has been discussed  we propose a cellular automaton model of bicycle flow  and the simulation results are in agreement with the experiments  
 traffic equilibrium and charging facility locations for electric vehicles this study investigates the electric vehicle  ev  traffic equilibrium and optimal deployment of charging locations subject to range limitation  the problem is similar to a network design problem with traffic equilibrium  which is characterized by a bi level model structure  the upper level objective is to optimally locate charging stations such that the total generalized cost of all users is minimized  where the user s generalized cost includes two parts  travel time and energy consumption  the total generalized cost is a measure of the total societal cost  the lower level model seeks traffic equilibrium  in which travelers minimize their individual generalized cost  all the utilized paths have identical generalized cost while satisfying the range limitation constraint  in particular  we use origin based flows to maintain the range limitation constraint at the path level without path enumeration  to obtain the global solution  the optimality condition of the lower level model is added to the upper level problem resulting in a single level model  the nonlinear travel time function is approximated by piecewise linear functions  enabling the problem to be formulated as a mixed integer linear program  we use a modest sized network to analyze the model and illustrate that it can determine the optimal charging station locations in a planning context while factoring the ev users  individual path choice behaviours  
 traffic noise  annoyance assessment of real and virtual sounds based on close proximity measurements the negative impact of noise on human health is well established and a high percentage of environmental noise is related with traffic sources  in this study  we compared annoyance judgments of real and virtual traffic sounds  virtual sounds were generated through an auralization software with input from close proximity tyre road noise measurements and real sounds were recorded through a head and torso simulator  both groups had sounds generated at two speeds and from three urban pavement surfaces  asphalt concrete  concrete blocks and granite cubes   under controlled laboratory conditions  participants rated the annoyance of each real and virtual stimulus  it was found that virtual stimuli  based on close proximity tyre road noise  can be used to assess traffic annoyance  in spite of systematic lower rates than those found for real stimuli  the effects of type of pavement and speed were the same for both conditions  real and virtualized stimulus   opposed to granite cubes  asphalt concrete had lower annoyance rates for both test speeds and higher rate differences between real and virtual stimuli  additionally  it was also found that annoyance is better described by loudness than by lamax  this evidence is stronger for the virtual stimuli condition than for the real stimuli one  nevertheless  we should stress that it is possible to accurately predict real annoyance rates from virtual auralized sound samples through a simple transformation model  the methodology developed is clearly efficient and significantly simplifies field procedures  allowing the reduction of experimental costs  a better control of variables and an increment on the accuracy of annoyance ratings   c  2017 elsevier ltd  all rights reserved  
 traffic state and emission estimation for urban expressways based on heterogeneous data urban expressways  as the backbone of a city s transportation network  are critical for reducing traffic congestion and improving transportation efficiency of the whole network  the estimation of traffic states and emissions for urban expressways supports traveler information provision and system wide traffic management  this paper aims to modify the extended generalized treiber helbing filter  egtf  to fuse gps data  probe vehicles  and traditional traffic data  loop detectors   so as to enhance more accurate estimations of traffic states and emissions on urban expressways  the speed field is first reconstructed based on heterogeneous data  and then travel time and emissions are estimated using a virtual trajectory method and the vt micro model  respectively  the algorithm is applied to a real world case study for an urban expressway in beijing  china  after the parameter tuning  the proposed algorithm is compared with existing algorithms from the literature  numerical results show that data fusion using the proposed algorithm could make better use of heterogeneous data and increase the accuracy of travel time and emissions estimations   c  2017 elsevier ltd  all rights reserved  
 traffic state estimation based on eulerian and lagrangian observations in a mesoscopic modeling framework the paper proposes a model based framework for estimating traffic states from eulerian  loop  and or lagrangian  probe  data  lagrangian space formulation of the lwr model adopted as the underlying traffic model provides suitable properties for receiving both eulerian and lagrangian external information  three independent methods are proposed to address eulerian data  lagrangian data and the combination of both  respectively  these methods are defined in a consistent framework so as to be implemented simultaneously  the proposed framework has been verified on the synthetic data derived from the same underlying traffic flow model  strength and weakness of both data sources are discussed  next  the proposed framework has been applied to a freeway corridor  the validity has been tested using the data from a microscopic simulator  and the performance is satisfactory even for low rate of probe vehicles around 5    c  2017 elsevier ltd  all rights reserved  
 train timetabling by skip stop planning in highly congested lines we study the problem of scheduling passenger trains in a highly congested railway double track line with the aim of increasing the number of scheduled trains  a feasible timetable of the trains currently scheduled in the network is given  additional trains should be scheduled to meet the increasing passenger demand  to achieve this goal  we are allowed to increase the dwelling time of some trains at some stations  to let them stop at some additional stations and even to skip a few stops  thereby  we need to take explicitly into account the deceleration and acceleration times that are needed by the train when it stops at a station  this problem integrates the choice of the train schedule with the choice of the train stops  the latter being usually made in the line planning process  to solve this problem  we propose a heuristic algorithm  extended from a previous method to include the new features of the studied application  and show its performance on real world instances of the chinese high speed jinghu corridor  between beijing and shanghai  involving up to 387 trains   c  2017 elsevier ltd  all rights reserved  
 train driving simulator studies  can novice drivers deliver the goods  early research suggests that  in a simulated train driving environment  unskilled  novice drivers may exhibit comparable behaviour and performance to experienced  professional train drivers after receiving only minimal  task specific training  however  this conclusion is based on exiguous performance indicators  such as speed limit exceedances  spad violations  etc  and considers only limited data  this paper presents further  detailed analysis of the driving performance data obtained from 20 drivers  13 novices and 7 experienced train drivers   who took part in a previous simulator based research study  utilising more sensitive and perspicuous measures  namely acceleration noise and control actuation  the results indicate that  although both cohorts exhibited similar performance using the original metrics  and would thus support the same conclusions  the manner in which this performance was effected is fundamentally different between groups  trained novice drivers  mainly comprising students and staff at the university of nottingham  adopted far more erratic speed control profiles  characterised by longer control actions and frequent switching between power and brake actuation  in contrast  experienced drivers delivered smoother acceleration braking profiles with more subtle  and shorter  control actions and less variance in speed  we conclude that although utilising trained non drivers may offer an appealing solution in the absence of professional train drivers during simulator based research  and their input remains of value  researchers should remain mindful when interpreting results and drawing conclusions from a contingent comprising non drivers  the work also demonstrates the value of dependent variables such as acceleration noise  and quantitative measures of control actuation  which may offer an insightful portfolio of measures in train driving research studies  
 transcultural validation and reliability of the spanish version of the behaviour of young novice drivers scale  bynds  in a colombian young driver population the overrepresentation of young drivers in road crashes  and the fatalities and injuries arising from those crashes  is an intractable problem around the world  a plethora of research has led to the development and application of a range of research tools  including self report survey instruments  one such instrument  the five factor behaviour of young novice driver scale  bynds   was developed in an australian young driver population  and has recently been validated in a new zealand young driver population  the current study aimed to validate the bynds in a colombian young driver population  the first application of the instrument in a developing country  translation from english to spanish  and back translation from spanish to english  in addition to culturally appropriate modifications  such as changing  right hand side  to  left hand side   resulted in a spanish version of the bynds  bynds sp   the bynds sp was administered to a sample of 392 young drivers aged 16 24 years  n   353 aged 19 24 years  with a valid driver s licence  an exploratory factor analysis revealed a six factor structure using 40 of the original 44 bynds sp items  accounting for 58 5  of the variance in self reported risky driving behaviour  ninety three percent of participants reported having ready access to their own vehicle  42  owned their own vehicle   with colombian young drivers most likely to report driving at night and on the weekend  the majority of participants reported driving in excess of posted speed limits  e g   only one third of participants reported never driving 10 20 km h over the speed limit   and driving in response to their mood  e g   only one third of participants reported they never drove faster if in a bad mood   as such  the bynds sp can reveal patterns of problematic behaviours  such as risky driving exposure   in addition to specific behaviours of concern  such as carrying passengers at night  and driving when tired   guiding the development and implementation of interventions targeting the risky driving behaviour of young drivers in colombia  in addition  the bynds sp can be used as a measure of intervention success if used as a baseline and as a follow up tool  further research can investigate the utility and applicability of the bynds sp in other spanish speaking countries  such as spain and mexico   c  2017 elsevier ltd  all rights reserved  
 transformation from intentions to habits in travel behavior  an awareness of a mediated form of intention travelers  behavioral intention and habits are well known constructs in the literature of travel behavior  in general  behavioral intention and habits explain the deliberate process and the habitual process of travelers  behavior  respectively  while behavioral intention is considered as a goal dependent deliberation  habits are not fully defined due to different views of researchers  the stimulus response approach describes habits as a goal independent automaticity  whereas the script based approach views habits as a goal dependent automaticity  the controversy in understanding the association between goals and habits necessitates a focus on the establishment of habits in which habits are assumed to appear due to a repetition of behavioral intention  with an aim to understand the process of transformation from intentions to habits  this study focuses on a mediated form of intention that is close to habits  it is hypothesized that the mediated form has characteristics similar to those of habits  empirical support for the hypothesis was obtained in public transportation domain  the findings of this study are important for the field because they present a possibility that past research has investigated the mediated form of intention instead of habits   c 2017 elsevier ltd  all rights reserved  
 transit oriented development in an urban rail transportation corridor transit oriented development  tod  has been recognized as an important avenue for creating a green transportation system  this paper addresses tod investment issue in terms of the location  number and size of the tod zones along a rail line  an urban system equilibrium problem with tod investment is first formulated  two social welfare maximization models  which take into account different investment regimes for tod projects  i e   public and private   are then proposed for optimizing tod investment schemes along a rail line and train service frequency on that line  in the public regime model  the government is responsible for the investment cost of tod projects  which is borne by the private property developers in the private regime model  the proposed models explicitly consider the interactions among the government  property developers and households in the urban system  together with the effects of the tod investment on households  residential location choices and housing market  the population thresholds for investing in a tod project under the public and private regimes are also identified  the findings show that the tod investment can cause population agglomeration at the tod zones and a compact city  households and the society can benefit from the tod investment  and the private tod investment regime outperforms the public regime in terms of total social welfare of urban system   c  2017 elsevier ltd  all rights reserved  
 transition to manual  comparing simulator with on road control transitions background  whilst previous research has explored how driver behaviour in simulators may transfer to the open road  there has been relatively little research showing the same transfer within the field of driving automation  as a consequence  most research into human automation interaction has primarily been carried out in a research laboratory or on closed circuit test tracks  objective  the aim of this study was to assess whether research into non critical control transactions in highly automated vehicles performed in driving simulators correlate with road driving conditions  method  twenty six drivers drove a highway scenario using an automated driving mode in the simulator and twelve drivers drove on a public motorway in a tesla model s with the autopilot activated  drivers were asked to relinquish  or resume control from the automation when prompted by the vehicle interface in both the simulator and on road condition  results  drivers were generally faster to resume control in the on road driving condition  however  strong positive correlations were found between the simulator and on road driving conditions for drivers transferring control to and from automation  no significant differences were found with regard to workload  perceived usefulness and satisfaction between the simulator and on road drives  conclusion  the results indicate high levels of relative validity of driving simulators as a research tool for automated driving research   c  2017 elsevier ltd  all rights reserved  
 transport fuel demand responses to fuel price and income projections  comparison of integrated assessment models income and fuel price pathways are key determinants in projections of the energy system in integrated assessment models  in recent years  more details have been added to the transport sector representation in these models  to better understand the model dynamics  this manuscript analyses transport fuel demand elasticities to projected income and fuel price levels  fuel price shocks were simulated under various scenario assumptions to isolate price effects on energy demand and create a transparent environment to compare fuel demand response  interestingly  the models show very comparable oil price elasticity values for the projected first 10 20 years that are also close to the range described in the empirical literature  when looking at the very long term  30 40 years   demand elasticity values widely vary between models  between 0 4 and  1 9  showing either continuous demand or increased demand responses over time  the latter can be the result of long response time to fuel price shocks  availability of new technologies  and feedback effects on fuel prices  the projected transport service demand is more responsive to changes in income than fuel price pathways  corresponding with the literature  calculating the models  inherent elasticities proved to be a suitable method to evaluate model behaviour and its application is also recommended for other models as well as other sectors represented in integrated assessment models   c  2017 elsevier ltd  all rights reserved  
 transport infrastructure costs in low carbon pathways the rate and manner in which transport infrastructure  e g  roads  railway tracks  airports  is deployed  will play an important role in determining energy demand  greenhouse gas emissions and the economic impact of the transport sector  this paper describes an exercise where the costs of infrastructure deployment for the transport sector have been incorporated into the imaclim r global e3 iam  in addition to adding these costs  the modelling of the criteria for the deployment of infrastructure for roads has also been improved  it is found that this model recalibration results in a more accurate baseline as compared to historically observed data  2001 2013  for investments in energy demand  road infrastructure  and passenger kilometers travelled  regarding macroeconomic effects  it is found that the imposition of a carbon emission trajectory to 2100 cause gdp to decrease relative to the newly calibrated baseline this is a standard iam result  however  when the deployment of infrastructure for roads and air travel is further constrained  the gdp loss is less than with a fixed carbon emission trajectory only  this is because early restriction of infrastructure for roads and air travel allows an expansion of public transport infrastructure which is adequate to meet low carbon transport service demand whereas when less public transport infrastructure is available  more costly mitigation investments must be made in other parts of the economy  this suggests that restricting infrastructure deployment as a complementary policy to carbon pricing  lowers the cost of mitigation   c  2016 elsevier ltd  all rights reserved  
 transport infrastructure  economic development and urbanization in india  1990 2011   is there any causal relationship  development of transport infrastructure has long been taken as a major tool in promoting economic development and urbanization of a region  however  it is quite debatable whether transport infrastructure promotes economic development and urbanization  or economic development and urbanization create demand first which leads to investment in transport infrastructure  each of the views has theoretical support  therefore  apart from theory  empirical evidence is required to establish direction of causality  which bears serious policy implications  this study looks into different sub sectors of transport infrastructure to find its long run relationship and direction of causality with economic development and urbanization  it first finds the order of integration of the variables and then tries to find their causal relationship using cointegration and granger causality test approach for india between 1990 and 2011  it uses vector auto regression and vector error correction model to find short run and long run causality  results showed existence of long run relationship between transport infrastructure and economic development  and the direction of causality is from economic development to transport infrastructure in most of the cases  thus drawing support in favor of wagner s law   c  2017 elsevier ltd  all rights reserved  
 transport investment and economic performance  a framework for project appraisal the case for major transport investment is frequently made in terms of impact on economic performance  a recurring difficulty however faced by policy makers is a disjoint between this motivation and the cost benefit analysis  which may be too narrow  broadening the set of economic mechanisms studied creates the risk that bad arguments are legitimised and effects can be exaggerated  there is a need for an appraisal framework that ensures all relevant impacts are captured  ensures the opportunity cost of drawing more resources into an activity is identified and meets the needs of the different audiences of the appraisal  there is a need for context specific appraisal  central to the impact on economic performance is how private sector investment responds to changes in accessibility  investment in one location can improve productivity  create growth  but may also displace output and employment  thus we group impacts within the framework into four types  user benefits  proximity and productivity effects  investment and land use impacts and employment effects  within each of these groups there are a series of transport economy mechanisms which become relevant in different contexts  some of these mechanisms are well established and are applied in practice  others still are more challenging and need to be the subject of further research  throughout improvements in the evidence base are needed  
 transport policies in hungary   historical background and current practice for national and regional level introduction this paper presents an overview of the current and past evolution of the hungarian transport policies and investigates how and what kind of results could be used in the future transport concepts and strategies  it also examines the practice of coordination between the different territorial and administrative levels of transport planning  it aims to identify the applied policy instruments and the monitoring processes installed  methods by using literature and legal background review from the past and current plans and policies the paper will also share the author s own empirical work experience while participating in the elaboration of the new national transport strategy  nks  as well as an insight from the transport policy for budapest  balazs mor plan   it gives an overview about the recent changes in the transport policy of hungary and its implication for the project priority lists  results the expected results are the clear identification of synergies and gaps among the ongoing policies together with the divulgation of good and bad practices for the wider professional audience  conclusions the need for a sustainable transport system  which assumes a sustainable economy as well is a huge challenge for policy makers  in order to avoid parallel policy making  especially when making policies for different areas  and minimize the economic and social cost of transport  we need a coordinated  multimodal approach  which includes the necessary organizations and public private bodies  with secure and sustainable financial background  with exact tasks and responsibility on all territorial levels  
 transport policy planning in germany   an analysis of political programs and investment masterplans introduction in germany  the most recent comprehensive transport policy program of the federal government was published in the year 2000  followed by several sector specific programs  aims  strategies  and priorities specified in the different governmental transport policy documents are discussed in the paper  with a particular focus on the modal split between road and rail  apart from the fiscal and the regulatory framework  the most important policy area for the federal government is the provision of transport infrastructure  in 2016  the federal government enacted a new investment masterplan  therefore  the experience with the former plan is described and key elements of the new masterplan are presented  the overall investment into transport infrastructure as well as the share of the different modes of transport are analyzed in more detail  methods germany s transport policy is analyzed based on the aims  strategies  and priorities which are expressed in the published programs  text analysis   data on modal split and user costs is used to assess transport policy developments  the infrastructure masterplans are analyzed based on the planned allocation of investment for different modes of transport and types of investment  moreover  for the past masterplan actual budget data is used for the analysis  results with respect to transport policy programs  a shift in the priorities can be observed  closely linked to the changing political majorities  whereas the comprehensive program published in 2000 stresses the importance of a sustainable development and calls for a modal shift  more recent programs focus on the competitive situation of german transport service providers  moreover  more emphasis is put on the implementation of specific measures  with respect to infrastructure provision  in particular investment into road infrastructure was below the planned values  the recently enacted plan allocates more funds to the maintenance and replacement of infrastructure  and to inland waterways  conclusions although the priorities set by the government in published transport policy programs have changed  the effects on the overall traffic development remain rather limited  with respect to the federal transport infrastructure masterplan  an overestimation of the number of projects which might be completed within the given timeframe has been criticized several times  although the political progress is providing some incentives to include a high number of projects in the masterplan  a more realistic approach appears to be suitable  also signaling the need for a larger budget  in the past  budget increases have been the result of macroeconomic considerations rather than of transport policy requirements  it remains to be seen whether these deficits will be at least partially eliminated during the lifespan of the recently enacted masterplan  
 transport poverty and fuel poverty in the uk  from analogy to comparison the notion of  fuel poverty   referring to affordable warmth  underpins established research and policy agendas in the uk and has been extremely influential worldwide  in this context  british researchers  official policymaking bodies and ngos have put forward the notion of  transport poverty   building on an implicit analogy between  recognised  fuel poverty and  neglected  transport affordability issues  however  the conceptual similarities and differences between  fuel  and  transport  poverty remain largely unaddressed in the uk  this paper systematically compares and contrasts the two concepts  examining critically the assumption of a simple equivalence between them  we illustrate similarities and differences under four headings   i  negative consequences of lack of warmth and lack of access   ii  drivers of fuel and transport poverty   iii  definition and measurement   iv  policy interventions  our review suggests that there are important conceptual and practical differences between transport and domestic energy consumption  with crucial consequences for how affordability problems amongst households are to be conceptualised and addressed  in a context where transport and energy exhibit two parallel policy worlds  the analysis in the paper and these conclusions reinforce how and why these differences matter  as we embark on an ever closer union between our domestic energy and transport energy systems the importance of these contradictions will become increasingly evident and problematic  this work contributes to the long term debate about how best to manage these issues in a radical energy transition that properly pays attention to issues of equity and affordability  
 transportation behaviours of the growing canadian single person households single person households have been on the rise in canada and especially in large canadian cities  this demographic trend has many impacts on society  as in many regards solos behave differently than other strata s of the population  the objective of this paper is to explore the transport related implications of the growth in single person households in canadian cities  the 2010 canadian general social survey  n 15 390  provides individual level socio demographic characteristics and time use diary that are used to classify individual s living situation  living alone  roommates  single parents  couples  and families  and to asses six transportation behaviours  owning a driver s license  access to a vehicle  commute distance  travel time by mode  overall trip frequency and trip frequency by purposes   logistic  ordered logistic and negative binomial regressions are used to uncover the relationships between household types and travel behaviours  and to determine the transport related implications of single person households beyond other socio demographic characteristics in canadian cities  our findings confirm associations between single person households and transportation behaviours and suggest they adopt a more environmentally sustainable lifestyle  at least with respect to travel  on average  single person households commute shorter distances and are less likely to own a driver s license or have access to a vehicle than respondents from family households  the share of solos using a car is 17 percentage points lower than respondents living in family households and rates of use of active modes are 9 percentage points higher than respondents in couple households  despite solos  overall trip frequency not significantly differing from family households  solos do partake in more food and social related trips  age group difference exists within the solos category  the growth of single person households may have considerable implications on urban transportation demand  if solos do chose to locate in places where alternative transportation modes are not accessible  the growth of this group may result in an increase in overall motorization rates because they are less likely to share a car  
 transportation time and reliability in intermodal transport chains in recent years the role of sustainable and alternative transportation concepts has significantly grown in importance due to increasing freight transport volumes  congested roads and intensifying environmental problems  various industries understand inter modal transportation as a solution and feasible alternative to unimodal road transportation  as it combines the strengths of different transportation modes  long haul transportation that usually is carried out by rail or waterborne transportation represents a key feature of intermodal transport chains distinguishing them from unimodal transport chains  however  so far there has been no systematic analysis of the effect of long haul transportation on the performance of an intermodal transport chain in terms of transportation time and transport time reliability  the aim of this paper is therefore to analyze and evaluate the effect of long haul transportation on performance by proposing an analytical and a simulation model  the analysis contributes to a better understanding of impacts resulting from different modal shares as well as influencing variables and enables to derive recommendations for future transport planning  
 travel and residual emotional well being this study addresses the question of how work commutes change positive versus negative and active versus passive mood experienced after the commutes  analyses are presented for 230 time sampled morning commutes to work  made by 146 randomly sampled people in three different swedish cities  asking them to use smartphones to report mood before  directly after  and later in the work place after the commute  the results show that self reported positive emotional responses evoked by critical incidents are related to mood changes directly after the commute but not later in the day  it is also shown that satisfaction with the commute  measured retrospectively  is related to travel mode  travel time  as well as both positive and negative emotional responses to critical incidents   c  2017 elsevier ltd  all rights reserved  
 travel time budgets  new evidence from multi year  multi day data the existence of stable personal travel time expenditure has been debated for more than 40 years  aggregate research has supported this notion  while disaggregate research has largely failed to find evidence  in this paper  a unique data set containing multi day gps measurements of travel time expenditures over a period from 5 to 8 years is used to examine the evidence for stable daily personal travel time expenditures  the evidence from this study adds further support to the notion that people expend a stable amount of travel time over a period as long as 8 years  and the average level of such expenditure accords almost exactly with that claimed over the years from aggregate studies  
 travel time models with and without homogeneity over time in dynamic network loading and dynamic traffic assignment for networks  the link travel time is often taken as a function of the number of vehicles x t  on the link at time t of entry to the link  that is  tau t    f x t    which implies that the performance of the link is invariant  homogeneous  over time  here we let this relationship vary over time  letting the travel time depend directly on the time of day  thus tau t    f x t  t   various authors have investigated the properties of the previous  homogeneous  model  including conditions sufficient to ensure that it satisfies first in first out  fifo   here we extend these results to the inhomogeneous model  and find that the new sufficient conditions have a natural interpretation  we find that the results derived by several previous authors continue to hold if we introduce one additional condition  namely that the rate of change of f x t   t  with respect to the second parameter has a certain  negative  lower bound  as a prelude  we discuss the equivalence of equations for flow propagation equations and for intertemporal conservation of flows  and argue that neither these equations nor the travel time model are physically meaningful if fifo is not satisfied  in section 7 we provide some examples of time dependent travel times and some numerical illustrations of when these will or will not adhere to fifo  
 trends in reports of driving following illicit drug consumption among regular drug users in australia  2007 2013  has random roadside drug testing had a deterrent effect  introduction  driving following illicit drug consumption   drug driving   is a potential road safety risk  roadside drug testing  rdt  is conducted across australia with the dual aims of prosecuting drivers with drugs in their system and deterring drug driving  we examined trends over time in self reported past six month drug driving among sentinel samples of regular drug users and assessed the impact of experiences of rdt on drug driving among these participants  methods  data from 1913 people who inject drugs  pwid  and 3140 regular psychostimulant users  rpu  who were first time participants in a series of repeat cross sectional sentinel studies conducted in australian capital cities from 2007 to 2013 and reported driving in the past six months were analysed  trends over time were assessed using the x 2  test for trend  multivariable logistic regressions assessed the relationship between experiences of rdt and recent drug driving  adjusting for survey year  jurisdiction of residence and sociodemographic and drug use characteristics  results  the percentage of participants reporting recent  past six months  drug driving decreased significantly over time among both samples  pwid  83   2007  vs  74   2013   p   0 001  rpu  72  vs  56   p   0 001   but drug driving remained prevalent  lifetime experience of rdt increased significantly over time  pwid  6   2007  vs  32   2013   p   0 001  rpu  2  vs  11   p   0 001   there were no significant associations between experiencing rdt and drug driving among either pwid or rpu  conclusion  although there is some evidence that drug driving among  key risk groups of regular drug users is declining in australia  possibly reflecting a general deterrent effect of rdt  experiencing rdt appears to have no specific deterrent effect on drug driving  further intervention  with a particular focus on changing attitudes towards drug driving  may be needed to further reduce this practice among these groups  
 trends in teen driver licensure  driving patterns and crash involvement in the united states  2006 2015 introduction  the monitoring the future  mtf  survey provides nationally representative annual estimates of licensure and driving patterns among u s  teens  a previous study using mtf data reported substantial dedines in the proportion of high school seniors that were licensed to drive and increases in the proportion of nondrivers following the recent u s  economic recession  method  to explore whether licensure and driving patterns among u s  high school seniors have rebounded in the post recession years  we analyzed mtf licensure and driving data for the decade of 2006 2015  we also examined trends in teen driver involvement in fatal and nonfatal injury crashes for that decade using data from the fatality analysis reporting system and national automotive sampling system general estimates system  respectively  results  during 2006 2015  the proportion of high school seniors that reported having a driver s license declined by 9 percentage points  11   from 81  to 72  and the proportion that did not drive during an average week increased by 8 percentage points  44   from 18  to 26   the annual proportion of black seniors that did not drive was consistently greater than twice the proportion of nondriving white seniors  overall during the decade  17  and 18 year old drivers experienced large declines in fatal and nonfatal injury crashes  although crashes increased in both 2014 and 2015  conclusions  the mtf data indicate that licensure and driving patterns among u s  high school seniors have not rebounded since the economic recession  the recession had marked negative effects on teen employment opportunities  which likely influenced teen driving patterns  possible explanations for the apparent discrepancies between the mtf data and the 2014 and 2015 increases in crashes are explored  practical applications  mtf will continue to be an important resource for clarifying teen driving trends in relation to crash trends and informing strategies to improve teen driver safety  published by elsevier ltd  
 trip and parking generation at transit oriented developments  a case study of redmond tod  seattle region the decision on how best to allocate land around transit stations is a debated topic  with transit officials often opting for park and ride lots over active uses such as multifamily housing  office  and retail organized into transit oriented developments  tods   in this study  we identify the ten best self contained tods in ten regions across united states based on seven criteria  dense  mixed use  pedestrian friendly  adjacent to transit  built after transit  fully developed  and with self contained parking  we measure trip and parking generation at one of these tods  the redmond tod in the seattle region  as a pilot study  using an onsite count and intercept survey  the results show that the redmond tod has 1 7 times more trips made by walking and 3 times more trips made by transit than seattle s regional average  the actual vehicle trips we observed are only 37   of the institute of transportation engineers   ite  expected value  the actual residential peak period parking demand is only 65   of the ite s peak demand  and the actual commercial peak period parking demand is only 27   of the ite s peak demand  additionally  the peak period of transit parking was daytime  while the peak periods of commercial and residential were evening and nighttime  there is a real opportunity for sharing parking spaces among these different uses  something which is not realized at present  
 truck freight demand elasticity with respect to tolls in new york state road pricing is an important travel demand management strategy and its effects on transportation system has been widely investigated  toll elasticity has been derived in the existing literature to characterize its effect on travel demand all around the world  however  very few studies have comprehensively analyzed the effect of tolls on freight transportation  which plays an increasingly important role in social and economic activities  to enrich the understanding of freight travel demand  this study conducted a stated preference survey on freight carriers who routinely use toll facilities  a regression model about freight carriers  stated reduction in vehicle miles traveled  vmt  on toll roads is then developed  the elasticity value is derived and compared with values in existing literature  based on the calibrated model  the vmt change in response to hypothetical toll price increases is simulated for new york state  the simulation results reveal important insights that will help policy makers design ideal freight demand management strategies   c  2017 elsevier ltd  all rights reserved  
 truck scheduling in the postal service industry the distribution networks of the postal service industry are organized according to the hub and spoke paradigm  so that parcel distribution centers play a crucial role to consolidate the parcel flows to full truckloads  in these terminals  inbound trucks are unloaded at gates  shipments are identified  sorted by the central sortation conveyor system  and loaded into outbound trailers  in which they are moved toward their next destination  in this context  the scheduling of inbound trucks  which assigns a gate and a processing interval to each truck  is an essential operational decision problem  we formalize the resulting optimization problem and provide suited solution procedures  furthermore  we test the impact of truck scheduling on the sortation performance of the central conveyor system with the help of a comprehensive terminal simulation  
 truck involved crashes injury severity analysis for different lighting conditions on rural and urban roadways this paper investigates factors affecting injury severity of crashes involving trucks for different lighting conditions on rural and urban roadways  it uses 2009 2013 ohio crash data from the highway safety information system  the explanatory factors include the occupant  vehicle  collision  roadway  temporal and environmental characteristics  six separate mixed logit models were developed considering three lighting conditions  daylight  dark  and dark lighted  on two area types  rural and urban   a series of log likelihood ratio tests were conducted to validate that these six separate models by lighting conditions and area types are warranted  the model results suggest major differences in both the combination and the magnitude of impact of variables included in each model  some variables were significant only in one lighting condition but not in other conditions  similarly  some variables were found to be significant in one area type but not in other area type  these differences show that the different lighting conditions and area types do in fact have different contributing effects on injury severity in truck involved crashes  further highlighting the importance of examining crashes based on lighting conditions on rural and urban roadways  age and gender of occupant  who is the most severely injured in a crash   truck types  aadt  speed  and weather condition were found to be factors that have significantly different levels of impact on injury severity in truck involved crashes  
 truthful  budget balanced bundle double auctions for carrier collaboration this paper aims to propose effective auction mechanisms for the carrier collaboration problem with bilateral exchange  which is generally the problem of how to realize the potential of carrier collaboration over a bilateral exchange transportation network  e g   a b2b e commerce logistics environment   carriers offer the lanes with the highest marginal costs for subcontracting  while they are allowed to bid on bundles of the lanes  we construct a bundle double auction  bda  for the one unit demand case in which the lane offered by each buyer  transportation service purchaser  is only required to be covered with one truckload once  the bda mechanism realizes incentive compatibility  individual rationality  budget balance  and asymptotical efficiency  we then propose two mechanisms  called bda 1 and bda 2  for the multiunit demand case in which each buyer asks for one or multiple truckloads of transportation service  both mechanisms are effective but differ in incentive compatibility and realized social welfare  the computational study shows that all proposed mechanisms are practically implementable and lead to considerable cost savings for the carrier collaboration network  and most of the benefits generated via collaboration are assigned among carriers  we also numerically analyze the impacts of three operational factors  network structure  the degree of self served lanes  and the number of lanes in the network  
 turning movements  vehicle offsets and ageing drivers driving behaviour at channelized and unchannelized intersections ageing drivers experience a higher risk of intersection crashes because of their decrease in driving efficiency  including the decline in cognitive ability  head and neck flexibility  and visual acuity  although several studies have been conducted to examine the factors associated with ageing driver crashes at intersections  little research has been conducted to examine the differences in the factors related to ageing drivers  turning paths and intersection geometric features  this study aims to improve the safety of ageing drivers at intersections by identifying the maneuvers that are risky for them and tracking their turning movements at selected intersections  we find that ageing drivers experience more crashes at intersections than younger drivers  especially crashes involving turning movements  furthermore  ageing drivers experience more crashes at unchannelized intersections compared to channelized intersections  in addition  this study finds that ageing drivers exhibit greater and more inconsistent offsets during turning movements compared to those of younger drivers at both channelized and unchannelized intersections  ageing drivers also tend to make relatively sharper or tighter turns than younger drivers  hence  transportation engineers and road safety professionals should consider appropriate countermeasures to reduce the risks of crashes involving ageing drivers at intersections  
 two phase decomposition method for the last train departure time choice in subway networks an urban subway network with a number of service lines forms the backbone of the public transport system for a large city of high population  such as singapore  hong kong and beijing  passengers in these large cities heavily rely on urban subway networks for their daily life  the departure times of the last trains running on different lines of an urban subway network should be well coordinated in order to serve more passengers who can successfully transfer from one line to another  which is referred to as the last train departure time choice problem  this study aims to develop a global optimization method that can solve the last train departure time choice problem for large scale urban subway networks  to do so  it first formulates a mixed integer linear programming  milp  model by introducing auxiliary binary and integer decision variables  for the real life and large scale instances  however  the formulated milp model cannot be solved directly by the global optimization methods such as branch and bound algorithm invoked by cplex one of the powerful optimization solvers because of the instance sizes  an effective two phase decomposition method is thus proposed to globally solve the large scale problems by decomposing the original milp into two milp models with small sizes  finally  a real case study from the beijing subway network is conducted to assess the efficiency and applicability of the two phase decomposition method and perform the necessary sensitivity analysis of the operational parameters involved in the last train departure time choice problem   c  2017 elsevier ltd  all rights reserved  
 unbundling political and economic rationality  a non parametric approach tested on transport infrastructure in spain this paper suggests a simple quantitative method to assess the extent to which public investment decisions are dominated by political or economic motivations  the true motivation can be identified by modeling each policy goal as the focus of the optimization anchoring a data envelopment analysis of the efficiency of the observed implementation  in other words  we rank performance based on how far observed behavior is from the optimal behavior under each possible goal  and the goal for which the distance is smaller reveals the specific motivation of investment or any policy decision for that matter  the approach is tested on spain s land transport infrastructure policy since it is argued by many observers to be driven more by political than economic concerns  resulting in a mismatch between capacity investment and traffic demand  the method clearly shows that investments have generally been more consistent with a political objective  the centralization of economic power  than with an economic objective  maximizing mobility   
 uncovering the spatiotemporal patterns of co2 emissions by taxis based on individuals  daily travel traffic related carbon dioxide  co2  emissions have become a major problem in cities  especially  the co2 emissions induced by taxis account for a high proportion in total co2 emissions  the availability of taxi trajectory data presents new opportunities for addressing co2 emissions induced by taxis  few previous studies have analyzed the impact of human trips on co2 emissions  this paper investigates trip related co2 emission patterns based on individuals  travel behavior using taxi trajectory data  first  we propose a trip purpose inference method that takes into account the spatiotemporal attractiveness of pois to divide human trips into different types  further  we reveal the spatiotemporal patterns of co2 emissions from various types of trips  including temporal regularity and periodicity as well as spatial distribution of  black areas   finally  comparative analysis of co2 emissions for different kinds of trips based on trip behavior is conducted using three variables  namely trip distance  trip duration and trip speed  this study is helpful for us to understand how to make travel and cities more sustainable through modifying people s trip behaviors or taxi trips  
 understanding future mode choice intentions of transit riders as a function of past experiences with travel quality this paper empirically investigates the causes for transit use cessation  focusing on the influence of users  personal experiences  resulting levels of satisfaction  and subsequent behavioral intentions  it builds on a novel data set in which observed  objective measures of travel times are mapped to smartphone based surveys where participants assess their travel experience  an integrated choice and latent variable model is developed to explain the influence of satisfaction with operations  travel times  and satisfaction with the travel environment  e g   crowding  on behavioral intentions  satisfaction is modeled as a latent variable  and the choice consists of participants  stated desire and intention to continue using public transportation  the results show how delays  in particular in vehicle delays but also transfer times and being left behind at stops  contribute to passengers  intentions to cease transit use  furthermore  a number of critical incidents  i e   particularly memorable negative experiences  are found to have negative and significant effects on overall satisfaction and on willingness to continue using public transportation  the usefulness of the framework is demonstrated in a set of simulations in which the effect of three types of delays on passengers  willingness to remain transit riders is modeled  this work highlights the value and potential of using new data collection methods to gain insights on complex behavioral processes  and it is intended to form the basis for new modeling tools to understand the causes of transit use cessation and the impact of various strategies and service quality improvements to reduce rider ship turnover  
 understanding job housing relationship and commuting pattern in chinese cities  past  present and future there are debates about whether job housing balance and short commuting distances could be achieved through government intervention in western countries  however  few studies have been carried out in developing context  the present study aims to fill in this knowledge vacuum by studying how china s changing socio spatial context  particularly the spatial ideas of danwei  influences job housing relationships and commuting patterns from a historical perspective  the results clearly show that the dominant trend in commuting patterns in chinese cities has changed from intra danwei commuting before 1978 to reverse commuting from the city center to the inner suburbs in 1978 1998  to long distance suburb to city commuting since 1998  the findings suggest that government intervention could be helpful in achieving shorter commute in china  and that urban planning and policy that promote mixed land use and job housing balance should be considered  some limitations of government intervention are also discussed   c  2016 elsevier ltd  all rights reserved

 understanding the effects of transit benefits on employees  travel behavior  evidence from the new york new jersey region implementing effective travel demand management measures provides an opportunity to reduce transport dependence on the private car  there is growing acknowledgement that the strategy of implementing transit benefits may boost transit ridership and reduce personal vehicle use  this research contributes to the understanding of this issue by examining the relationship between commuter benefits and mode choice for commuting trips in the states of new york and new jersey  us   based on individual data from the regional household travel survey conducted by the new york metropolitan transportation council and north jersey transportation planning authority  we adopted a multinomial logit model to identify the extent to which transport benefits to employees   including public transport related  private transport related and benefits for walking and cycling   promote changes in commuters  modal split  the analysis shows that commuter benefits play a significant role in explaining observed travel patterns  benefit programs that pay for auto expenses  e g  toll payments  mileage reimbursement  free parking  are negatively correlated with transit  biking  and walking  while employer funded benefit programs for transit passes and bike reimbursements increase their respective mode shares  this result confirms that promoting these types of measures is an effective policy to encourage the use of public transport modes  thus increasing efficiency and sustainability in daily mobility patterns   c  2017 elsevier ltd  all rights reserved  
 understanding the mechanism of traffic hysteresis and traffic oscillations through the change in task difficulty level this paper provides a detailed understanding of the mechanism of traffic hysteresis and traffic oscillations from the driver behavior perspective  microscopic evaluation of trajectories inside seven selected oscillations is performed to obtain a comprehensive picture of these puzzling phenomena  a new method based on driver s task difficulty  td  profile is proposed to capture changes in driver behavior in response to the disturbance caused by traffic oscillations  a close connection between the td profile and evolution  such as formation and growth  of the stop and go traffic oscillations is found  furthermore  driver behaviors inside the oscillations are identified based on driver s td profile  and their connection with hysteresis magnitudes is established  finally  a generalized linear model suggests that variables related to traffic flow and driver characteristics are significant predictors of hysteresis magnitude  one noteworthy finding is that  the bigger the difference between the average td levels between deceleration and acceleration phases of a vehicle trajectory  the larger the hysteresis magnitude becomes   c  2017 elsevier ltd  all rights reserved

 unexpected versus expected network disruption  effects on travel behavior this paper discusses the observed evolution of traffic in the minneapolis st paul  twin cities  region road network following the unexpected collapse of the i 35w bridge over the mississippi river  the observations presented within this paper reveal that traffic dynamics are potentially different when a prolonged and unexpected network disruption occurs rather than a preplanned closure  following the disruption from the i 35w bridge s unexpected collapse  we witnessed a unique trend  an avoidance phenomenon after the disruption  more specifically  drivers are observed to drastically avoid areas near the disruption site  but gradually return after a period of time following the collapse  this trend is not observed in preplanned closures studied to date  to model avoidance  it is proposed that the tragedy generated a perceived travel cost that discouraged commuters from using these sections  these perceived costs are estimated for the twin cities network and found to be best described as an exponential decay cost curve with respect to time  after reinstituting this calibrated cost curve into a mesoscopic simulator  the simulated traffic into the discouraged areas are found to be within acceptable limits of the observed traffic on a week by week basis  the proposed model is applicable to both practitioners and researchers in many traffic related fields by providing an understanding of how traffic dynamics will evolve after a long term  unexpected network disruption  
 urban freight policymaking  the role of qualitative and quantitative research the paper s fundamental tenet is that sound policymaking requires a solid understanding of how the target s  of a policy would react to it  transportation systems  particularly urban freight  are complex  heterogeneous  and often poorly understood by policymakers  enacting policies that impact such a complex system can lead to ineffective efforts  and often  negative unintended effects  the best way to avoid these outcomes is to ensure that urban freight policy is supported by behavior research  to understand what kind of research most effectively supports sound policymaking  the authors conduct an ex post assessment of qualitative and quantitative research techniques to determine which one more effectively predicts the behavioral changes that were seen by transportation users in response to transportation policies  the authors identify the key findings of five large research projects that  using qualitative and quantitative research  investigated the stated and revealed behavioral reactions of transportation users to pricing and incentive policies in the new york city metropolitan area  the findings are catalogued and used to compare insights gained from the qualitative research  and from the quantitative research conducted afterwards  the analyses shed light on the potential and the limitations of both approaches  the synergies that exist between them  and their potential in assisting the development of effective urban freight policies  
 urban intermodal terminals  the entropy maximising facility location problem an important problem confronting port cities is where and how to accommodate port growth  larger ships combined with increased container throughput require more yard space and generate more traffic  straining the urban fabric in the vicinity of the port  a promising solution to this problem is the development of urban intermodal container terminals  imts  that interface with both road and rail  or possibly inland waterway  networks  this raises two linked choices  where to locate the intermodal terminals and what will be their likely usage by multiple shippers  each having a choice of whether or not to use the imt as part of an intermodal transport chain  the use of an imt by a shipper indicates the shipper s choice of intermodal transport  which comprises a combined use of a high capacity mode  rail or barge between the port and the imt  and trucks  between the imt and the cargo origin or destination   the overall problem therefore comprises a mode choice problem embedded within a facility location problem  this paper employs the method of entropy maximisation to combine a logit mode choice model with a facility location model  leading to a non linear mixed integer programming model  the principal features of the entropy maximising facility location model are illustrated by small and large numerical examples   c  2017 elsevier ltd  all rights reserved  
 urban land use  sorting  and population density  a continuous logit model this paper analyzes land use  sorting  and population density in a polycentric city  to this end  the paper develops a continuous spatial choice logit model of a closed polycentric city with multiple income classes and endogenous land use where households select their workplace and residence locations probabilistically  in contrast to the classic urban model with deterministic location choices  the continuous logit model predicts incomplete segregation of citizens who work in different business centers  and  therefore  cross commuting  the relative size of income elasticity of both land demand and commuting costs determines income sorting of individuals working in a particular business district  due to heterogeneous preferences for residence locations and workplaces  this may not hold for the aggregate spatial pattern of multiple income classes  finally  individual land use may decrease as distance between workplace and residence increases   c  2017 elsevier ltd  all rights reserved  
 urban rail transit ppps  lessons from east asian cities private sector participation in urban rail transit has proliferated in the past two decades  the large metropolises of east asia have had decades of experience with private sector participation in the provision of heavy metro services  the design of these public private partnerships  ppp  are varied  the diverse experiences of tokyo  hong kong  singapore and beijing contain valuable lessons for other cities  using a case study approach  this paper discusses three features of urban rail transit developments in the context of east asian cities  viz   farebox recovery  land value capture mechanisms  and vertical structure of the industry  super vertical integration between rail transit and real estate development as land value capture strategy to finance urban rail transit has proven to be successful in japanese cities and hong kong  singapore s experience illustrates that vertically unbundled ppps could cut off avenues for cross subsidisation  reduce information flows as well as economies of scale and scope  introduce principal agent problems  and result in underinvestment in capital stock and maintenance  we conclude that  i  a combination of high farebox recovery ratios and successful land value capture contributed significantly to the development of urban rail transit in east asia cities   ii  given the complexities and high costs of heavy metros  the optimal structure is a vertically integrated public owned and driven system  with the public sector entering into selective partnerships with the private sector where risk sharing is clearly defined and allocated  
 urban street structure and traffic safety introduction  this paper reports the influence of road type and junction density on road traffic fatality rates in u s  cities  method  the fatality analysis reporting system  fars  files were used to obtain fatality rates for all cities for the years 2005 2010  a stratified random sample of 16 u s  cities was taken  and cities with high and low road traffic fatality rates were compared on their road layout details  tiger maps were used   statistical analysis was done to determine the effect of junction density and road type on road traffic fatality rates  results  the analysis of road network and road traffic crash fatality rates in these randomly selected u s  cities shows that   a  higher number of junctions per road length was significantly associated with a lower motor vehicle crash and pedestrian mortality rates  and   b  increased number of kilometers of roads of any kind was associated with higher fatality rates  but an additional kilometer of main arterial road was associated with a significantly higher increase in total fatalities  when compared to non arterial roads  the higher the ratio of highways and main arterial roads  there was an association with higher fatality rates  conclusions  these results have important implications for road safety professionals  they suggest that once the road and street structure is put in place  that will influence whether a city has low or high traffic fatality rates  a city with higher proportion of wider roads and large city blocks will tend to have higher traffic fatality rates  and therefore in turn require much more efforts in police enforcement and other road safety measures  practical applications  urban planners need to know that smaller block size with relatively less wide roads will result in lower traffic fatality rates and this needs to be incorporated at the planning stage   c  2017 national safety council and elsevier ltd  all rights reserved

 using fixed parameter and random parameter ordered regression models to identify significant factors that affect the severity of drivers  injuries in vehicle train collisions this study attempts to identify significant factors that affect the severity of drivers  injuries when colliding with trains at railroad grade crossings by analyzing the individual specific heterogeneity related to those factors over a period of 15 years  both fixed parameter and random parameter ordered regression models were used to analyze records of all vehicle train collisions that occurred in the united states from january 1  2001 to december 31  2015  for fixed parameter ordered models  both probit and negative log log link functions were used  the latter function accounts for the fact that lower injury severity levels are more probable than higher ones  separate models were developed for heavy and light duty vehicles  higher train and vehicle speeds  female  and young drivers  below the age of 21 years  were found to be consistently associated with higher severity of drivers  injuries for both heavy and light duty vehicles  furthermore  favorable weather  light duty trucks  including pickup trucks  panel trucks  mini vans  vans  and sports utility vehicles   and senior drivers  above the age of 65 years  were found be consistently associated with higher severity of drivers  injuries for light duty vehicles only  all other factors  e g  air temperature  the type of warning devices  darkness conditions  and highway pavement type  were found to be temporally unstable  which may explain the conflicting findings of previous studies related to those factors  
 using interactive virtual presence to support accurate installation of child restraints  efficacy and parental perceptions introduction  child restraint systems  car seats  reduce injury risk for young children involved in motor vehicle crashes  but parents experience significant difficulty installing child restraints correctly  installation by certified child passenger safety  cps  technicians yields more accurate installation  but is impractical for broad distribution  a potential solution is use of interactive virtual presence via smartphone application  app   which permits  hands on  teaching through simultaneous and remote joint exposure to 3 dimensional images  method  in two studies  we examined the efficacy of remote communication via interactive virtual presence to help parents install child restraints  study 1 was conducted at existing car seat checkpoints and study 2 at preschools daycare centers  in both cases  existing installations were assessed by certified cps technicians using an objective coding scheme  participants then communicated with remotely located certified cps technicians via a smartphone app offering interactive virtual presence  technicians instructed participants to install child restraints and then the installation was inspected by on site technicians  both before and after the remote interaction  participants completed questionnaires concerning perception of child restraints and child restraint installation  self efficacy to install child restraints  and perceived risk of injury to children if they were in a crash  results  in both studies  accuracy of child restraint installations improved following the remote interaction between participants and certified cps technicians  together  the two samples achieved a weighted average of 90  correct installations across a multi point inspection  both samples reported increased self efficacy to install child restraints and altered perceptions about the accuracy of the child restraint installations in their vehicles  conclusions  findings support use of interactive virtual presence as a strategy to realize accurate installation of child restraints  practical applications  interactive virtual presence between certified cps technicians and the public via smartphone app has potential to improve proper child restraint installations broadly  including to vulnerable and underserved rural populations   c  2017 national safety council and elsevier ltd  all rights reserved  
 using metro smart card data to model location choice of after work activities  an application to shanghai a location choice model explains how travellers choose their trip destinations especially for those activities which are flexible in space and time  the model is usually estimated using travel survey data  however  little is known about how to use smart card data  scd  for this purpose in a public transport network  our study extracted trip information from scd to model location choice of after work activities  we newly defined the metrics of travel impedance in this case  moreover  since socio demographic information is missing in such anonymous data  we used observable proxy indicators  including commuting distance and the characteristics of one s home and workplace stations  to capture some interpersonal heterogeneity  such heterogeneity is expected to distinguish the population and better explain the difference of their location choice behaviour  the approach was applied to metro travellers in the city of shanghai  china  as a result  the model performs well in explaining the choices  our new metrics of travel impedance to access an after work activity result in a better model fit than the existing metrics and add additional interpretability to the results  moreover  the proxy variables distinguishing the population seem to influence the choice behaviour and thus improve the model performance  
 using network screening methods to determine locations with specific safety issues  a design consistency case study the highway safety manual provides multiple methods that can be used to identify sites with promise  swips  for safety improvement  however  most of these methods cannot be used to identify sites with specific problems  furthermore  given that infrastructure funding is often specified for use related to specific problems programs  a method for identifying swips related to those programs would be very useful  this research establishes a method for identifying swips with specific issues  this is accomplished using two safety performance functions  spfs   this method is applied to identifying swips with geometric design consistency issues  mixed effects negative binomial regression was used to develop two spfs using 5 years of crash data and over 8754 km of two lane rural roadway  the first spf contained typical roadway elements while the second contained additional geometric design consistency parameters  after empirical bayes adjustments  sites with promise  swips  were identified  the disparity between swips identified by the two spfs was evident  40 unique sites were identified by each model out of the top 220 segments  by comparing sites across the two models  candidate road segments can be identified where a lack design consistency may be contributing to an increase in expected crashes  practitioners can use this method to more effectively identify roadway segments suffering from reduced safety performance due to geometric design inconsistency  with detailed engineering studies of identified sites required to confirm the initial assessment  
 using optical illusions in the shoulder of a cycle path to affect lateral position an important factor in single sided accidents of older cyclists is that they ride off the cycle path onto the verge  two experiments were performed to assess the feasibility of using virtual 3d objects in the verge to affect the lateral position of bicyclists  in the first experiment  different virtual objects were placed in the shoulder and 1150 passing bicyclists were observed using a fixed camera  the  standard deviation of the  lateral position and speed in four conditions with virtual objects differing in colour  structure  or 3d effect were compared with a control condition in which no virtual objects were applied  in a second experiment  the behaviour of 32 bicyclists aged 50 years or older was measured by mounting two digital action cameras with gps on the participants  bicycles  the participants cycled a route of approximately 12 km in which several locations were passed  one of these contained 15 virtual objects similar to the ones used in the first experiment placed in the shoulder of the cycle path  cyclist behaviour was compared with behaviour at a control location consisting of a solitary two way cycle path with a grass shoulder  results indicate that the virtual objects in the tested format had little overall effect on cyclists  behaviour  however  bicyclists were positioned closer to the virtual objects and the shoulder when they looked at the objects or when they reported that they saw them while cycling  this suggests that the overall visibility of the object design may have been too conservative   c  2017 elsevier ltd  all rights reserved  
 using shrp 2 naturalistic driving data to assess drivers  speed choice while being engaged in different secondary tasks introduction  the engagement in secondary tasks while driving has been found to result in considerable impairments of driving performance  texting has especially been suspected to be associated with an increased crash risk  at the same time  there is evidence that drivers use various self regulating strategies to compensate for the increased demands caused by secondary task engagement  one of the findings reported from multiple studies is a reduction in driving speed  however  most of these studies are of experimental nature and do not let the drivers decide for themselves to  not  engage in the secondary task  and therefore  eliminate other strategies of self regulation  e g   postponing the task   the goal of the present analysis was to investigate if secondary task engagement results in speed adjustment also under naturalistic conditions  method  our analysis relied on data of the shrp 2 naturalistic driving study  to minimize the influence of potentially confounding factors on drivers  speed choice  we focused on episodes of free flow driving on interstates highways  driving speed was analyzed before  during  and after texting  smoking  eating  and adjusting monitoring radio or climate control  in a total of 403 episodes  results  data show some indication for speed adjustment for texting  especially when driving with high speed  however  the effect sizes were small and behavioral patterns varied considerably between drivers  the engagement in the other tasks did not influence drivers  speed behavior significantly  conclusions and practical applications  while drivers might indeed reduce speed slightly to accommodate for secondary task engagement  other forms of adaptation  e g   strategic decisions  might play a more important role in a natural driving environment  the use of naturalistic driving data to study drivers  self regulatory behavior at an operational level has proven to be promising  still  in order to obtain a comprehensive understanding about drivers  self regulatory behavior  a mixed method approach is required   c  2017 national safety council and elsevierltd  all rights reserved  
 using simulation to assess the ability of youth to safely operate tractors background  operating farm tractors is dangerous for children  recent studies document mismatches between children and physical requirements for operating tractors  the role of cognition has not been studied  because such research conducted in real life situations places youth at risk  the objective of this study was to evaluate the feasibility and psychometric properties of a simulated virtual tractor environment to examine how children s age and development impacts safe tractor operations  methods  fifty five male youth ages 10 17 living working on farms with experience driving tractors tested the virtual environment and simulation modules  six adult male farmers were recruited as a reference group to compare youth performance with adults  results  the simulation had adequate face validity with realism scores reported between  somewhat  and  quite  realistic  internal reliability of the simulation was excellent  as demonstrated by highly significant intraclass correlations for key indicators of performance  speeds and hazard clearances   while there was some evidence for construct validity  as indicated by trends in performance across the age groups  findings were mixed  conclusion  study findings support using simulation for assessing the abilities of children to safely operate tractors   c  2017 elsevier ltd  all rights reserved  
 using structural equations modeling to explore perceived urban freight deliveries parking issues this paper explores the relations between perceived urban freight delivery parking issues and commercial establishment characteristics  their associated distribution channels  delivery operation patterns and local land use patterns using a structural equations modeling framework  the main motivation is to test hypothesized relations between urban freight delivery parking issues and the aforementioned factors as a way to perform an indirect  but informative  freight infrastructure adequacy assessment  the hypothesized model structure makes it possible to examine  for example  if the distribution channel characteristics  e g   the most frequently used delivery vehicle type  can be linked to a certain type of parking behavior preference  due to operation requirements  which could result in perceived urban freight delivery parking issues  the chosen variables are assembled from a plethora of sources  establishment characteristics include size  number of employees and weekly deliveries  with this data being gathered using an establishment based freight survey  distribution channels are characterized by the predominant delivery agent and vehicle type  delivery operations are represented by the most common parking location  finally  the perceived issues include vehicles blocking other vehicles  lack of loading unloading bays and illegal parking in loading unloading bays  the land use data is obtained from parking records  the openstreetmap repository  the portuguese national statistics institute  e g   information on residents  and the city council s retail establishments  census  the results show that  in general  the hypothesized relationships hold true  perceived urban freight delivery parking issues are a function of the establishment characteristics  their distribution channels and delivery operations patterns  weekly deliveries are dependent on distribution channels and establishment characteristics  finally  weekly deliveries  frequency did not seem to influence the perceived urban freight delivery parking issues  this supports the hypothesis that the retailers  judgement is not biased by the frequency of said operations   c  2016 elsevier ltd  all rights reserved  
 using tactile detection response tasks to assess in vehicle voice control interactions in vehicle information systems  ivis  are becoming more accessible to drivers but also contain more complex communication features  voice control systems are shown to be less distracting than visual manual interfaces  but they can still impose cognitive workload  this study examined the cognitive workload associated with interactions with voice systems while driving  cognitive workload was assessed using a tactile detection response task  tdrt  protocol  a driving simulator study with 48 participants was conducted using an interface with a wizard of oz based voice control system  drivers conducted several voice tasks that included radio channel selection  address navigation  and scheduling a calendar appointment  recognition accuracy and system delay time was manipulated within these voice tasks  using a mixed linear model  cognitive workload was shown to be higher for navigation and calendar tasks when compared to radio tasks  recognition errors and time delays in the calendar task significantly decreased tdrt response time  drivers that are distracted by voice control systems that also contained system delays and errors do not necessarily increase tdrt response time  in fact  drivers may adapt over time to these system imperfections   c  2017 elsevier ltd  all rights reserved  
 using trip diaries to mitigate route risk and risky driving behavior among older drivers to reduce exposure to risky and challenging driving situations and prolong mobility and independence  older drivers self regulate their driving behavior  but self regulation can be challenging because it depends on drivers  ability to assess their limitations  studies using self reports  survey data  and hazard and risk perception tests have shown that driving behavior feedback can help older drivers assess their limitations and adjust their driving behavior  but only limited work has been conducted in developing feedback technology interventions tailored to meet the information needs of older drivers  and the impact these interventions have in helping older drivers self monitor their driving behavior and risk outcomes  the vehicles of 33 drivers 65 years and older were instrumented with obd2 devices  older drivers were provided access to customized web based trip diaries that delivered post trip feedback of the routes driven  low risk route alternatives  and frequency of their risky driving behaviors  data were recorded over four months  with baseline driving behavior collected for one month  generalized linear mixed effects regression models assessed the effects of post trip feedback on the route risk and driving behaviors of older drivers  results showed that post trip feedback reduced the estimated route risk of older drivers by 2 9  per week  and reduced their speeding frequency on average by 0 9  per week  overall  the trip diary feedback reduced the expected crash rate from 1 in 6172 trips to 1 in 7173 trips  and the expected speeding frequency from 46  to 39   thus providing older drivers with tailored feedback of their driving behavior and crash risk could help them appropriately self regulate their driving behavior  and improve their crash risk outcomes   c  2016 elsevier ltd  all rights reserved  
 utility optimization framework for a distributed traffic control of urban road networks route choice behavior has been recognized as an important factor in the traffic management and control strategy design  state of the art research in this field  e g  anticipatory traffic control approaches  often formulates this as a bi level optimization problem where users  reactions to changes in signal control are taken into account in the design of the control policies  solving such a combined optimization problem is possible but difficult and complex which often involves the determination of the dynamic user equilibrium  ue   nevertheless  anticipatory control inherently aims to optimize the signal control that anticipates or reacts to the users  route choice and thus is a reactive control  furthermore  the approaches used in anticipatory control are based on the coupling between control and traffic assignment where the route choice behavior of road users is unrealistically assumed to be in equilibrium  this paper proposes a novel utility based optimization framework to design a distributed control scheme based on a so called backpressure principle that is scalable and proactively influences the drivers  route choice behavior  in particular  as opposed to the well studied anticipatory control and bi level optimization  the proposed utility optimization formulation solves for a system optimal problem where the optimal turning fraction  as an output decision variable  is enforced as a desirable outcome  the optimal turning fractions would then be achieved in a practical deployment either by directly asking the users to follow the systems routing advice or by influencing  i e  manipulating  the route choice decisions made by them so that the resulting turning fraction is  or is close to  the optimal value  although drivers may not follow the computed optimal fractions as desire  there exist several ways  e g  see groot et al   2015   to design appropriate incentives for drivers to follow the route guidance  and thus improve the compliance rate and overall journey experience for everyone inside the network  to this end  we demonstrate by numerical results that better network performance is achieved using the proposed framework even with a limited compliance from the users  furthermore  we have formally proved that our proposed utility optimization based backpressure scheme stabilizes the network for any feasible traffic demands thus maximizing network throughput  in addition  we show through simulation and numerical results that the new policy outperforms the original backpressure based distributed control scheme both in terms of network throughput and other congestion measures such as travel time   c  2017 elsevier ltd  all rights reserved  
 validation of the abrasion resistance test protocols and performance criteria of en13595  the probability of soft tissue injury to motorcycle riders by abrasion resistance of their clothing introduction  motorcyclists represent an increasing proportion of road users globally and are increasingly represented in crash statistics  soft tissue injuries are the most common type of injuries to crashed motorcyclists  these injuries can be prevented through the use of protective clothing designed for motorcycle use  however  the quality of such clothing is not controlled in many countries around the world  a european standard was developed to assess the performance of clothing but as this is not mandatory  clothing certified to this standard is difficult to obtain  given the importance of this standard  and that it has been validated only once  further validation work is required  methods  in depth crash investigation data were used to investigate the relationship between the abrasion resistance performance of clothing and real world injury outcome  clothing was collected from riders who crashed on public roads in sydney and newcastle  australia  this clothing was tested according to the eu standard and the time to hole was recorded  hospital medical records were reviewed and the association between a rider suffering a soft tissue injury and the time to hole for the garment was examined  results  the probability of soft tissue injury for level 1 standard garments was between 40 60   but more than 60  of garments tested failed to meet the minimum requirement  conclusions  the findings of this study provide qualified support for the standard  with a marginal association between time to hole and injury being found  practical implications  this work supports the need for improved safety performance and an increased number of high performing garments being available to motorcyclists   c  2017 national safety council and elsevier ltd  all rights reserved  
 validation of the rakha pasumarthy adjerid car following model for vehicle fuel consumption and emission estimation applications the rakha pasumarthy adjerid  rpa  car following model has been demonstrated to successfully replicate empirical driver car following behavior  however  the validity of this model for fuel consumption and emission  fc em  estimation has yet to be studied  this paper attempts to address this research need by analyzing the applicability of the model for fc em estimation and comparing its performance to other state of practice car following models  namely  the gipps  fritzsche and wiedemann models  naturalistic empirical data are employed to generate ground truth car following events  the model generated second by second vehicle specific power  vsp  distributions for each car following event are then compared to the empirical distributions  the study demonstrates that the generation of realistic vsp distributions is critical in producing accurate fc em estimates and that the rpa model outperforms the other three models in producing realistic vehicle trajectory vsp distributions and robust fc em estimates  this study also reveals that the acceleration behavior within a car following model is one of the major contributors to producing realistic vsp distributions  the study further demonstrates that the use of trip aggregated results may produce erroneous conclusions given that second by second errors may cancel each other out  and that lower vsp distribution errors occasionally result in greater bias in fc em estimates given the large deviation of the distribution at high vsp levels  finally  the results of the study demonstrate the validity of the integration micro simulator  given that it employs the rpa car following model  in generating realistic vsp distributions  and thus in estimating fuel consumption and emission levels   c  2017 elsevier ltd  all rights reserved  
 valuation of active blind spot detection systems by younger and older adults due to their disproportional representation in fatal crashes  younger and older drivers both stand to benefit from in vehicle safety technologies  yet little is known about how they value such technologies  or their willingness to adopt them  the current study investigated older  aged 65 and greater  n 49  and younger  ages 18 23  n 40  adults  valuation of a blind spot monitor and asked if self reported visual difficulties while driving predicted the amount participants were willing to pay for a particular system  bmw s active blind spot detection system  that was demonstrated using a short video  large and small anchor values   250 and  500  respectively  were used as between subjects manipulations to examine the effects of initial valuation  and participants proceeded through a short staircase procedure that offered them either the free installation of the system on their current vehicle or a monetary prize   25  950  that changed in value according to which option they had selected in the previous step of the staircase procedure  willingness to use other advanced driver assistance systems  lane departure warning  automatic lane centering  emergency braking  adaptive cruise control  and self parking systems  was also analyzed  additionally controlling for prior familiarity of those systems  results showed that increased age was associated with a higher valuation for the active blind spot detection system in both the large and small anchor value conditions controlling for income  gender  and technology self efficacy  older adults valued blind spot detection about twice as much   762  as younger adults   383  in the large anchor condition  though both groups  values were in the range for the current cost of an aftermarket system  similarly  age was the most robust positive predictor of willingness to adopt other driving technologies  along with system familiarity  difficulties with driving related visual factors also positively predicting acceptance levels for adaptive cruise control and emergency braking systems  results are discussed in comparison to older adults  willingness to pay for other home based assistive technologies aimed at improving well being and independence   c  2016 elsevier ltd  all rights reserved  
 valuation of travel time reliability in freight transportation  a review and meta analysis of stated preference studies in an effort to advance the understanding of value of reliability  vor  in freight transportation  this paper provides a comprehensive review of existing studies  this study focused on reliability measures adopted by various studies  the theoretical and mathematical foundation of modeling the valuation of reliability  and the contributing factors that influence the values  since nearly all the studies in vor analysis employed stated preference  sp  surveys and the survey design directly affects the study elements and modeling approaches  this synthesis pays close attention to the various survey design components  through a comparative analysis among existing studies  this paper aims to shed some lights on the potential factors that contribute to the variations in vor estimation  the results indicated that the estimated vor values varied largely from one study to another  probably due to the use of different units  reliability measures and survey design approaches  this review showed the complexity and challenges faced when studying freight users  vor  insufficient data has also been cited as a major obstacle to advances in the understanding of how the freight industry values travel time reliability  furthermore  the large variations in the vor values indicate the need for further research efforts in this area   c  2016 elsevier ltd  all rights reserved  
 values of information sharing  a comparison of supplier remanufacturing and manufacturer remanufacturing scenarios this paper investigates values of information sharing in supplier remanufacturing and manufacturer remanufacturing scenarios where the retailer possesses private demand information  in the supplier remanufacturing scenario  the supplier acts as the mere component provider  while in the manufacturer remanufacturing  the supplier acts as both a component provider and a competitor to the manufacturer  we find that information sharing is profitable for both the supplier and the manufacturer  while it is detrimental to the retailer  the supplier with shared information would adjust the wholesale price and acquisition price to reach an equilibrium between forward and reverse flows   c  2017 elsevier ltd  all rights reserved  
 valuing the risk and social costs of road traffic accidents   seasonal variation and the significance of delay costs by using a conventional risk model  and a time loss model for delay  the risk  severity  and social costs of road traffic accidents have been estimated on a rural transport corridor in an area with large seasonal variations  the novelty of the study lies in the comparison of the estimates between seasons  and the inclusion of delay costs when assessing the total social costs of accidents for private motor vehicles and heavy vehicles  increasing congestion in urban areas has motivated researchers  interest in studying the cost of delays due to accidents  however  still many countries  such as norway  do not include delay costs when estimating the social costs of road accidents  in this study  we show that these costs can constitute a significant proportion of the social costs of accidents in rural  areas  particularly during winter in regions with strong seasonal variations  the delay costs on the studied road section constituted on average 10  of total annual social costs of accidents  and were nearly 70  higher than the accidents  material costs  by including these inconvenience costs  we would achieve better estimates of the social costs of accidents  which would in turn give rise to more accurate assessments of the costs and benefits of accident reduction measures  as well as measures reducing the response time when accidents happen  many road safety measures have been aimed at reducing accidents involving death and serious injury  this analysis shows that it can also be beneficial to take measures to reduce the number of less severe accidents  particularly in rural areas where delay costs can be high when the roads are closed because of accidents  it is thus  particularly important that such costs are included in project assessment tools to ensure that rural areas do not lose the fight for road investments  
 variations in mode specific valuations of travel time reliability and in vehicle crowding  implications for demand estimation this paper presents a two stage stated preference survey to investigate the impacts of travel time reliability and in vehicle crowding on the mode choice decisions across four different transport modes  i e  car  metro  park and ride  p r  and bus  the decisive attributes considered are average travel time  travel time reliability  cost and in vehicle crowding  five model specifications are defined for the parameter estimations  significant interaction effects between in vehicle crowding and travel time are found  time multipliers are defined to represent the effects of in vehicle crowding  in contrast  no evidence could be established for the interaction between in vehicle crowding and travel time reliability  results of the mode specific valuations of travel time reliability and in vehicle crowding  vary remarkably across the four different transport modes  in the mode specific models  the range of time multipliers is estimated to be  1 44  2 00   besides  demand estimates would be biased when the mode specific willingness to pay  wtp  is ignored  for instance  the mode share of metro will be underestimated when its reliability level is high  and vice versa  this suggests that mode specific wtp of travel time reliability and in vehicle crowding should be considered in the demand estimations and in the earlier stage of public transport project appraisal   c  2017 elsevier ltd  all rights reserved  
 vehicle kilometers traveled reduction impacts of transit oriented development  evidence from shanghai city the role of residential self selection has become a major subject in the debate over the relationships between the built environment and travel behavior  numerous previous empirical studies on this subject have provided valuable insights into the associations between the built environment and travel behavior  however  the vast majority of the studies were conducted in north american and european cities  yet this research is still in its infancy in most developing countries  including china  where residential and transport choices are likely to be more constrained and travel related attitudes quite different from those in the developed world  using the data collected from 2038 residents currently living in tod neighborhoods and non tod neighborhoods in shanghai city  this paper aims to partly fill the gaps by investigating the causal relationship between the built environment and travel behavior in the chinese context  more specifically  this paper employs heckman s sample selection model to examine the reduction impacts of tod on personal vehicle kilometers traveled  via   controlling for self selection  the results show that whilst the effects of residential self selection are apparent  the built environment exhibits the most significant impacts on travel behavior  playing the dominant role  these findings produce a sound basis for local policymakers to better understand the nature and magnitude toward the impacts of the built environment on travel behavior  providing the government department with reassurance that effective interventions and policies on land use aimed toward altering the built environment would actually lead to meaningful changes in travel behavior   c  2017 elsevier ltd  all rights reserved  
 vehicle routing with roaming delivery locations we propose the vehicle routing problem with roaming delivery locations  vrprdl  to model an innovation in last mile delivery where a customer s order is delivered to the trunk of his car  we develop construction and improvement heuristics for the vrprdl based on two problem specific techniques   1  efficiently optimizing the delivery locations for a fixed customer delivery sequence and  2  efficiently switching a predecessor s or successor s delivery location during the insertion or deletion of a customer in a route  furthermore  we conduct an extensive computation study to assess and quantify the benefits of trunk delivery in a variety of settings  the study reveals that a significant reduction in total distance travelled can be achieved  especially when trunk delivery is combined with traditional home delivery  which has both economic and environmental benefits   c  2017 elsevier ltd  all rights reserved  
 visualisation of uncertainty in probabilistic traffic models for policy and operations this study investigates different methods to visualise uncertainty in static representations of probabilistic traffic models predictions on road networks  although various graphical cues may be used to represent uncertainty it is not a priori clear which of them are most suited for this purpose  since their legibility  intelligibility and the degree to which they interfere with other graphical elements in a representation differ widely  several graphical uncertainty representations were therefore developed and analysed in expert sessions  a selection of the initial set of uncertainty visualisations was further evaluated in a cognitive alternative task switching experiment  the results show that graphical representations are able to convey uncertainty information relatively accurately  while some uncertainty visualisations outperform others  it depends on the model and scenario which representation is most suited for a given application  this paper presents an overview of possible graphic uncertainty representations and the considerations involved when applying them to uncertainty in traffic model visualisations  
 walking behavior across genders in school trips  a case study of rasht  iran although walking behavior in school trips has been the subject of debate in developed countries in recent years  much remains to be learned about this subject in developing countries  moreover  despite exploring effects of various factors  research on walking mode choice behavior across genders remains quite limited  the main purpose of this study is to understand reasons behind male female differences in choosing walking as a mode of transportation in trips to school in the city of rasht  iran  separate binary logit models were developed for boys and girls in trips to school using the data from rasht household travel survey in 2007  results show that high school girls are less likely to walk relative to elementary and middle aged girls  but elementary and middle aged boys dislike walking to school relative to high school boys  results show that regardless of gender  an individual who has a car in his her household is less likely to walk to school  in this study  different distance intervals  increasing by 0 25 miles  were defined  results show that both boys and girls are sensitive to trips longer than 0 25 miles in choosing walking  however  the decrease in likelihood of walking is greater among boys than girls  for example  if the distance is between 0 25 to 0 5 miles  the probability of walking to school decreases by 14 8  points for boys and 10 5  points for girls with respect to trips less than 0 25 miles  altogether  our findings suggest that gender differences need to be addressed if policy makers hope to increase rates of walking in children s trips to school   c  2016 elsevier ltd all rights reserved  
 walking speed of older people and pedestrian crossing time background  traffic lights that regulate the pedestrian crossings in sao paulo  brazil are programmed to consider a standard walking speed of 1 2 m s  m s   however  the frequently slower walking speed of the elderly may make it difficult for them to cross the streets safely and contribute to their social seclusion  objectives  to assess the walking speed of older people living in the community and to compare the results with the international standards for pedestrian crossing  design  a cross sectional  population based study  setting and participants  a probabilistic sample of 1191 individuals aged 60 years or more  living in the city of sao paulo  brazil  in 2010  measurements  walking speed was directly measured using a physical test  and was dichotomously classified using two cut off points  1 1 and 0 9 m s  interviews informed covariates on socio demographic characteristics and health status  results  vast majority  97 8   of older adults in sao paulo walks at a slower pace than is currently demanded by the lights at the pedestrian crossings  1 2 m s   this proportion remained practically unchanged  95 7   when a standard pedestrian walking speed of 1 1 m s is considered  reducing the reference speed to 0 9 m s would narrowed this proportion to 69 7   women  light skinned blacks  poorly educated individuals and those with poorer health were more likely to walk at a slower pace than is required by traffic lights at the pedestrian crossings in the city  conclusions  overwhelming majority of older adults living in sao paulo cannot cross streets at their own walking speed  therefore  there is an urgent need for modifying the traffic environment to prevent accidents involving vulnerable pedestrians and promote urban mobility  
 walking time to school  children s active school travel and their related factors active school travel is one of the main opportunities for promotion of physical activity among children  low physical activity in this group is associated with potential health risks  this research has three aims including two main aims and one intermediate aim  the two main aims were to identify variables that explain why the perceived walking time to school  pwts  is below or above a threshold and to examine the role of pwts as well as socioeconomic status  household factors  parental attitudes towards walking and walking safety on active school travel among children  the intermediate aim was to identify a threshold for the pwts  this threshold may provide information about how to plan transport and roads around schools  data were gathered in rasht  iran in 2014  the 1078 questionnaires were distributed among pupils aged 7 9 years in nine schools  the children were instructed to bring the forms to their parents who completed them  n 735  return rate 80    to predict active school travel  0  inactive modes  1 active modes   and pwts  0 long  1  short  two binary logistic regression analyses were carried out  results showed that a 10 minutes pwts was the threshold where the proportion of active mode use  walking  starts to decrease compared to the best performing alternative mode  higher parental age  or 1 02  and household income  or 1 27   accessibility to public transport  or 0 42   attending public school  or 0 36   access to school service  or 0 45  and contextual and design preconditions for walking  or 0 81  were associated with pwts to eligible schools  pwts  or 15 24  was a strong negative predictor of active school travel  mother s driving license  or 0 49   more owned cars  or 0 53   higher mother s educational degree  or 0 74   accessibility to public transport  or 0 26   and access to school service  or 0 22  were related to active school travel  this research found that pwts is the most important barrier for children s active travelling while adjusting for a wide range of demographics  socio economic variables as well as safety and attitude factors in iran   c  2017 elsevier ltd all rights reserved  
 walking  connecting and befriending  a qualitative pilot study of participation in a lay led walking group intervention lay led walking group interventions to increase physical activity often use community engagement methods to ensure intervention reach and to address the determinants of neighbourhood walking  more needs to be known about how social factors support engagement and maintenance of group activity  this paper presents results from qualitative research on a pilot project in the north of england  uk that sought to increase participation in lay led walking groups run as part of the national walking for health scheme  the  walking for wellness  project included the introduction of a befriending role as a support mechanism  focus groups and individual interviews were used to examine social processes within lay led walking groups and how these processes facilitated participation and led to wellbeing outcomes  the sample comprised walkers attending six health walks  befrienders and professional stakeholders  in total 92 people were interviewed  including 77 walkers  thematic data analysis identified six major themes  pathways to involvement  factors influencing involvement  widening access  befriender role  benefits from participation  and strengthening communities  there was strong qualitative evidence that social factors  which included mutual aid  strengthening of social networks and social support to facilitate participation for those having mild difficulties  facilitated engagement in group based walking  walk participants did not see social benefits as an unanticipated outcome but as integral to the processes of engagement and maintenance of activity  in contrast the introduction of a formal befriending role was seen to lack relevance and raised issues around the stigma associated with poor mental health  the paper concludes that understanding social processes and how they link to health outcomes has implications for the design and evaluation of lay led walking group interventions   c  2017 elsevier ltd all rights reserved  
 warehouse capacity sharing via transshipment for an integrated two echelon supply chain warehouse capacity constraint has been one obstacle to achieving the channel wide optimal decision in inventory management  we studied an integrated inventory model consisting of a single vendor and multiple buyers with warehouse capacity sharing via transshipment  we proposed an optimal transshipment policy by developing nonlinear programming models and genetic algorithms as well as obtaining karush kuhn tucker points  this inventory policy can significantly reduce the channel wide cost and the performance is influenced by the consideration of fixed transshipment costs  sensitivity analyses show that parameters have different impacts on the channel wide cost and the performances of the algorithms   c  2017 published by elsevier ltd  
 what affects our urban travel behavior  a gps based evaluation of internal and external determinants of sustainable mobility in stuttgart  germany  motorized individual transport affects our urban lives negatively regarding its environmental  social and economic aspects  to resolve mobility related issues significantly and in the long term  all of the relevant influences on individual mobility behaviors in an urban environment must be detected  the aim of this paper is therefore to analyze psychological and environmental external factors hypothesized to influence sustainable mobility intentions  as well as their consequent behaviors  on the theoretical basis of an extended version of the  theory of planned behavior   ajzen  1991   a multi methods approach  using person based gps tracking  questioning and an interactive online evaluation  prompted recall survey  are applied  n   73   sixty percent of the variance of sustainable mobility behavior could be explained by our structural equation model  the results of our analysis confirmed significant effects of both intrinsic and external determinants  municipalities  operators of public transport systems and even citizens themselves must pay particular attention to external costs  the habitual usage of sustainable modes of transportation and the difficulties perceived to be associated with sustainable mobility to support it thoroughly   c  2017 elsevier ltd  all rights reserved  
 what are the barriers to widespread adoption of battery electric vehicles  a survey of public perception in tianjin  china battery electric vehicles  bevs  are an effective way to reduce fossil fuel consumptions and greenhouse gas emissions  this study employs the structural equation model and chi square test to explore public perception barriers to widespread adoption of bevs in tianjin  based on a sample of 476 urban respondents collected by questionnaire  it finds that consumer interest in bevs is relatively low and a large proportion of the respondents have a  wait and see  attitude  consumers are unsure about bevs performance  with safety  reliability  and range per charge being the top three concerns  respondents who focus on vehicle performance express significantly lower bev acceptance  high battery cost is the main technological barrier to widespread bev adoption  in terms of public service support  poor public charging infrastructure ranks as the largest impeditive  in terms of respondent personal characteristics  older respondents have a more optimistic attitude to bevs than younger generations  more respondents express interest to adopt bevs as the second family car  experienced drivers are more concerned with the cost of battery and maintenance  and consumers who are more concerned about the environment are more likely to adopt bevs  
 what are the value and implications of two car households for the electric car  the major barriers to a more widespread introduction of battery electric vehicles  bevs  beyond early adopters are the limited range  charging limitations  and costly batteries  an important question is therefore where these effects can be most effectively mitigated  an optimization model is developed to estimate the potential for bevs to replace one of the conventional cars in two car households and to viably contribute to the households  driving demand  it uses data from 1 to 3 months of simultaneous gps logging of the movement patterns for both cars in 64 commuting swedish two car households in the gothenburg region  the results show that  for home charging only  a flexible vehicle use strategy can considerably increase bev driving and nearly eliminate the unfulfilled driving in the household due to the range and charging limitations with a small battery  the present value of this flexibility is estimated to be on average  6000  7000 but varies considerably between households  with possible near future prices for bevs based on mass production cost estimates  this flexibility makes the total cost of ownership  tco  for a bev advantageous in almost all the investigated households compared to a conventional vehicle or a hybrid electric vehicle  because of the ubiquity of multi car households in developed economies  these families could be ideal candidates for the initial efforts to enhance bev adoptions beyond the early adopters  the results of this research can inform the design and marketing of cheaper bevs with small but enough range and contribute to increased knowledge and awareness of the suitability of bevs in such households   c  2017 the author s   published by elsevier ltd  
 what do we know about rail suicide incidents  an analysis of 257 fatalities on the rail network in great britain there are over 250 suicides on the railway network in great britain each year  descriptive statistics are compiled  producing national and international data  the industry knows how many and  to a limited extent  where these fatalities occur  there is little in depth analysis of events  therefore  there are gaps in knowledge of these fatalities and this can be a weakness when considering the best approaches to prevention  this paper reports on the analysis of data on 257 suicide events at or near to 51 stations on three rail routes in great britain over a 20 year period  the analysis uses data from the industry safety management information system database and produces simple descriptive statistics on a range of variables  including comparisons across the three rail routes  additional data from staff and route based documentation have been used to verify  supplement and interpret information in the database  examples of patterns of immediate and precursor behaviours during incidents have been presented  illustrating the potential to explore both common and anomalous behaviours during events  the findings demonstrate the type of content that can be explored within the industry data and through use of other data that are available within the industry  commentaries have been provided on the strengths and weaknesses of the data and how findings from the analysis can be used to improve future data collection and prevention of incidents  
 what drives co2 emissions from china s civil aviation  an exploration using a new generalized pda method understanding the main drivers contributing to the increased co2 emitted by airlines can inform carbon reduction policies for the civil aviation sector  production decomposition analysis  pda  is a theoretical tool widely used to investigate the factors influencing changes in co2 emissions  instead of the standard constant returns to scale assumption  the study proposes a new generalized pda method that considers the influence of changes in scale efficiency  the study used a panel data set for china s airlines during the period of 2007 2013 to conduct an empirical analysis and generate meaningful results  first  it was found that changes in revenue ton kilometers is the largest factor contributing to increased civil aviation co2 emissions  second  changes in potential energy intensity play a dominant role in decreasing co2 emissions for most airlines  third  changes in production technology effects exert a relatively small influence on co2 emissions  and the effect of scale efficiency change positively contributes to curbing co2 emissions  based on the pda analysis  we propose policy implications related to civil aviation of china   c  2017 elsevier ltd  all rights reserved  
 what influences the decision to use automated public transport  using utaut to understand public acceptance of automated road transport systems the main aim of this study was to use an adapted version of the unified theory of acceptance and use of technology  utaut  to investigate the factors that influence users  acceptance of automated road transport systems  arts   a questionnaire survey was administered to 315 users of a citymobil2 arts demonstration in the city of trikala  greece  results provide evidence of the usefulness of the utaut framework for increasing our understanding of how public acceptance of these automated vehicles might be maximised  hedonic motivation  or users  enjoyment of the system  had a strong impact on behavioural intentions to use arts in the future  with performance expectancy  social influence and facilitating conditions also having significant effects  the anticipated effect of effort expectancy did not emerge from this study  suggesting that the level of effort required is unlikely to be a critical factor in consumers  decisions about using arts  based on these results  a number of modifications to utaut are suggested for future applications in the context of automated transport  it is recommended that designers and developers should consider the above issues when implementing more permanent versions of automated public transport   c  2017 elsevier ltd  all rights reserved  
 what led to the establishment of a rail oriented city  determinants of urban rail supply in tokyo  japan  1950 2010 this study analyzed the determinants of urban rail supply in tokyo using time series data for the postwar period  it modeled urban rail supply  measured by vehicle kilometers of the urban rail service  incorporating demand for urban rail travel  urban rail travel speed  conditions of alternative transportation modes  land use patterns  and socioeconomic conditions as explanatory variables  the model adopted a lag structure for urban rail supply in line with the planning horizon  it was then estimated using the bayesian model averaging approach  which provided robust estimation results based on our multivariate time series data  the results showed that investments in the urban rail network in tokyo were primarily driven by the increase in demand for urban rail travel  in effect  demand growth in the tokyo rail network has clearly translated to supply growth through the planning process  this induced supply has worked as one of the critical components in the establishment of a rail oriented transportation system in tokyo  additionally  the negative effects of bus tram travel speed on urban rail supply were estimated

 what role for offsetting aviation greenhouse gas emissions in a deep cut carbon world  the long term goal of containing average warming below the 2 degrees c limit requires deep cuts in emissions from all sectors  the fast growing global aviation industry has committed to reduce carbon emissions  carbon offsetting is an integral element of the sector s strategy  already  airlines offer voluntary carbon offsetting to those customers who wish to mitigate the impact of their travel  to ensure carbon offsetting can make a meaningful and credible contribution  this paper first discusses the science behind  carbon offsetting   followed by the associated policy perspective  then  against the context of different aviation emissions pathways  the paper provides empirical evidence of current airline practices in relation to offsetting mechanisms and communication  building on these insights  the challenges of reducing aviation emissions and using carbon credits to compensate for ongoing growth are discussed  the paper concludes by proposing five principles of best practice for carbon offsetting that airlines can use as a basis to develop credible emissions strategies  and that could inform the sectoral framework currently being developed by leading aviation organisations   c  2017 elsevier ltd  all rights reserved  
 what walking means to moms  insights from a national sample to frame walking in compelling ways to low income urban mothers population wide initiatives aim to educate individuals about the benefits of walking  such as step it up   united states   walking for health  england   and canada walks  canada   low income women are a strategic group to target for walking communications because lower income individuals and women have lower rates of physical activity than the general population and men  for messages to motivate mothers to walk  however  they need to frame walking in ways that makes walking sufficiently relevant and compelling  we investigated what walking means to low income urban mothers as a first step toward identifying more compelling and motivating ways to frame and communicate about walking to them  focus groups were conducted across seven different urban areas in the united states among low income urban mothers  n 52  and transcribed  grounded theory was used to code and analyze the data  this study identified salient beliefs  barriers  and life concerns that should be addressed when framing and branding walking to low income urban mothers  communications emphasizing dose based recommendations  e g   time  intensity  are irrelevant to mothers  lives and also appear to be confusing as well as ineffective motivators  while some participants desired experiential benefits from walking  such as time with family  others sought instrumental benefits  such as losing weight  regardless of the benefits desired  however  there was a general consensus that walking was a low daily priority  thus  for messages to successfully promote walking  they need to imbue walking with a compelling meaning that makes walking relevant to mothers in ways that can help them achieve their daily needs and wants  in addition  future communications should address the potentially negative meanings and stress low income mothers experience when walking is a compulsory form of transportation  these data offer insights into preliminary suggestions for framing walking to boost its daily relevance  desirability  and usefulness to low income urban mothers   c  2016 elsevier ltd all rights reserved  
 when adjacent lane dependencies dominate the uncongested regime of the fundamental relationship this paper presents an empirical study of the fundamental relationship between speed  v  and flow  q   denoted vqfr  under low flow in the uncongested regime  using new analytical techniques to extract more information from loop detector data  the vqfr from a time of day hov lane exhibits high v that slowly drops as q increases  this curve arises after binning several million vehicles by q and only considering those bins with q   1200 vph  a surprising thing happens when further binning the data by the adjacent lane speed  v2   the vqfr expands in to a fan of curves that decrease in magnitude and slope with decreasing v2  yet each curve in the fan continues to exhibit uncongested trends  ranging from a flat curve consistent with recent editions of the highway capacity manual to downward sloping curves  it is shown that this behavior was not due to the hov operations per se  the same behavior also arises in the non hov period when the lane serves all vehicles and it is also observed at another facility without any hov restrictions  this dependency on the adjacent lane is absent from most traffic flow theories  taking a broader view  four different factors appear to limit the speed a driver takes   i  the roadway geometry   ii  the posted speed limit   iii  the vehicle ahead  car following   and  iv  traffic conditions in the adjacent lane  whichever constraint is most binding determines the driver s speed  while the first three constraints are found in the literature  this work contributes the fourth  as per above  when the speed limit is the most binding constraint the uncongested regime of the vqfr is roughly flat with a near constant speed over a wide range of q  when the roadway geometry is the binding constraint  e g   due to the lack of speed limits  drivers are able to travel fast enough to be sensitive to the vehicle ahead and exhibit lower v as q increases  car following is by definition in the congested regime and thus  beyond the scope of this paper  finally  the present work shows that as the adjacent lane moves slower  the uncongested drivers choose speeds below the speed limit and once more exhibit lower v as q increases  although the chosen v is below the speed limit  the drivers continue to exhibit behavior consistent with the uncongested regime   c  2017 elsevier ltd  all rights reserved  
 when does alcohol hurt  a driving simulator study world wide  alcohol is still a major cause of traffic accidents  the dose related accident risk function has been found in a large number of risk studies  a plethora of laboratory studies has examined the effect of alcohol with regard to different information processing capabilities of drivers  summarizing the results  alcohol effects occur at lower blood alcohol concentrations  bac  the more complex the tasks get  however  in contrast  typical alcohol related crashes are frequently single vehicle crashes but not so often crashes in complex situations like at intersections  it may be that the subjective assessment of the traffic situation and the adaptation of behavior under the influence of alcohol plays a major role in accident causation  in order to examine this hypothesis  two driving simulator studies were conducted at a target bac of 0 5 g l comparing two  alcohol vs  placebo  n   48  experiment 1  and three  sober  placebo and alcohol  n   63  experiment 2  groups of subjects in two critical scenarios  the first scenario was a seemingly easy traffic situation and was supposed to lead to a relaxed driving behavior under alcohol  the second scenario involved a complex intersection situation where especially drivers under the influence of alcohol should try to concentrate and compensate their experienced alcohol effects  in all scenarios  a critical object appeared suddenly and the driver had to react fast in order to prevent a  simulated  accident  overall  the results support the hypothesis  accidents were more frequent for alcohol drivers as compared to placebo sober drivers in the easy scenario  but not the complex one  the initial speed of the driver when entering the scenario seems to play a major role in the accident causation  drivers under the influence of alcohol seem to lower their speed in complex scenarios  possibly to thus counteract alcohol effects  in seemingly easy scenarios this does not seem necessary for them and the arousing effect of alcohol may contribute to driving faster  the results are summarized in a model of alcohol related crashes  further in depth analyses of real crashes would be an interesting next step to further corroborate this model  
 when human beings are like drunk robots  driverless vehicles  ethics  and the future of transport it is often argued that driverless vehicles will save lives  in this paper  we treat the ethical case for driverless vehicles seriously and show that it has radical implications for the future of transport  after briefly discussing the current state of driverless vehicle technology  we suggest that systems that rely upon human supervision are likely to be dangerous when used by ordinary people in real world driving conditions and are unlikely to satisfy the desires of consumers  we then argue that the invention of fully autonomous vehicles that pose a lower risk to third parties than human drivers will establish a compelling case against the moral permissibility of manual driving  as long as driverless vehicles aren t safer than human drivers  it will be unethical to sell them  once they are safer than human drivers when it comes to risks to 3rd parties  then it should be illegal to drive them  at that point human drivers will be the moral equivalent of drunk robots  we also describe two plausible mechanisms whereby this ethical argument may generate political pressure to have it reflected in legislation  freeing people from the necessity of driving  though  will transform the relationship people have with their cars  which will in turn open up new possibilities for the transport uses of the automobile  the ethical challenge posed by driverless vehicles for transport policy is therefore to ensure that the most socially and environmentally beneficial of these possibilities is realised  we highlight several key policy choices that will determine how likely it is that this challenge will be met   c  2017 elsevier ltd  all rights reserved  
 who s calling  social networks and mobile phone use among motorcyclists mobile phone use while riding a motorcycle poses a key safety risk  particularly among younger people who have been found to be more susceptible to distracted driving  while previous research has examined the influence of social networks on mobile phone use while driving a car  no research has explored this association in the context of motorcycle use  using a survey of university students in vietnam  this research explores the association between social networks and mobile phone use among motorcyclists and the links this has to reported crashes falls  results show that the majority of students are most likely to use a mobile phone to communicate with a friend while riding  either through talking  56 5   or text messaging  62 0    however  respondents who frequently talk to a girlfriend boyfriend or spouse while riding were more likely to experience a crash fall than those who frequently talk with others while riding  e g  parent  brother sister   in addition  those who frequently text message a friend while riding were more likely to experience a crash fall than those who frequently text message others while riding  the results highlight a clear association between social networks and mobile phone use while riding a motorcycle  developing a culture of societal norms  where mobile phone use while riding a motorcycle is considered socially unacceptable  will help to reduce the prevalence and ultimate crash risk associated with mobile phone use while riding  
 why is steering not the same as braking  the impact of non driving related tasks on lateral and longitudinal driver interventions during conditionally automated driving with the ongoing trend towards conditional automation in the automotive industry  it is vital to ensure that drivers are able to resume vehicle control within the given time budget   even when engaging in non driving related tasks  a driving simulator study was conducted to examine the impact of non driving related tasks on drivers  ability to take over vehicle control  the task consisted of reading or proofreading a text  low vs  high visual cognitive task load  on a tablet which was either handheld or mounted in the vehicle  low vs  high manual task load   data from 95 participants  mean age 38 years  47 females  were used to examine reaction times and take over quality in time critical steering and braking maneuvers  manual task load was found to prolong reaction times and to deteriorate take over quality  surprisingly  drivers needed even longer for the first gaze at the roadway when holding the tablet in their hands  as expected  these effects were stronger in the steering compared to the braking maneuver  effects of cognitive task load were found to be dependent on the type of driver intervention  while reaction times and take over quality deteriorated with increasing cognitive load in the steering maneuver  hardly any effects were found in the braking maneuver  a possible explanation for this surprising finding could be that especially drivers who are intensively engaging in non driving related tasks spontaneously react with braking to defuse the situation and gain more time  it is thus argued that cognitively demanding non driving related tasks during automated driving do not necessarily lead to deteriorated take over performance  depending on situational characteristics like the required reaction or the perceptual complexity of the situation  these might have different effects on the drivers  ability to take over   c  2017 elsevier ltd  all rights reserved  
 wider economic impacts of transport infrastructure investments  relevant or negligible  wider economic impacts  wei  comprise all effects that are not assessed appropriately in conventional cost benefit analysis  cba   these effects are generated by market imperfections  in the view of neo classical equilibrium theory  in real economies such imperfections are not exemptions but frequent phenomena  e g  stemming from increasing returns to scale or scope  or structural changes of products and industrial processes  although the existence of wei is not in question  they are usually not considered in practical assessments of transport infrastructure investments because they can only be estimated with high uncertainty and in industrialised countries in particular   they are assumed to be of negligible magnitude  this paper presents approaches to wei measurement based on gdp and on welfare  analyses the feasibility for combining wei with conventional cba  and discusses issues related to decision making in situations where consideration of wei appears to be relevant

 willingness to pay for safety improvements in passenger air travel the risk of being involved in an airplane accident is largely ignored in air passengers  choice models  the reason presumably is that it is hard to operationalize  because objective safety indicators often involve extremely low probabilities that are hard to grasp and interpret by passengers  in this paper  we propose an operationalization that is based on the perception of safety  which is easy to understand and resonates that perceptions often influence decisions stronger than objective variables  we conceptualize that passengers form a safety perception score of a particular flight based on their perception of airline and route attributes and that this score in turn is traded off against other flight attributes  such as ticket costs  to arrive at a flight choice  in line with this conceptualization  two stated preference experiments are conducted  in a first experiment  combinations of airline and route attributes are evaluated in terms of safety that is captured on a rating scale  in a second experiment  safety perception is treated as an attribute and traded off against other flight attributes to arrive at a flight choice  the paper presents the results of a regression and a panel mixed logit model estimated from responses obtained from a convenience sample of 161 air passengers recruited in the netherlands  the results of both models are then combined to calculate the willingness to pay values for improvements made to a range of airline and route attributes  taking into account socio demographic variables and psychological traits  as expected  the results indicate that the willingness to pay for improving safety decreases with higher initial safety levels   c  2017 elsevier ltd  all rights reserved  
 wooded area  forest road killed animals  intensity and seasonal differences of road mortality on a small  newly upgraded road in western romania the roads are one of the most obvious expressions of modern society  being considered vital for economical growth  nevertheless  roads have a very strong negative impact upon environment  manifested  among others  by road mortality  in romania numerous minor roads are currently upgraded and asphalted  in the year 2016  on a road of this kind  in a wooded mountain area  we recorded 1628 road killed animals belonging to 48 taxons  the majority were forest and wet areas animals  earthworms  snails  amphibians  etc   characteristic for the road s vicinity  flying or dry areas animals were fewer  the road crosses the forest and the wet areas animals  habitats  now  they are certain victims on the road  because its recent upgrade had increased the cars  speed  road mortality differed between periods and according to the road surroundings aspect  the highest road mortality intensity was registered at the end of the spring  it has dropped in the summer and then rose again in the autumn  but just moderately  the animals were affected according to their life cycle and ecological demands  on this minor road surrounded by relatively uniform wooded habitats  the road mortality differences were determined in the first place by the demandings and life cycle of the victims  which were affected by meteorological conditions  this studied road is a proof of how forest native animals are exposed once their habitat is crossed by a road   c  2017 elsevier ltd  all rights reserved  
 work zone sign design for increased driver compliance and worker safety many studies have investigated the effect of dynamic message signs  dms  on drivers  speed reduction and compliance in work zones  yet only a few studies have examined the design of sign content of dms  the purpose of this study was to develop design standards for dms to improve driver compliance and worker safety  this study investigated the impact of sign content  frame refresh rate  and sign placement on driver speed reduction  compliance  and eye movements  a total of 44 participants were recruited for this study  each participant completed 12 simulated driving tasks in a high fidelity driving simulator  a small scale field study was also conducted to test the effect of dms on vehicle speed in a highway work zone  results showed sign content and placement had no impact on speed reduction and compliance  however  sign frame refresh rate was found to have a significant effect on drivers  initial speed and speed reduction  participants had longer fixation duration on dms when worker presence was mentioned in the sign content  results of the field study suggested that the dms is most effective at night

 workers  compensation loss prevention representative contact and risk of lost time injury in construction policyholders introduction  insurance loss prevention  lp  representatives have access and contact with businesses and employees to provide targeted safety and health resources  construction firms  especially those smaller in size  are a high risk population  this research evaluated the association between lp rep contact and risk for lost time injuries in construction policyholders  methods  workers  compensation data were utilized to track lp rep contact with policyholders and incidence of lost time injury over time  survival analysis with repeated events modeling calculated hazard ratios  hr  and 95  confidence intervals  ci   results  compared no lp contact  one contact was associated with a 27  reduction of risk  hr   0 73  ci   0 65 0 82   two with a 41   hr   0 59  ci   0 51 0 68   and three or more contacts with a 28  reduction of risk  hr   0 72  ci   0 65 0 81   conclusions  lp reps appear to be a valuable partner in efforts to reduce injury burden  their presence or contact with policyholders is consistent with reduction in overall incidence of lost time injuries  practical applications  reduction in lost time injuries  resulting in reduced workers  compensation costs for policyholders and insurance companies  builds a business case for safety and injury prevention  lp reps are often a low or no cost benefit for insurance policyholders and may be an important injury prevention resource for small firms and or those with lack of safety resources and staff   c  2017 the authors  national safety council and elsevier ltd  
 worldwide railway skeleton network  extraction methodology and preliminary analysis understanding and improving global mobility has gained increased interest during the last decades  however  studies on the railway network are spatially limited so far  mostly investigating the domestic network of a country  data availability is a major limiting factor for the analysis of these networks  despite the increased open data movement  network operators are often reluctant to publish their infrastructure and passenger data  existing large scale studies usually make use of hand collected data  for instance  based on historical cartographies  in this paper  we develop and implement a methodology to extract the worldwide railway skeleton network from the open data repository openstreetmap  where nodes are stations waypoints and links are weights with information such as spatial distance  gauge  and maximum speed  we describe how we solved several data cleansing and scalability issues and developed network simplification techniques  in order to obtain an adequate representation of the network  we show that the network breaks down into few large and many small components  furthermore  we show that this public data set can be used for efficient minimum travel time estimation between stations or cities  this paper leads to the development of a new research data set and contributes toward the ability of analyzing global mobility patterns  particularly regarding multimodality and cross country transportation  
 wrong way driving crashes  a multiple correspondence approach to identify contributing factors objective  wrong way driving  wwd  crashes result in 1 34 fatalities per fatal crash  whereas for other non wwd fatal crashes this number drops to 1 10  as such  further in depth investigation of wwd crashes is necessary  the objective of this study is 2 fold  to identify the characteristics that best describe wwd crashes and to verify the factors associated with wwd occurrence methods  we collected and analyzed 15years of crash data from the states of illinois and alabama  the final data set includes 398 wwd crashes  the rarity of wwd events and the consequently small sample size of the crash database significantly influence the application of conventional log linear models in analyzing the data  because they use maximum likelihood estimation  to overcome this issue  in this study  we employ multiple correspondence analysis  mca  to define the structure of the crash data set and identify the significant contributing factors to wwd crashes on freeways results  the results of the present study specify various factors that characterize and influence the probability of wwd crashes and can thus lead to the development of several safety countermeasures and recommendations  according to the obtained results  factors such as driver age  driver condition  roadway surface conditions  and lighting conditions were among the most significant contributors to wwd crashes conclusions  despite many other methods that identify only the contributing factors  this method can identify possible associations between various contributing factors  this is an inherent advantage of the mca method  which can provide a major opportunity for state departments of transportation  dots  to select safety countermeasures that are associated with multiple safety benefits  
 you are what you drive  environmentalist and social innovator symbolism drives electric vehicle adoption intentions electric vehicles  evs  have the potential to dramatically reduce vehicle emissions contributing to climate change without significantly reducing convenience or mobility  despite their potential  ev market share remains low  necessitating research to identify factors that could encourage more widespread adoption  for instance  concern about climate change is associated with intent to adopt an ev  but little is known about mechanisms through which this concern may translate into action  this study builds on previous work investigating the roles of symbolic and instrumental attributes in low emission vehicle adoption  focusing exclusively on evs to better understand perceptions associated with their unique technical capabilities  prior work has examined symbolism rather generally  e g   in terms of status   we examine specific aspects of self identity that evs may reflect  representing the extent to which consumers perceive evs as symbols that they are environmentalists and or social innovators  in addition  extending prior work  we quantify the relative influence of these separate aspects of symbolism on ev adoption intentions alongside instrumental  psychological  and demographic factors  we find differing impacts of these two symbols on ev adoption intentions  environmentalist symbolism is consistently the strongest predictor of adoption  across three dependent variables  innovator symbolism predicts willingness to lease buy an ev  trailing only environmentalist symbolism in effect size  and outperforming instrumental attributes as well as psychological and demographic factors  additionally  we examine a potential mechanism through which concern about climate change may translate into ev adoption intentions  we find that seeing evs as environmentalist and social innovator symbols partially mediates the relationship between concern about climate change and ev adoption intentions  these results have implications for ev marketing and policy  and suggest that emphasizing the potential for evs to reinforce specific self identities may be a more promising strategy to increase adoption rates than emphasizing instrumental attributes such as fuel efficiency   c  2017 elsevier ltd  all rights reserved  
 young females at risk while driving with a small child introduction  previous research suggests that young mothers with little driving experience are at risk when driving with a small child passenger  in this study we examined the prevalence  characteristics and risk of fatal motor vehicle crashes involving an infant passenger under the age of one among female drivers of different ages  methods  we used crash data from the us fatality analysis reporting system for 1994 2013  the prevalence of fatal crashes involving infants was examined by age of female drivers and compared to the number of births among mothers of a similar age  the essential characteristics of the crashes were described  and the odds of being at fault were determined for young  16 24 year olds  and older female drivers  25 39 year olds  with an infant passenger or with no passengers  results  the prevalence of fatal crashes involving infant passengers was higher among young female drivers in relation to the number of births among mothers of a similar age than among older females  young female drivers with an infant passenger were more often at fault than older drivers  aor   1 83  95   ci   1 52  2 20   their vehicles were older and smaller and they used proper safety seats for infants less often than the older drivers  in addition  young female drivers with an infant passenger but with no adult passenger in the vehicle were more often at fault than young female drivers with no passengers  aor   1 27  95  ci   1 06  1 51   both young and older female drivers  crashes involving an infant passenger typically occurred in ordinary driving conditions  but these drivers with infant passengers were more often reported as having fallen asleep or inattentive than those with no passengers  the presence of an adult passenger in addition to an infant passenger lowered female drivers  odds of being at fault  regardless of the driver s age  conclusions  young females driving with an infant passenger  probably most often mothers  are at an elevated risk of a fatal crash  especially when they drive alone with an infant  the protective effect of an adult passenger suggests that another adult in the vehicle can assist the driver by taking care of the infant and enabling the driver to focus on driving  
 young male drivers  risky driving 15 months after licensure   the role of intervention  attitudes towards accompanied driving  and parents  risk an indispensable issue in contemporary research on risk taking by young drivers is parents  influence on their offspring s driving behavior  the current study measures this influence by using a risk index of parents  driving behavior measured via in vehicle data recorders together with young drivers  self reported answers to a set of questionnaires  both parents and young drivers participated in one of three intervention program groups to enhance safe driving within a longitudinal study  and the outcome of this intervention was measured 15 months following licensure  the aim of the current study was thus to assess the contribution of parents  actual driving behavior  participation in the intervention  and teen drivers  attitudes towards accompanied driving  measured six months after licensure   to the reported risky driving of the young drivers fifteen months after receiving their driving license  the data consist of a sample of 78 parent young driver dyads who were originally randomly assigned to one of three intervention groups  receiving different forms of feedback  or a control group  with no feedback   findings indicate that the feedback and training to parents intervention group  as well as parents  risky driving events rate  were positively associated with the reported proneness to reckless driving and the reckless driving habits of the young drivers  in addition  lower perception of accompanied driving as enabling a sense of relatedness with parents  and higher negative perceptions of this period  were related to higher reported risky driving among young drivers fifteen months after licensure  the results highlight the importance of parents  behavior and relationships with their offspring as key concepts in moderating risky driving among young drivers  practical implications for road safety are discussed   c  2017 elsevier ltd  all rights reserved
